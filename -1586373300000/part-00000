He campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]]\u2014including the right for Catholics to sit in the [[Westminster Parliament]], denied for over 100 years\u2014and repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] which combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThroughout his career in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his [[Catholic Association]]. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political [[reformism]], working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the [[Young Ireland]] movement.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Connell was born at Carhan near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]], to the [[O'Connells of Derrynane]], a wealthy Roman Catholic family  that had been dispossessed of its lands. His parents were Morgan O'Connell  and Catherine O'Mullane. Among his uncles was [[Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell]], an officer in the Irish Brigades of the [[French Army]].  A famous aunt was [[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]], while [[Sir James O'Connell, 1st Baronet]], was his younger brother.  Under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle [[Maurice O'Connell (Hunting Cap)|Maurice \"Hunting Cap\" O'Connell]]. O'Connell was first sent with his brother Maurice to Reddington Academy at Long Island, near Queenstown (Cobh)<ref>J. J. Fr. Harrington's Reddington Academy Walterstown (Baile Ualtair) is a townland in Cobh Rural ED, in Templerobin Civil Parish, in Barony, in Co. Cork, Ireland. O'Kelly \"O'Connell Calling: the Liberator\u2019s place in the world\" (Kerryman, 1949)</ref> They both studied at [[Douai]] in France from 1790 and O'Connell was admitted as a [[barrister]] to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1794, transferring to [[Dublin]]'s [[King's Inns]] two years later. In his early years, he became acquainted with the pro-democracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\">{{cite book | last = Boylan | first = Henry | year = 1998 | title = A Dictionary of Irish Biography | edition = 3rd | page = 306 | location = Dublin | publisher = Gill and MacMillan | isbn = 0-7171-2945-4 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:O'Connells Home At Derrynane Abby.JPG|thumb|left|O'Connell's home at [[Derrynane House|Derrynane]]]]\nWhile in Dublin studying for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions not to become involved in any militia activity. When [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]]'s [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion fleet]] entered [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement.<ref name=\"Gywnn\">\nDennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pg 71</ref> Dennis Gwynn in his ''Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator'' suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people\u2014of which he was one.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" /> He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nAs a law student, O'Connell was aware of his own talents, but the higher ranks of the Bar were closed to him. He read the ''[[Jockey Club]]'' as a picture of the governing class in England and was persuaded by it that, \"vice reigns triumphant in the English court at this day. The spirit of [[liberty]] shrinks to protect property from the attacks of French innovators. The corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments.\"<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nO'Connell's studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of Ireland, and the debates of the Historical Society concerned the records of governments, and from this he was to conclude, according to one of his biographers, \"in Ireland the whole policy of the Government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority\".<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nOn 3 January 1797, in an atmosphere of alarm over the French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay, he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and \"being young, active, healthy and single\" he could offer no plausible excuse.<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 24a</ref> Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.<ref>O'Ferrall, F., ''Daniel O'Connell, Dublin'', 1981, p. 12</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1798, O'Connell was called to the [[Irish Bar]] and became a [[barrister]]. Four days later, the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] staged their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] which was put down by the British with great bloodshed. O'Connell did not support the rebellion; he believed that the Irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force.\n\nHe went on the [[Munster]] circuit, and for over a decade, he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of Ireland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was reputed to have the largest income of any Irish barrister but, due to natural extravagance and a growing family, was usually in debt; his brother remarked caustically that Daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen. Although he was ultimately to inherit Derrynane from his uncle Maurice, the old man lived to be almost 100 and in the event Daniel's inheritance did not cover his debts.\n\nHe also condemned [[Robert Emmet]]'s [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Rebellion of 1803]]. Of Emmet, a Protestant, he wrote: \"A man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed, so many murders\u2014and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion.\"<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 97</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to the use of violence, he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes, particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused, as in the [[Doneraile]] conspiracy trials of 1829, his last notable court appearance. He was noted for his fearlessness in court: if he thought poorly of a judge (as was very often the case) he had no hesitation in making this clear. Most famous perhaps was his retort to [[James McClelland (Solicitor-General)|Baron McClelland]], who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course O'Connell had adopted: O'Connell said that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, neither would he take directions from him as a judge.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in, Sean (1936). ''King of the Beggars: a life of Daniel O'Connell''. Alan Figgis reissue, p. 97</ref> He did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself: in particular he was attracted by the position of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], yet although he was offered it more than once, finally refused.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mary O'Connell.tif|thumb| 1836 Portrait of Mary O'Connell by John Gubbins]]\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|left|Daniel O'Connell, in an 1836 watercolour by Bernard Mulrenin. <!--''Daniel O'Connell'', 1836, by [[Bernard Mulrenin]]-->]]\n[[File:St Patricks Cathedral (Daniel O'Connell Statue).jpg|thumb|Statue of Daniel O'Connell outside [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]]|alt=]]In 1802 O'Connell married his third cousin, [[Mary O'Connell (1778-1836)|Mary O'Connell]]. It was a love marriage, and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) and for a time threatened to disinherit them.<ref>Geoghegan  ''King Dan''  pp.94\u20137</ref> They had four daughters (three surviving), [[Ellen Bridget O'Connell|Ellen]] (1805\u20131883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons\u2014[[Maurice O'Connell (MP)|Maurice]] (1803), [[Morgan O'Connell|Morgan]]  (1804), [[John O'Connell (MP)|John]] (1810), and [[Daniel O'Connell Jnr|Daniel]] (1816)\u2014all sat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faol\u00e1in suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in p.87</ref>\n\n=== O'Connell's Ale and connection with the 'licensed trade' ===\nO'Connell assisted his younger son, Daniel junior, to acquire the Phoenix Brewery in James's Street, Dublin in 1831.<ref>''Irish Whiskey: A 1000 Year Tradition'', Malachy Magee, O'Brien Press, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-86278-228-7}}. pg 68\u201374.</ref> The brewery produced a brand known as \"O'Connell's Ale\" and enjoyed some popularity. By 1832, O'Connell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his son's company, until he was no longer a member of parliament, particularly because O'Connell and [[Arthur Guinness]] were political enemies. Guinness was the \"moderate\" liberal candidate, O'Connell was the \"radical\" liberal candidate. The rivalry caused dozens of Irish firms to boycott Guinness during the 1841 Repeal election. It was at this time that Guinness was accused of supporting the \"Orange system\", and its beer was known as \"Protestant porter\". When the O'Connell family left brewing, the rights to \"O'Connell Dublin Ale\" was sold to John D'Arcy. The brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though, and after a few years was taken over by the manager, John Brennan, while Daniel junior embraced a political career. Brennan changed the name back to the Phoenix Brewery but continued to brew and sell O'Connell's Ale. When the Phoenix Brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the Guinness complex in 1909, the brewing of O'Connell's Ale was carried out by John D'Arcy and Son Ltd at the Anchor Brewery in Usher Street. In 1926, D'Arcy's ceased trading and the firm of Watkins, Jameson and Pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with Guinness.<ref>T. Halpin: History of the Irish Brewing Industry, 1988</ref><ref name=\"sim\">[http://www.simtec.us/dublinbrewing/history.html History of Brewing in Dublin]</ref>\n\nDaniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to Daniel O'Connell in his public life. Some time later a quarrel arose and O'Connell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]. During the period of [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Fr. Mathew]]'s total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held, the most notable being a huge rally held on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 1841. Daniel O'Connell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the [[Rotunda Hospital]].<ref name=\"sim\" /><ref>St Martin Magazine (ISSN 1393-1008), June 2003 St Martin Apostolate, Dublin</ref>\n\n== Political beliefs and programme ==\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell2.jpg|thumb|\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\" poster published in [[Pennsylvania]], 1847]]\n\nA critic of violent insurrection ''in Ireland'', O'Connell once said that \"the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood\", and yet as late as 1841, O'Connell had whipped his MPs into line to keep the [[First Opium War|(First) Opium War]] going in China. The Tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war, and O'Connell had to call upon his MPs to support the Whig Government. As a result of this intervention, the Government was saved.<ref>''[[Charles Gavan Duffy]]: Conversations With Carlyle (1892), with Introduction, Stray Thoughts on Young Ireland'', Brendan Clifford, Athol Books, Belfast, {{ISBN|0-85034-114-0}}.pg 17 &21</ref>\n\nPolitically, he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the British Crown. He often warned the British establishment that if they did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the \"counsels of violent men\". Successive British governments continued to ignore this advice, long after his death, although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the Catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted, i.e., eliminating disabilities on Roman Catholics; ensuring that lawfully elected Roman Catholics could serve their constituencies in the British Parliament (until the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was restored); and amending the Oath of Allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to Roman Catholics who could then take the Oath in good conscience.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nAlthough a native speaker of the [[Irish language]], O'Connell encouraged Irish people to learn English to better themselves.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> Although he is best known for the campaign for Catholic emancipation; he also supported similar efforts for Irish Jews. At his insistence, in 1846, the British law \"[[History of the Jews in Ireland#18th and 19th century|De Judaismo]]\", which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed. O'Connell said: \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews\".<ref>[http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html Jewish Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222092245/http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html|date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Campaigning for Catholic emancipation ==\nO'Connell returned to politics in the 1810s. In 1811, he established the Catholic Board, which campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]], that is, the opportunity for Irish Catholics to become members of parliament. In 1823, he set up the [[Catholic Association]] which embraced other aims to better Irish Catholics, such as: electoral reform, reform of the [[Church of Ireland]], tenants' rights, and economic development.<ref>Paul Adelmann and Robert Pearce, ''Great Britain and the Irish Question 1798\u20131922'', Hodder Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-340-88901-2}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month, a minimal amount designed to attract Catholic peasants. The subscription was highly successful, and the Association raised a large sum of money in its first year. The money was used to campaign for Catholic emancipation, specifically funding pro-emancipation members of parliament (MPs) standing for the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Geoghegan, Patrick M. (2008). ''King Dan''. Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe Crown moved to suppress the Association by a series of prosecutions, with mixed success. O'Connell was often briefed for the defence, and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of Catholics to argue for emancipation. He clashed repeatedly with [[William Saurin]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and most influential figure in the Dublin administration, and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in pp. 151\u2013179</ref>\n\nIn 1815 a serious event in his life occurred. [[Dublin Corporation]] was considered a stronghold of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and O'Connell, in an 1815 speech, referred to it as a \"beggarly corporation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Millingen|first=John Gideon|title=The history of duelling: including, narratives of the most remarkable personal encounters that have taken place from the earliest period to the present time, Volume 2|year=1841|publisher=R.

The duel had filled [[Dublin Castle]] (from where the [[Dublin Castle administration|British Government administered Ireland]]) with tense excitement at the prospect that O'Connell would be killed. They regarded O'Connell as \"worse than a public nuisance\", and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\">Dennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pp 138\u2013145</ref>\n\nO'Connell met D'Esterre and [[Oughter Ard#Duel|mortally wounded him]] (he was shot in the hip, the bullet then lodging in his stomach), in a duel at [[Oughterard, County Kildare]]. His conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that, not only had he killed a man, but he had left his family almost destitute.<ref>Geoghegan, ''King Dan''  p. 155</ref>\n\nO'Connell offered to \"share his income\" with D'Esterre's widow, but she declined; however, she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O'Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life, and he refused ever to fight another, being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\" />\n\nAs part of his campaign for Catholic emancipation, O'Connell created the Catholic Association in 1823; this organisation acted as a pressure group against the British government so as to achieve emancipation. The [[Catholic Rent]], which was established in 1824 by O'Connell and the Catholic Church raised funds from which O'Connell was able to help finance the Catholic Association in its push for emancipation. Official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation, as shown by the summary dismissal of William Saurin, the Attorney General and a leading opponent of religious toleration, whom O'Connell called \"our mortal foe\".\n\nO'Connell stood in a [[1828 Clare by-election|by-election]] to the British House of Commons in 1828 for [[Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|County Clare]] against [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey Fitzgerald]], who had just joined the British Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. By law at the time, Cabinet office was deemed to be \"an office of profit\" under the Crown, requiring the promoted man to obtain the endorsement of his constituents by standing for re-election.\n\nAfter O'Connell won election, he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], which was incompatible with Catholicism. The Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the [[Home Secretary]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.<ref>Oliver MacDonagh (1991), ''The Life of Daniel O'Connell''</ref>\n\nPeel and Wellington managed to convince [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] that Catholic emancipation and the right of Catholics and [[Presbyterian]]s and members of all Christian faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]] to sit in Parliament needed to be established; with the help of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] became law in 1829.\n\nHowever, the Emancipation Act was not made retroactive, meaning that O'Connell had either to seek re-election or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy. When O'Connell attempted on 15 May to take his seat without taking the oath of supremacy,  Solicitor-General [[Nicholas Conyngham Tindal]] moved that his seat be declared vacant and another election ordered; O'Connell was elected unopposed on 30 July 1829.<ref name=\"Hist Parl\">''[[The History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol VI pp. 535\u2013536.</ref>\n\nHe took his seat when Parliament resumed in February 1830, by which time [[Henry Charles Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk]] and Earl of Surrey, had already become the first Roman Catholic to have taken advantage of the Emancipation Act and sit in Parliament.<ref name=\"Not first\">''[[History of Parliament]] 1820\u20131832'' vol I p. 253.</ref><ref name=\"Not first2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deskeenan.com/1GrChap8.htm|title=The Grail Chapter Eight|work=deskeenan.com}}</ref>\n\n\"Wellington is the King of England\", King George IV once complained, \"O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I am only the dean of Windsor.\" The regal jest expressed the general admiration for O'Connell at the height of his career.\n\nThe Catholic emancipation campaign led by O'Connell served as the precedent and model for the emancipation of [[British Jews]], the subsequent [[Jews Relief Act 1858]] allowing Jewish MPs to omit the words in the [[Oath of Allegiance]] \"and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/enacted|title=Jews Relief Act 1858|work=legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> O'Connell himself was an opponent of the persecution of Jews praising Ireland as the \"only Christian country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=CkULAAAAIAAJ&q=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D&dq=Ireland+has+claims+on+your+ancient+race,+it+is+the+only+country+that+I+know+of+unsullied+by+any+one+act+of+persecution+of+the+Jews%E2%80%9D | title=Transactions - the Jewish Historical Society of England| year=1908}}</ref>\n\n===Comments on emancipation===\n[[Michael Doheny]], in his ''The Felon's Track'', says that the very character of emancipation has assumed an \"exaggerated and false guise\" and that it is an error to call it emancipation. He went on, that it was neither the first nor the last nor even the most important in the concessions, which are entitled to the name of emancipation, and that no one remembered the men whose exertions \"wrung from the reluctant spirit of a far darker time the right of living, of worship, of enjoying property, and exercising the franchise\".<ref name=\"doheny\">Michael Doheny's ''The Felon's Track'', M.

Nonetheless O'Connell rejected [[William Sharman Crawford]]'s call for the complete abolition of tithes in 1838, as he felt he could not embarrass the Whigs (the [[Lichfield House Compact]] secured an alliance between Whigs, radicals and Irish MPs in 1835).<ref name=ste/> In 1838, parliament introduced a {{anchor|Tithe Commutation Act}}Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

They in turn were to pass payment to the authorities. Tithes were thus effectively added to a tenant's rent payment. This partial relief and elimination of the confrontational collections ended the violent aspect of the Tithe War.\n\nFull relief from the tax was not achieved until the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], which disestablished the Church of Ireland, by the [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] government.\n\n\nIn 1841, Daniel O'Connell became the first Roman Catholic [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] since the reign of [[James II of England|James II]], who had been the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Ireland and Scotland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\n==Campaign for repeal of the Union==\n[[Image:The Monster Meeting at Clifden in 1843.png|thumb|''The Monster Meeting at [[Clifden]] in 1843'' by [[Joseph Patrick Haverty]]. O'Connell is depicted in the center addressing the gathered masses.|alt=]]\nOnce Catholic emancipation was achieved, O'Connell campaigned for [[Repeal (Ireland)|repeal]] of the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]], which in 1801 had merged the Parliaments of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. To campaign for repeal, O'Connell set up the [[Repeal Association]]. He argued for the re-creation of an independent Kingdom of Ireland to govern itself, with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] as the Queen of Ireland.\n\nTo push for this, he held a series of \"Monster Meetings\" throughout much of Ireland outside the Protestant and Unionist-dominated province of [[Ulster]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/6/17.html|title=In Favor of the Repeal of the Union by Daniel O'Connell.

These rallies concerned the [[British Government]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], banned one such proposed monster meeting at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], [[County Dublin]], just outside Dublin city in 1843. This move was made after the biggest monster meeting was held at [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]].\n\n[[File:OConnellMonument.JPG|thumb|O'Connell Monument on [[O'Connell Street]] in Dublin]]\n[[Tara, Ireland|Tara]] held great significance to the Irish population as it was the historic seat of the [[High Kings of Ireland]]. Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, when the Irish King [[Brian Boru]] defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of \u00a32,000, although he was released after three months by the [[House of Lords]], which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, O'Connell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the Repeal Association.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nO'Connell's lengthy reliance on [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig party]] support for his policies in the Commons resulted in his tacit assent to the [[First Russell ministry]] that adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] from 1846.\n\n==Feud with Disraeli==\nIn April 1835, misled by inaccurate press reports, O'Connell thought [[Benjamin Disraeli]] had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him:\n\n{{quote|His name shows that he is of Jewish origin. I do not use it as a term of reproach; there are many most respectable Jews. But there are, as in every other people, some of the lowest and most disgusting grade of moral turpitude; and of those I look upon Mr. Disraeli as the worst. He has just the qualities of the impenitent thief on the Cross, and I verily believe, if Mr. Disraeli's family herald were to be examined and his genealogy traced, the same personage would be discovered to be the heir at law of the exalted individual to whom I allude.

Morgan declined, replying that he was not responsible for his father's words.\n\n<br />\n\n== \"Neglectful landlord\" ==\nIn an article written by Thomas Campbell Foster, O'Connell was accused of being one of the worst landlords in Ireland on December 25 1845, the [[London Times]].

He campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]]\u2014including the right for Catholics to sit in the [[Westminster Parliament]], denied for over 100 years\u2014and repeal of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] which combined [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThroughout his career in Irish politics, O'Connell was able to gain a large following among the Irish masses in support of him and his [[Catholic Association]]. O'Connell's main strategy was one of political [[reformism]], working within the parliamentary structures of the British state in Ireland and forming an alliance of convenience with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]]. More radical elements broke with O'Connell to found the [[Young Ireland]] movement.\n\n==Early life==\nO'Connell was born at Carhan near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]], to the [[O'Connells of Derrynane]], a wealthy Roman Catholic family  that had been dispossessed of its lands. His parents were Morgan O'Connell  and Catherine O'Mullane. Among his uncles was [[Daniel Charles, Count O'Connell]], an officer in the Irish Brigades of the [[French Army]].  A famous aunt was [[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]], while [[Sir James O'Connell, 1st Baronet]], was his younger brother.  Under the patronage of his wealthy bachelor uncle [[Maurice O'Connell (Hunting Cap)|Maurice \"Hunting Cap\" O'Connell]]. O'Connell was first sent with his brother Maurice to Reddington Academy at Long Island, near Queenstown (Cobh)<ref>J. J. Fr. Harrington's Reddington Academy Walterstown (Baile Ualtair) is a townland in Cobh Rural ED, in Templerobin Civil Parish, in Barony, in Co. Cork, Ireland. O'Kelly \"O'Connell Calling: the Liberator\u2019s place in the world\" (Kerryman, 1949)</ref> They both studied at [[Douai]] in France from 1790 and O'Connell was admitted as a [[barrister]] to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1794, transferring to [[Dublin]]'s [[King's Inns]] two years later. In his early years, he became acquainted with the pro-democracy radicals of the time and committed himself to bringing equal rights and religious tolerance to his own country.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\">{{cite book | last = Boylan | first = Henry | year = 1998 | title = A Dictionary of Irish Biography | edition = 3rd | page = 306 | location = Dublin | publisher = Gill and MacMillan | isbn = 0-7171-2945-4 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:O'Connells Home At Derrynane Abby.JPG|thumb|left|O'Connell's home at [[Derrynane House|Derrynane]]]]\nWhile in Dublin studying for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions not to become involved in any militia activity. When [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]]'s [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion fleet]] entered [[Bantry Bay]] in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement.<ref name=\"Gywnn\">\nDennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pg 71</ref> Dennis Gwynn in his ''Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator'' suggests that the unsettlement was because he was enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people\u2014of which he was one.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" /> He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nAs a law student, O'Connell was aware of his own talents, but the higher ranks of the Bar were closed to him. He read the ''[[Jockey Club]]'' as a picture of the governing class in England and was persuaded by it that, \"vice reigns triumphant in the English court at this day. The spirit of [[liberty]] shrinks to protect property from the attacks of French innovators. The corrupt higher orders tremble for their vicious enjoyments.\"<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nO'Connell's studies at the time had concentrated upon the legal and political history of Ireland, and the debates of the Historical Society concerned the records of governments, and from this he was to conclude, according to one of his biographers, \"in Ireland the whole policy of the Government was to repress the people and to maintain the ascendancy of a privileged and corrupt minority\".<ref name=\"Gywnn\" />\n\nOn 3 January 1797, in an atmosphere of alarm over the French invasion fleet in Bantry Bay, he wrote to his uncle saying that he was the last of his colleagues to join a volunteer corps and \"being young, active, healthy and single\" he could offer no plausible excuse.<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 24a</ref> Later that month, for the sake of expediency, he joined the Lawyers' Artillery Corps.<ref>O'Ferrall, F., ''Daniel O'Connell, Dublin'', 1981, p. 12</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 1798, O'Connell was called to the [[Irish Bar]] and became a [[barrister]]. Four days later, the [[Society of the United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] staged their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] which was put down by the British with great bloodshed. O'Connell did not support the rebellion; he believed that the Irish would have to assert themselves politically rather than by force.\n\nHe went on the [[Munster]] circuit, and for over a decade, he went into a fairly quiet period of private law practice in the south of Ireland.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was reputed to have the largest income of any Irish barrister but, due to natural extravagance and a growing family, was usually in debt; his brother remarked caustically that Daniel was in debt all his life from the age of seventeen. Although he was ultimately to inherit Derrynane from his uncle Maurice, the old man lived to be almost 100 and in the event Daniel's inheritance did not cover his debts.\n\nHe also condemned [[Robert Emmet]]'s [[Irish Rebellion of 1803|Rebellion of 1803]]. Of Emmet, a Protestant, he wrote: \"A man who could coolly prepare so much bloodshed, so many murders\u2014and such horrors of every kind has ceased to be an object of compassion.\"<ref>O'Connell Correspondence, Vol I, Letter No. 97</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to the use of violence, he was willing to defend those accused of political crimes, particularly if he suspected that they had been falsely accused, as in the [[Doneraile]] conspiracy trials of 1829, his last notable court appearance. He was noted for his fearlessness in court: if he thought poorly of a judge (as was very often the case) he had no hesitation in making this clear. Most famous perhaps was his retort to [[James McClelland (Solicitor-General)|Baron McClelland]], who had said that as a barrister he would never have taken the course O'Connell had adopted: O'Connell said that McClelland had never been his model as a barrister, neither would he take directions from him as a judge.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in, Sean (1936). ''King of the Beggars: a life of Daniel O'Connell''. Alan Figgis reissue, p. 97</ref> He did not lack the ambition to become a judge himself: in particular he was attracted by the position of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], yet although he was offered it more than once, finally refused.\n\n==Family==\n[[File:Mary O'Connell.tif|thumb| 1836 Portrait of Mary O'Connell by John Gubbins]]\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell.png|thumb|left|Daniel O'Connell, in an 1836 watercolour by Bernard Mulrenin. <!--''Daniel O'Connell'', 1836, by [[Bernard Mulrenin]]-->]]\n[[File:St Patricks Cathedral (Daniel O'Connell Statue).jpg|thumb|Statue of Daniel O'Connell outside [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]]|alt=]]In 1802 O'Connell married his third cousin, [[Mary O'Connell (1778-1836)|Mary O'Connell]]. It was a love marriage, and to persist in it was an act of considerable courage, since Daniel's uncle Maurice was outraged (as Mary had no fortune) and for a time threatened to disinherit them.<ref>Geoghegan  ''King Dan''  pp.94\u20137</ref> They had four daughters (three surviving), [[Ellen Bridget O'Connell|Ellen]] (1805\u20131883), Catherine (1808), Elizabeth (1810), and Rickarda (1815) and four sons. The sons\u2014[[Maurice O'Connell (MP)|Maurice]] (1803), [[Morgan O'Connell|Morgan]]  (1804), [[John O'Connell (MP)|John]] (1810), and [[Daniel O'Connell Jnr|Daniel]] (1816)\u2014all sat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The marriage was happy and Mary's death in 1837 was a blow from which her husband never fully recovered. He was a devoted father; O'Faol\u00e1in suggests that despite his wide acquaintance he had few close friends and therefore the family circle meant a great deal to him.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in p.87</ref>\n\n=== O'Connell's Ale and connection with the 'licensed trade' ===\nO'Connell assisted his younger son, Daniel junior, to acquire the Phoenix Brewery in James's Street, Dublin in 1831.<ref>''Irish Whiskey: A 1000 Year Tradition'', Malachy Magee, O'Brien Press, Dublin, {{ISBN|0-86278-228-7}}. pg 68\u201374.</ref> The brewery produced a brand known as \"O'Connell's Ale\" and enjoyed some popularity. By 1832, O'Connell was forced to state that he would not be a political patron of the brewing trade or his son's company, until he was no longer a member of parliament, particularly because O'Connell and [[Arthur Guinness]] were political enemies. Guinness was the \"moderate\" liberal candidate, O'Connell was the \"radical\" liberal candidate. The rivalry caused dozens of Irish firms to boycott Guinness during the 1841 Repeal election. It was at this time that Guinness was accused of supporting the \"Orange system\", and its beer was known as \"Protestant porter\". When the O'Connell family left brewing, the rights to \"O'Connell Dublin Ale\" was sold to John D'Arcy. The brewing business proved to be unsuccessful though, and after a few years was taken over by the manager, John Brennan, while Daniel junior embraced a political career. Brennan changed the name back to the Phoenix Brewery but continued to brew and sell O'Connell's Ale. When the Phoenix Brewery was effectively closed after being absorbed into the Guinness complex in 1909, the brewing of O'Connell's Ale was carried out by John D'Arcy and Son Ltd at the Anchor Brewery in Usher Street. In 1926, D'Arcy's ceased trading and the firm of Watkins, Jameson and Pim carried on the brewing until they too succumbed to the pressures of trying to compete with Guinness.<ref>T. Halpin: History of the Irish Brewing Industry, 1988</ref><ref name=\"sim\">[http://www.simtec.us/dublinbrewing/history.html History of Brewing in Dublin]</ref>\n\nDaniel junior was the committee chairman of the licensed trade association of the period and gave considerable and valuable support to Daniel O'Connell in his public life. Some time later a quarrel arose and O'Connell turned his back on the association and became a strong advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]]. During the period of [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Fr. Mathew]]'s total abstinence crusades many temperance rallies were held, the most notable being a huge rally held on [[St. Patrick's Day]] in 1841. Daniel O'Connell was a guest of honour at another such rally held at the [[Rotunda Hospital]].<ref name=\"sim\" /><ref>St Martin Magazine (ISSN 1393-1008), June 2003 St Martin Apostolate, Dublin</ref>\n\n== Political beliefs and programme ==\n[[File:Daniel O'Connell2.jpg|thumb|\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\" poster published in [[Pennsylvania]], 1847]]\n\nA critic of violent insurrection ''in Ireland'', O'Connell once said that \"the altar of liberty totters when it is cemented only with blood\", and yet as late as 1841, O'Connell had whipped his MPs into line to keep the [[First Opium War|(First) Opium War]] going in China. The Tories at the time had proposed a motion of censure over the war, and O'Connell had to call upon his MPs to support the Whig Government. As a result of this intervention, the Government was saved.<ref>''[[Charles Gavan Duffy]]: Conversations With Carlyle (1892), with Introduction, Stray Thoughts on Young Ireland'', Brendan Clifford, Athol Books, Belfast, {{ISBN|0-85034-114-0}}.pg 17 &21</ref>\n\nPolitically, he focused on parliamentary and populist methods to force change and made regular declarations of his loyalty to the British Crown. He often warned the British establishment that if they did not reform the governance of Ireland, Irishmen would start to listen to the \"counsels of violent men\". Successive British governments continued to ignore this advice, long after his death, although he succeeded in extracting by the sheer force of will and the power of the Catholic peasants and clergy much of what he wanted, i.e., eliminating disabilities on Roman Catholics; ensuring that lawfully elected Roman Catholics could serve their constituencies in the British Parliament (until the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] was restored); and amending the Oath of Allegiance so as to remove clauses offensive to Roman Catholics who could then take the Oath in good conscience.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nAlthough a native speaker of the [[Irish language]], O'Connell encouraged Irish people to learn English to better themselves.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> Although he is best known for the campaign for Catholic emancipation; he also supported similar efforts for Irish Jews. At his insistence, in 1846, the British law \"[[History of the Jews in Ireland#18th and 19th century|De Judaismo]]\", which prescribed a special dress for Jews, was repealed. O'Connell said: \"Ireland has claims on your ancient race, it is the only country that I know of unsullied by any one act of persecution of the Jews\".<ref>[http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html Jewish Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222092245/http://www.jewishireland.org/history_2.html|date=22 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Campaigning for Catholic emancipation ==\nO'Connell returned to politics in the 1810s. In 1811, he established the Catholic Board, which campaigned for [[Catholic emancipation]], that is, the opportunity for Irish Catholics to become members of parliament. In 1823, he set up the [[Catholic Association]] which embraced other aims to better Irish Catholics, such as: electoral reform, reform of the [[Church of Ireland]], tenants' rights, and economic development.<ref>Paul Adelmann and Robert Pearce, ''Great Britain and the Irish Question 1798\u20131922'', Hodder Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-340-88901-2}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Association was funded by membership dues of one penny per month, a minimal amount designed to attract Catholic peasants. The subscription was highly successful, and the Association raised a large sum of money in its first year. The money was used to campaign for Catholic emancipation, specifically funding pro-emancipation members of parliament (MPs) standing for the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Geoghegan, Patrick M. (2008). ''King Dan''. Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, p. 168</ref>\n\nThe Crown moved to suppress the Association by a series of prosecutions, with mixed success. O'Connell was often briefed for the defence, and showed extraordinary vigour in pleading the rights of Catholics to argue for emancipation. He clashed repeatedly with [[William Saurin]], the [[Attorney General for Ireland]] and most influential figure in the Dublin administration, and political differences between the two men were fuelled by a bitter personal antipathy.<ref>O'Faol\u00e1in pp. 151\u2013179</ref>\n\nIn 1815 a serious event in his life occurred. [[Dublin Corporation]] was considered a stronghold of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and O'Connell, in an 1815 speech, referred to it as a \"beggarly corporation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Millingen|first=John Gideon|title=The history of duelling: including, narratives of the most remarkable personal encounters that have taken place from the earliest period to the present time, Volume 2|year=1841|publisher=R.

The duel had filled [[Dublin Castle]] (from where the [[Dublin Castle administration|British Government administered Ireland]]) with tense excitement at the prospect that O'Connell would be killed. They regarded O'Connell as \"worse than a public nuisance\", and would have welcomed any prospect of seeing him removed at this time.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\">Dennis Gywnn, ''Daniel O'Connell The Irish Liberator'', Hutchinson & Co. Ltd pp 138\u2013145</ref>\n\nO'Connell met D'Esterre and [[Oughter Ard#Duel|mortally wounded him]] (he was shot in the hip, the bullet then lodging in his stomach), in a duel at [[Oughterard, County Kildare]]. His conscience was bitterly sore by the fact that, not only had he killed a man, but he had left his family almost destitute.<ref>Geoghegan, ''King Dan''  p. 155</ref>\n\nO'Connell offered to \"share his income\" with D'Esterre's widow, but she declined; however, she consented to accept an allowance for her daughter, which O'Connell regularly paid for more than thirty years until his death. The memory of the duel haunted him for the remainder of his life, and he refused ever to fight another, being prepared to risk accusations of cowardice rather than kill again.<ref name=\"Dennis Gywnn Pg 138-145\" />\n\nAs part of his campaign for Catholic emancipation, O'Connell created the Catholic Association in 1823; this organisation acted as a pressure group against the British government so as to achieve emancipation. The [[Catholic Rent]], which was established in 1824 by O'Connell and the Catholic Church raised funds from which O'Connell was able to help finance the Catholic Association in its push for emancipation. Official opinion was gradually swinging towards emancipation, as shown by the summary dismissal of William Saurin, the Attorney General and a leading opponent of religious toleration, whom O'Connell called \"our mortal foe\".\n\nO'Connell stood in a [[1828 Clare by-election|by-election]] to the British House of Commons in 1828 for [[Clare (UK Parliament constituency)|County Clare]] against [[William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey|William Vesey Fitzgerald]], who had just joined the British Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. By law at the time, Cabinet office was deemed to be \"an office of profit\" under the Crown, requiring the promoted man to obtain the endorsement of his constituents by standing for re-election.\n\nAfter O'Connell won election, he was unable to take his seat as members of parliament had to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]], which was incompatible with Catholicism. The Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and the [[Home Secretary]], Sir [[Robert Peel]], even though they opposed Catholic participation in Parliament, saw that denying O'Connell his seat would cause outrage and could lead to another rebellion or uprising in Ireland, which was about 85% Catholic.<ref>Oliver MacDonagh (1991), ''The Life of Daniel O'Connell''</ref>\n\nPeel and Wellington managed to convince [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] that Catholic emancipation and the right of Catholics and [[Presbyterian]]s and members of all Christian faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]] to sit in Parliament needed to be established; with the help of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] became law in 1829.\n\nHowever, the Emancipation Act was not made retroactive, meaning that O'Connell had either to seek re-election or to attempt to take the oath of supremacy.

Nonetheless O'Connell rejected [[William Sharman Crawford]]'s call for the complete abolition of tithes in 1838, as he felt he could not embarrass the Whigs (the [[Lichfield House Compact]] secured an alliance between Whigs, radicals and Irish MPs in 1835).<ref name=ste/> In 1838, parliament introduced a {{anchor|Tithe Commutation Act}}Tithe Commutation Act for Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, when the Irish King [[Brian Boru]] defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" /> He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of \u00a32,000, although he was released after three months by the [[House of Lords]], which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, O'Connell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the Repeal Association.<ref name=\"Boylan1998\" />\n\nO'Connell's lengthy reliance on [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig party]] support for his policies in the Commons resulted in his tacit assent to the [[First Russell ministry]] that adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] from 1846.\n\n==Feud with Disraeli==\nIn April 1835, misled by inaccurate press reports, O'Connell thought [[Benjamin Disraeli]] had slandered him and launched an outspoken attack upon him:\n\n{{quote|His name shows that he is of Jewish origin.

He was prominent in the affairs of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]] and owner of a prize-winning herd of [[Shorthorn|short-horn]] cattle.  He served as a [[Tory (political faction)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the Riding from 1832 to 1841, after which  he sat in the [[House of Lords]], having succeeded to the title on the death of his father. From 1826 to 1831 he had sat as an [[Ultra-Tory]] MP. He was the first MP to support [[Richard Oastler]]'s campaign for [[Factory Acts|Factory Reform]], and gave it unwavering support for the rest of his life; in 1847 he seconded the Second Reading in the Lords of the Factory Act of that year (the '[[Factories Act 1847|Ten-Hour Act]]').\n\n==Background==\nFeversham was the eldest son of [[Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham|Charles Duncombe]] (subsequently (1826) created Baron Feversham),{{efn|an earlier Duncombe had also been created [[Baron Feversham]] but his line - and therefore that title - had become extinct: Charles was therefore the first baron of the second creation, but was occasionally erroneously (and potentially confusingly) described as the second baron.  There was no connection with the [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Lord Feversham]] who had served [[James II of England|James II]]}} and Lady Charlotte, daughter of [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth]].

I differed from him in respect of the Test acts and on the Catholic Bill. But we have sat in Parliament two years on the same benches, and I declare to you I never saw a man whose conduct did him more honour, or who was more perfectly independent. He has despised place and power, and given an honest and consistent opposition to many of the measures of government, and I can scarcely call to mind one question upon which, during the two years I have mentioned, we have voted on opposite sides.

Unlike the election of 1826 they were not immediately elected: this time a fifth candidate nominated himself and demanded a poll,<ref>{{cite news|title=General Election: Yorkshire Election|work=Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser|date=7 August 1830|page=3}}</ref> The fifth candidate having received a mere handful of votes by the end of the first day of polling, the poll was closed on the second day, at which point Duncombe was third (behind the two Whig candidates).

Usually, the other MP was a Liberal; an 1862 by-election which briefly gave the riding two Conservative MPs saw this analysis from a Liberal newspaper: \"Lord Feversham is a great Parliamentary proprietor. He keeps several seats in the House of Commons, at great expense and with jealous care; and very naturally he does as he will with his own. When one of his Parliamentary saddles is vacant a relative usually has the preference. Three of the favoured family happen just now to be thus mounted. Nobody ever hears of them in the legislative field; but who has any right to ask a question?

He served as a [[Tory (political faction)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the Riding from 1832 to 1841, after which  he sat in the [[House of Lords]], having succeeded to the title on the death of his father.

I differed from him in respect of the Test acts and on the Catholic Bill. But we have sat in Parliament two years on the same benches, and I declare to you I never saw a man whose conduct did him more honour, or who was more perfectly independent. He has despised place and power, and given an honest and consistent opposition to many of the measures of government, and I can scarcely call to mind one question upon which, during the two years I have mentioned, we have voted on opposite sides.

Her career has spanned almost eight decades, much of it in the United States. Her work received international attention.\n\n<!-- Lansbury's life from her birth to ''Mame'' -->\nLansbury was born to Irish actress [[Moyna Macgill]] and English politician [[Edgar Lansbury (politician)|Edgar Lansbury]], an upper-middle-class family in [[Regent's Park]], [[central London]]. To escape [[the Blitz]], in 1940 she moved to the United States with her mother and two brothers, and studied acting in New York City. Proceeding to [[Hollywood]] in 1942, she signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and obtained her first film roles, in ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945), earning her two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award]]. She appeared in eleven further films for MGM, mostly in supporting  roles such as ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944), and ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''. After her contract ended in 1952 she began supplementing her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Although largely seen as a [[B-list]] star during this period, her appearance in the film ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962) received widespread acclaim, was cited as being one of her finest performances and received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] nomination. Moving into musical theatre, Lansbury finally gained stardom for playing the leading role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966), which earned her a range of awards.\n\n<!-- Lansbury's life from the 1970s to the present -->\nAmid difficulties in her personal life, Lansbury moved from [[California]] to [[County Cork]], Ireland in 1970, and continued with her theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout the decade. These included leading roles in the stage musicals ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', and ''[[The King and I]]'', Back in the U.S., moving into television, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth [[Jessica Fletcher]] in the American [[whodunit]] series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', which ran for twelve seasons from 1984 until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running detective drama series in television history. Through [[Corymore Productions]], a company that she co-owned with her husband [[Peter Shaw (producer)|Peter Shaw]], Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. Since then, she has toured in a variety of international theatrical productions and continued to make occasional film appearances in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) and ''[[Mary Poppins Returns]]'' (2018), as well as [[Dame Emma Thompson]]'s ''[[Nanny McPhee]]'' (2005). \n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nLansbury has received an [[Honorary Oscar]] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) and has won five [[Tony Award]]s, six Golden Globes, and an [[Olivier Award]]. She has also been nominated for numerous other industry awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] on three occasions, and various [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s on eighteen occasions, and a [[Grammy Award]]. In 2014, Lansbury was made a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

Brigid Lansbury''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}} (born 16 October 1925) is an English\u2013American actress who has appeared in theatre, television, and film roles. Her career has spanned almost eight decades, much of it in the United States. Her work received international attention.\n\n<!-- Lansbury's life from her birth to ''Mame'' -->\nLansbury was born to Irish actress [[Moyna Macgill]] and English politician [[Edgar Lansbury (politician)|Edgar Lansbury]], an upper-middle-class family in [[Regent's Park]], [[central London]]. To escape [[the Blitz]], in 1940 she moved to the United States with her mother and two brothers, and studied acting in New York City. Proceeding to [[Hollywood]] in 1942, she signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and obtained her first film roles, in ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944) and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)|The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1945), earning her two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award]]. She appeared in eleven further films for MGM, mostly in supporting  roles such as ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944), and ''[[The Harvey Girls]]''. After her contract ended in 1952 she began supplementing her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Although largely seen as a [[B-list]] star during this period, her appearance in the film ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962) received widespread acclaim, was cited as being one of her finest performances and received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] nomination. Moving into musical theatre, Lansbury finally gained stardom for playing the leading role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966), which earned her a range of awards.\n\n<!-- Lansbury's life from the 1970s to the present -->\nAmid difficulties in her personal life, Lansbury moved from [[California]] to [[County Cork]], Ireland in 1970, and continued with her theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout the decade. These included leading roles in the stage musicals ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', and ''[[The King and I]]'', Back in the U.S., moving into television, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth [[Jessica Fletcher]] in the American [[whodunit]] series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', which ran for twelve seasons from 1984 until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running detective drama series in television history. Through [[Corymore Productions]], a company that she co-owned with her husband [[Peter Shaw (producer)|Peter Shaw]], Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. Since then, she has toured in a variety of international theatrical productions and continued to make occasional film appearances in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) and ''[[Mary Poppins Returns]]'' (2018), as well as [[Dame Emma Thompson]]'s ''[[Nanny McPhee]]'' (2005). \n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nLansbury has received an [[Honorary Oscar]] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) and has won five [[Tony Award]]s, six Golden Globes, and an [[Olivier Award]]. She has also been nominated for numerous other industry awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] on three occasions, and various [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s on eighteen occasions, and a [[Grammy Award]]. In 2014, Lansbury was made a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

Set in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, the film was being directed by [[George Cukor]], and starred [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Van Druten suggested that Lansbury would be perfect for the role of Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set.

{"title_page": "Thomas Slingsby Duncombe", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:Portrait of Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, Esq (4670625) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Engraving of Duncombe, c. 1858]]\n'''Thomas Slingsby Duncombe''' (1796 \u2013 13 November 1861) was a [[Political radicalism|Radical politician]], who was a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for [[Hertford (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertford]] from 1826 to 1832 and for [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury]] from 1834 until his death.  Duncombe was a tireless champion of radical causes in the 27 years he served the North East London borough of Finsbury. But he was equally well known for his style; he was, it was often said, \"the handsomest and best-dressed man in the house,\" and his love for theatre, gaming and women were well publicized. Duncombe was elected and then returned to his seat seven times by the shopkeepers, [[artisan]]s and laborers, the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, [[Catholic]]s, and [[Jews]] of Finsbury, making him the longest-sitting representative of a metropolitan borough in his day. His constituents called him \"Honest Tom Duncombe\" with great affection; to his detractors he was known as the \"Dandy Demagogue\" or the \"Radical Dandy\". His name was celebrated in working men's newspapers and frequently mentioned in the gossip sheets of high society. Duncombe was, as ''[[The Times]]'' put it delicately upon his death, a \"character\".\n\n== Life and career ==\nDuncombe was born wealthy and well-connected in 1796 in [[Middlesex]]. His parents, Thomas and Emma Duncombe, had an estate in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. He was the grandson (on his mother's side) to the [[Bishop]] of [[Peterborough]], and nephew to the first Baron Feversham. He attended [[Harrow school]] from 1808 to 1811, leaving to take up a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] in the elite regiment of the [[Coldstream Guards]]. While in the Guards, Duncombe served as aide-de-camp to General Sir [[Ronald Ferguson]]. As Ferguson was well known for supporting the ballot and other political reforms during his time in Parliament, it is likely that it was here that Duncombe had his first political awakening as a radical. After being raised to the rank of [[Lieutenant]], Duncombe resigned from the army in 1819.\n\n=== Early service in Parliament ===\nIn 1820, Duncombe ran for Parliament for [[Pontefract]] as a [[British Whig Party|Whig]] candidate. He lost. In 1823, he ran again as a Whig for [[Hertford]] and was again unsuccessful. In June 1826, Duncombe finally won a seat in Parliament for Hertford. He enjoyed a great success in the Commons with two early speeches in which he vigorously attacked the Government. According to [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Greville]], however, he had merely committed to heart and rehearsed speeches which had been prepared for him by [[Henry FitzGerald-de Ros, 22nd Baron de Ros|Henry de Ros]]. Greville noted caustically in his diary for 25 February 1828:<ref>Charles C. F. Greville, ''A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV'', volume I (Longmans Green & Co, London, 1874), at page 130</ref>\n<blockquote>\u201cAnd what are the agents who have produced such an effect? A man of ruined fortune and doubtful character, whose life has been spent on the race-course, at the gaming-table, and in the green-room, of limited capacity, exceedingly ignorant, and without any stock but his impudence to trade on, only speaking to serve an electioneering purpose, and crammed by another with every thought and every word that he uttered.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nDuncombe was returned in 1830 and again in 1831. Over the course of these contests he spent an estimated \u00a340,000; a fact he later frankly admitted in pressing the case for political reforms. Outspent by his rival, the Tory [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquis of Salisbury]], Duncombe lost his seat in 1832. Outmanoeuvring Salisbury, Duncombe challenged the election on grounds of bribery and had it declared void.\n\nAs a representative for Hertford he was an early supporter of political reform, though made little lasting impression in Parliament. He made more of an impression in society where he built a reputation as a [[dandy]], a [[rake (character)|rake]], a theatre supporter, and one of the best gentleman horseriders in England. He was close friends with [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count D'Orsay|Count D'Orsay]], who sketched a portrait of his \"cher Tomie\" that still resides in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]][http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp01388&rNo=1&role=sit]. For a time \"Tommy\" was attached to [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]], the famed actress and later lessee of the [[Olympic Theatre]]. [[Marguerite, Countess of Blessington|Lady Blessington]] used him as a model for the hero of one of her novels and the novelist-cum-[[Prime Minister]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], recalled that his friend Duncombe was later to be his resource on [[Chartism]] for ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil: or The Two Nations]]''.\n\n===Radical for Finsbury ===\nThe [[Reform Act]] of 1832 created new metropolitan boroughs that needed representation. In 1834, Duncombe won a seat representing the new North East London borough of Finsbury \u2013 spending less than \u00a316 to do so. In his acceptance speech he laid out his increasingly independent and Radical politics: promising to fight for religious liberty and an end to church rates and sinecures, reform of taxation and modernizing the economy, and the ballot, the franchise and triennial parliamentary terms; the core principles of what would become the [[People's Charter of 1838|People's Charter]] of [[Chartism]] four years later. Indeed, Duncombe was to introduce the second petition for the People's Charter to Parliament in 1842. Signed by more than 3.3 million people, the petition had to be unrolled to fit through the doors of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\nAs Radical MP for Finsbury, Duncombe became increasingly outspoken. He sought to obtain the release of [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]] and other Chartists. He campaigned against the new [[Poor Law]] and other \"reforms\" of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. He exposed conditions in [[prison hulk]]s and the treatment of the insane. He exposed the practice of the [[Home Office]] opening the mail of political dissidents such as the Italian [[Mazzini]] and, as it was later revealed, himself. And, taking on an issue particularly dear, he chaired a committee that examined \u2013 and ridiculed \u2013 the power of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]\u2019s office to censor and restrict the theatre. He also took up the cause of religious Dissenters, Catholics and Jews, including the claim of Baron [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] to take his seat in Parliament, and was a particular advocate of [[Jewish emancipation]], spending the last years of his life helping edit a book on ''The Jews of England: Their History and Wrongs''.\n\n=== Radical at large ===\nOutside Parliament Duncombe worked to support working men and women. He chaired the national conference of trades in 1845 and helped organize the [[National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Labour]] (NAUT), serving as the body\u2019s president for seven years. Duncombe was a frequent speaker at [[trade union]] functions, and came out in public support of a number of strikes. The enigmatic radical was also equally at home in the green rooms of theatres and the gambling halls of exclusive clubs like Crockford's and [[Almack's]] where he ran up debts to the astounding amount of \u00a3120,000 \u2013 \u00a3140,000 (in excess of \u00a38 million in 2006 pounds) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080119001130/http://www.measuringworth.com/index.html]. His creditors had him arrested in 1847 and he was heavily criticized for using parliamentary privilege to escape punishment. Indeed, his critics accused Duncombe of using an earlier trip to [[Canada]] to support his friend and political patron [[John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] as a ruse to escape his debts.\n\n=== Performative politics ===\nEven his critics \u2013 of which he had many \u2013 had to admit that as a debater Duncombe was one of the best in the House of Commons. His jocular manner disarmed his opponents and charmed his supporters. His polemical speaking style, and [[sartorial]] dressing style, was even parodied by [[Charles Dickens]] in a brief sketch in ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]''. Exhibiting a new style of politics, Duncombe performed not only for the politicians assembled in the House but for \"the people out of doors,\" as the public were then called. In spite of his dandified affectations, or perhaps \u2013 given the growing popularity of commercial spectacles like the sights of the [[Vauxhall]] and [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne]] pleasure gardens and the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 partly because of his colorful performance, he was immensely popular with the public. His open embrace of pleasure, his sartorial style and the perceived and real excesses of his personal life, far from being the distraction from politics as his critics frequently commented, may actually have been an integral asset to his popularity.\n\n=== Sickness and death ===\nDuncombe was plagued by a [[bronchial]] condition that would eventually kill him. Between 1847 and 1850 he was often too sick to attend Parliament regularly. But when he could he did, and gaunt and emaciated, this dandified child of privilege continued to stand up in the House for the rights of the less visible and less fortunate, and chair the long and arduous meetings of trade unionists.\n\nIn 1856, already ill, he championed the case of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] revolutionary exile [[Istv\u00e1n T\u00fcrr]], arrested by the [[Austria]]n authorities and in concrete danger of being executed, and helped push the British government to intervene and get him freed.\n\nDuncombe died at the age of 65 in [[Sussex]], and a week later he was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in London.\n\n==Books by Duncombe==\n*Duncombe, Thomas Slingsby and James Acland, ''The Jews of England: Their History and Wrongs'' (London: J.

Duncombe was a tireless champion of radical causes in the 27 years he served the North East London borough of Finsbury. But he was equally well known for his style; he was, it was often said, \"the handsomest and best-dressed man in the house,\" and his love for theatre, gaming and women were well publicized. Duncombe was elected and then returned to his seat seven times by the shopkeepers, [[artisan]]s and laborers, the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, [[Catholic]]s, and [[Jews]] of Finsbury, making him the longest-sitting representative of a metropolitan borough in his day. His constituents called him \"Honest Tom Duncombe\" with great affection; to his detractors he was known as the \"Dandy Demagogue\" or the \"Radical Dandy\". His name was celebrated in working men\u2019s newspapers and frequently mentioned in the gossip sheets of high society. Duncombe was, as ''[[The Times]]'' put it delicately upon his death, a \"character\".\n\n== Life and career ==\nDuncombe was born wealthy and well-connected in 1796 in [[Middlesex]]. His parents, Thomas and Emma Duncombe, had an estate in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. He was the grandson (on his mother's side) to the [[Bishop]] of [[Peterborough]], and nephew to the first Baron Feversham. He attended [[Harrow school]] from 1808 to 1811, leaving to take up a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] in the elite regiment of the [[Coldstream Guards]]. While in the Guards, Duncombe served as aide-de-camp to General Sir [[Ronald Ferguson]]. As Ferguson was well known for supporting the ballot and other political reforms during his time in Parliament, it is likely that it was here that Duncombe had his first political awakening as a radical. After being raised to the rank of [[Lieutenant]], Duncombe resigned from the army in 1819.\n\n=== Early service in Parliament ===\nIn 1820, Duncombe ran for Parliament for [[Pontefract]] as a [[British Whig Party|Whig]] candidate. He lost. In 1823, he ran again as a Whig for [[Hertford]] and was again unsuccessful. In June 1826, Duncombe finally won a seat in Parliament for Hertford. He enjoyed a great success in the Commons with two early speeches in which he vigorously attacked the Government. According to [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Greville]], however, he had merely committed to heart and rehearsed speeches which had been prepared for him by [[Henry FitzGerald-de Ros, 22nd Baron de Ros|Henry de Ros]]. Greville noted caustically in his diary for 25 February 1828:<ref>Charles C. F. Greville, ''A Journal of the Reigns of King George IV and King William IV'', volume I (Longmans Green & Co, London, 1874), at page 130</ref>\n<blockquote>\u201cAnd what are the agents who have produced such an effect? A man of ruined fortune and doubtful character, whose life has been spent on the race-course, at the gaming-table, and in the green-room, of limited capacity, exceedingly ignorant, and without any stock but his impudence to trade on, only speaking to serve an electioneering purpose, and crammed by another with every thought and every word that he uttered.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nDuncombe was returned in 1830 and again in 1831. Over the course of these contests he spent an estimated \u00a340,000; a fact he later frankly admitted in pressing the case for political reforms. Outspent by his rival, the Tory [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquis of Salisbury]], Duncombe lost his seat in 1832. Outmanoeuvring Salisbury, Duncombe challenged the election on grounds of bribery and had it declared void.\n\nAs a representative for Hertford he was an early supporter of political reform, though made little lasting impression in Parliament. He made more of an impression in society where he built a reputation as a [[dandy]], a [[rake (character)|rake]], a theatre supporter, and one of the best gentleman horseriders in England. He was close friends with [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count D'Orsay|Count D'Orsay]], who sketched a portrait of his \"cher Tomie\" that still resides in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]][http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp01388&rNo=1&role=sit]. For a time \"Tommy\" was attached to [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]], the famed actress and later lessee of the [[Olympic Theatre]]. [[Marguerite, Countess of Blessington|Lady Blessington]] used him as a model for the hero of one of her novels and the novelist-cum-[[Prime Minister]], [[Benjamin Disraeli]], recalled that his friend Duncombe was later to be his resource on [[Chartism]] for ''[[Sybil (novel)|Sybil: or The Two Nations]]''.\n\n===Radical for Finsbury ===\nThe [[Reform Act]] of 1832 created new metropolitan boroughs that needed representation. In 1834, Duncombe won a seat representing the new North East London borough of Finsbury \u2013 spending less than \u00a316 to do so. In his acceptance speech he laid out his increasingly independent and Radical politics: promising to fight for religious liberty and an end to church rates and sinecures, reform of taxation and modernizing the economy, and the ballot, the franchise and triennial parliamentary terms; the core principles of what would become the [[People's Charter of 1838|People's Charter]] of [[Chartism]] four years later. Indeed, Duncombe was to introduce the second petition for the People's Charter to Parliament in 1842. Signed by more than 3.3 million people, the petition had to be unrolled to fit through the doors of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\nAs Radical MP for Finsbury, Duncombe became increasingly outspoken. He sought to obtain the release of [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]] and other Chartists. He campaigned against the new [[Poor Law]] and other \"reforms\" of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. He exposed conditions in [[prison hulk]]s and the treatment of the insane. He exposed the practice of the [[Home Office]] opening the mail of political dissidents such as the Italian [[Mazzini]] and, as it was later revealed, himself. And, taking on an issue particularly dear, he chaired a committee that examined \u2013 and ridiculed \u2013 the power of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]\u2019s office to censor and restrict the theatre. He also took up the cause of religious Dissenters, Catholics and Jews, including the claim of Baron [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] to take his seat in Parliament, and was a particular advocate of [[Jewish emancipation]], spending the last years of his life helping edit a book on ''The Jews of England: Their History and Wrongs''.\n\n=== Radical at large ===\nOutside Parliament Duncombe worked to support working men and women. He chaired the national conference of trades in 1845 and helped organize the [[National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Labour]] (NAUT), serving as the body\u2019s president for seven years. Duncombe was a frequent speaker at [[trade union]] functions, and came out in public support of a number of strikes. The enigmatic radical was also equally at home in the green rooms of theatres and the gambling halls of exclusive clubs like Crockford's and [[Almack's]] where he ran up debts to the astounding amount of \u00a3120,000 \u2013 \u00a3140,000 (in excess of \u00a38 million in 2006 pounds) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080119001130/http://www.measuringworth.com/index.html]. His creditors had him arrested in 1847 and he was heavily criticized for using parliamentary privilege to escape punishment. Indeed, his critics accused Duncombe of using an earlier trip to [[Canada]] to support his friend and political patron [[John George Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] as a ruse to escape his debts.\n\n=== Performative politics ===\nEven his critics \u2013 of which he had many \u2013 had to admit that as a debater Duncombe was one of the best in the House of Commons.

Exhibiting a new style of politics, Duncombe performed not only for the politicians assembled in the House but for \"the people out of doors,\" as the public were then called. In spite of his dandified affectations, or perhaps \u2013 given the growing popularity of commercial spectacles like the sights of the [[Vauxhall]] and [[Cremorne Gardens, London|Cremorne]] pleasure gardens and the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 partly because of his colorful performance, he was immensely popular with the public.

He is best known for a spoken-word record called \"An Open Letter to My Teenage Son\", which became an unlikely [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[hit record|hit]] in 1967.<ref>''\"USA's Hottest New 45 RPM: Letter To A Teenage Son\"'' by Bob O'Lear [[Rolling Stone]]. #RS2 November 23, 1967.</ref>\n\nLundberg was born in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]] and was a newscaster at Grand Rapids [[radio station]] [[WGVU (AM)|WMAX]] when he released \"An Open Letter\" in September 1967.  The lyrics, written by Robert R Thompson and produced by Jack Tracy, imagine the narrator talking to his teenage son.  (In real life, Lundberg had at least one male teenager in his household at the time.)  Lundberg touches on [[hippies]], the [[Vietnam War]], and [[patriotism]].  The voice-over, spoken over \"[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\", after empathizing, somewhat, with a number of the typical teenage concerns of the day, turns more conservative and memorably ends with Lundberg telling his son that, if the teen [[Draft-card burning|burns]] his [[draft card]], then he should \"burn [his] [[birth certificate]] at the same time.  From that moment on, I have no son.\"\n\n==Hit record==\n\"An Open Letter\" became a hit in Michigan and was released nationally by [[Liberty Records]], jumping onto the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at #84 on November 11, 1967.  Within three weeks the [[gramophone record|record]] went #58 - #18 - #10, making it one of the dozen or so fastest-climbing records in Hot 100 history up to that point, and Lundberg made an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on November 12, 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-ed-sullivan-show/november-12-1967-the-turtles-johnny-mathis-joan-rivers-shelley-berman-108939/|title=The Ed Sullivan Show, Season 20, Episode 10|date=1967-11-12|accessdate=2019-12-23}}</ref>  After another week at #10, the record slipped to #22 for the week ending December 16, 1967, then vanished from the Hot 100 completely, after a total run of just six weeks.

The lyrics, written by Robert R Thompson and produced by Jack Tracy, imagine the narrator talking to his teenage son.  (In real life, Lundberg had at least one male teenager in his household at the time.)  Lundberg touches on [[hippies]], the [[Vietnam War]], and [[patriotism]].  The voice-over, spoken over \"[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\", after empathizing, somewhat, with a number of the typical teenage concerns of the day, turns more conservative and memorably ends with Lundberg telling his son that, if the teen burns his [[draft card]], then he should \"burn [his] [[birth certificate]] at the same time.  From that moment on, I have no son.\"\n\n==Hit record==\n\"An Open Letter\" became a hit in Michigan and was released nationally by [[Liberty Records]], jumping onto the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at #84 on November 11, 1967.  Within three weeks the [[gramophone record|record]] went #58 - #18 - #10, making it one of the dozen or so fastest-climbing records in Hot 100 history up to that point, and Lundberg made an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on November 12, 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-ed-sullivan-show/november-12-1967-the-turtles-johnny-mathis-joan-rivers-shelley-berman-108939/|title=The Ed Sullivan Show, Season 20, Episode 10|date=1967-11-12|accessdate=2019-12-23}}</ref>  After another week at #10, the record slipped to #22 for the week ending December 16, 1967, then vanished from the Hot 100 completely, after a total run of just six weeks.

About 1785, Williams became chief agent of  copper mines owned partly by the [[Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge (second creation)|earl of Uxbridge]] and partly by the family of Llysdulas; for a time both parties entrusted the management to Williams alone. He was closely associated with the Uxbridge family and helped several sons get elected to Parliament. In 1790, probably with help from the earl of Uxbridge, he was elected for [[Great Marlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Marlow]], and held the seat till his death on 30 November 1802. (The seat was won in 1820 by his grandson and retained until 1868).

Due to the superior rate of climb, vertical maneuverability, thrust to weight ratio and service ceiling the Fresco pilots did not perceive any danger in doing this as they were unaware of this newly installed armament. Sabre pilots began to fire their missiles at the MiG's destroying some. Others broke into a dive and entered a horizontal turning engagement with their pursuers who held an advantage in horizontal turn-rate allowing them to engage with guns shooting down more of the PRC jets. Pilots Jing-Chuen Chen, Chun-Hsein Fu, Jie-Tsu Hsia, Shu-Yuen Li, Ta-Peng Ma, Hong-Yan Sung shot down one MiG-17 each, Yi-Chiang Chien shot down two himself and two pairs of pilots Tasi-Chuen Liu with Tang Jie-Min and Hsin-Yung Wang with Yuen-Po Wang shared in the downing of one MiG by each duo. During this engagement one further Fresco sustained notable damage being impacted by an AIM-9 that did not detonate. It escaped with an intact missile within the airframe that was extracted after returning to its base and hesitantly transferred to the Soviet Union for reverse engineering.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewarbirds.org/missiles/aim9sidewinder.shtml|title=Raytheon AIM-9 Sidewinder|website=www.ewarbirds.org|access-date=2018-12-31}}</ref>\n*[[File:National Emblem of the Republic of China.svg|20x20px|Roundel of Turkey.svg]] 2 October 1958 \u2013 Antiaircraft fire from [[Kinmen]] knocks down a [[Curtiss C-46 Commando|C-46 Commando]] killing all five crewmen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[File:National Emblem of the Republic of China.svg|20x20px|Roundel of Turkey.svg]]'''/'''[[File:Roundel of China.svg|25x25px|Roundel of the USAF]] ('''4''') 10 October 1958 \u2013 Over the PRC four RoCAF F-86F Sabre Pilots engage and shoot down four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17 ''\"Frescos\"'']] of the PLAAF, As one of the Fresco burn it explodes launching chunks of debris towards and striking one of its attackers causing heavy damage, An RoCAF pilot ejects and is captured and placed in detention until his release on 30 June 1959.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[File:National Emblem of the Republic of China.svg|20x20px|Roundel of Turkey.svg]] 29 May 1959 \u2013 Above [[Guangdong|Guandong]] a PLAAF [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17 ''\"Fresco\"'']] intercepts and shoots down a RoCAF [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] killing all 14 on board.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[File:Roundel of China.svg|25x25px|Roundel of the USAF]] ('''2''') 5 July 1959 \u2013 Above the Taiwan Straits twenty four PLAAF [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17 ''\"Frescos\"'']] are engaged by four [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabres]] of the RoCAF ending in the destruction of two Frescos.\n*[[File:National Emblem of the Republic of China.svg|20x20px|Roundel of Turkey.svg]] 7 October 1959 \u2013 Above [[Beijing]] an RoCAF [[RB-57D]] piloted by Wang Ying Chin is the first plane to ever be shot down by a surface to air missile.

His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nOn the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nTwo F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.\n\nUSAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s\nOn the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.\n\nUSAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1\nOn the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nTwo IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.\n\nUSAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.\n\nIRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G\nAn Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.\n\n19 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nIn a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s\nTwo F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground \u2013 he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nRAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29\nIt has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nTwo F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.\n\n24 January 1991\nRSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nThe Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.\n\n26 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s\nIn what is considered a textbook \"beyond visual range\" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase. One of them turned back with mechanical problems, however the other three pressed on. Four F-15Cs were flying when AWACS reported the MiGs. The four F-15s lined up, were assigned targets and fired AIM-7 missiles at all of them, destroying all three MiGs within seconds of each other. Only three of the F-15C pilots were granted kills, as the fourth missile didn't reach the MiG until after it had already been brought down.\n\n27 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s and Mirage F1\nTwo F-15Cs managed to get kills on three MiG-23s and one Mirage F1, after they caught them trying to flee to Iran.

His wingman scored another kill on a third Mirage F1, for a total of three kills in the dogfight.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nOn the first night of the war, two F/A-18s from the carrier USS Saratoga were flying outside of Baghdad when two Iraqi MiG-25PDs interceptors from the 96th Squadron engaged them. In the beyond-visual-range (BVR), one of the Iraqi MiGs, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Zuhair Dawood, fired an R-40 missile, shooting down one of the F/A-18's as it was travelling Mach 0.92. The pilot, Lieutenant Commander [[Scott Speicher]], was killed. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.\n\nUSN F/A-18s vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nTwo F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.\n\nUSAF F-15Es vs IRAF MiG-29s\nOn the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.\n\nUSAF EF-111 vs. IRAF Mirage F-1\nOn the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nTwo IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s). The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them. A total of 10 missiles were fired at the MiGs.\n\nUSAF F-111s vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn Iraqi MiG-23 fired a R-24T missile at a F-111 on a bombing run and scored a hit, although the bomber made it safely back to base. Another similar incident occurred with the same Iraqi interceptor several minutes later, this F-111 also made it back to base despite the severe damage to the aircraft. This is Iraq's only success of the Persian Gulf War using MiG-23s.\n\nIRAF MiG-29 vs USAF F-111 and B-52G\nAn Iraqi MiG-29 struck an F-111 aircraft with an R60 missile, though the sturdy F-111 stayed airworthy. Several minutes later the same pilot fired a R27 missile at a B-52G on a bombing run, severely damaging it.\n\n19 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-25s\nIn a brief dogfight, two F-15Cs engaged and shot down two Iraqi MiG-25s attempting to engage them, both using AIM-7 missiles. One was destroyed by Captain Rick Tuleni and the second by Captain Larry Pitts.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-29s\nTwo F-15Cs, piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez gave chase to a pair of MiG-29s detected by AWACS. The Iraqi aircraft, one piloted by Captain Jameel Sayhood, promptly turned and engaged the two American fighters, and one of the most dramatic dogfights of the Persian Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify the other. Underhill was facing Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself was facing Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, scoring a head-on hit and killing the opposing pilot instantly. Simultaneously, Sayhood gained a lock on Rodriguez, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove to low altitude in order to clutter Sayhood's radar and break the lock-on, and dropped flares to counter his adversary's infra-red search-and-track. However, after seeing his wingman shot down, Sayhood disengaged and fled to the north. Considering the engagement over, Rodriguez and Underhill turned south to rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker in order to refuel, but Sayhood reversed course and set off after them, prompting them to reengage. With the now lone MiG-29 closing head-on with the pair of F-15s, Underhill gained radar lock-on, but did not fire due to a glitch in his IFF interrogator system keeping him from being certain he wasn't about to shoot down a Coalition aircraft. Underhill initially thought he shot down an allied aircraft. Sayhood sliced into the American formation, causing a classic merge. Underhill kept Sayhood locked-on and climbed, while Rodriguez committed to the merge in order to visually identify the opposing aircraft as hostile. As they passed head-on, Rodriguez identified it as an Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on his MiG's better turning radius to get into a firing position on Rodriguez' tail but Rodriguez was very close to firing position on him. Both aircraft lost altitude through the sustained hard turning, bringing them perilously close to the ground. Fearing that Rodriguez would obtain infra-red lock-on and shoot him down with an AIM-9, Sayhood attempted to disengage using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't match Sayhood's manoeuver, and observed him eject just prior to his MiG impacting the ground \u2013 he'd commenced his escape maneuver too low. It was reported years later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg and evacuated to a local hospital.\n\nRAF Tornado GR.1 vs. IRAF MiG-29\nIt has been claimed by some sources that an RAF Tornado (ZA467) crewed by Squadron Leader Gary Lennox and Squadron Leader Adrian Weeks was shot down on 19 January by an R-60MK (NATO reporting name: AA-8 Aphid) missile fired from an Iraqi MiG-29 piloted by Jameel Sayhood, however this aircraft is officially recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nTwo F-15Cs destroyed two Mirage F1s with AIM-7 missiles.\n\n24 January 1991\nRSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mirage F1s\nThe Iraqi Air Force attempted to mount a rare offensive bombing operation and loaded two F1s with incendiary bombs. The Royal Saudi Air Force sent up two F-15Cs to intercept the bombers. One of the F-15s piloted by Captain Ayedh Al-Shamrani maneuvered behind the F1s and shot them both down with AIM-9 missiles.\n\n26 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s\nIn what is considered a textbook \"beyond visual range\" or BVR kill, four MiG-23s took off from an Iraqi airbase. One of them turned back with mechanical problems, however the other three pressed on. Four F-15Cs were flying when AWACS reported the MiGs. The four F-15s lined up, were assigned targets and fired AIM-7 missiles at all of them, destroying all three MiGs within seconds of each other. Only three of the F-15C pilots were granted kills, as the fourth missile didn't reach the MiG until after it had already been brought down.\n\n27 January 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF MiG-23s and Mirage F1\nTwo F-15Cs managed to get kills on three MiG-23s and one Mirage F1, after they caught them trying to flee to Iran. They were brought down with AIM-9 and AIM-7 missiles after a brief dogfight.\n\n29 January 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nAn American F-15C shot down a MiG-23 fleeing to Iran with an AIM-7 missile.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-23\nA USAF F-15C eliminates an Iraqi MiG-23 in a short-lived dogfight with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n2 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF IL-76\nAn F-15C kills an Iraqi transport, an IL-76, that was parked by strafing it with 20&nbsp;mm bullets.\n\n6 February 1991\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF MiG-21s\nA lone F-15C takes down two Iraqi MiG-21s with AIM-7 missiles after they both engage him.

It is the last USN F-14 air-to-air kill.\n\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF Su-22s and Su-7\nTwo USAF F-15Cs shoot down two IRAF Su-22s and one Su-7 as they attempt to flee Iraq. All with AIM-7 missiles.\n\nUSAF F-15C vs. IRAF Mil-24\nA F-15C shoots down an IRAF Mi-24 with an AIM-7 missile.\n\n11 February 1991\nUSAF F-15Cs vs. IRAF helicopters\nTwo F-15Cs shoot down two unidentified Iraqi helicopters by using AIM-7 missiles for both.\n\n14 February 1991\nUSAF F-15E vs. IRAF Hughes 500\nAn F-15E Strike Eagle fighter/bomber dropped a laser-guided bomb onto a Hughes 500 helicopter in the air. The helicopter was on the ground initially loading up commandos, though it took off. Even with it taking off they left the laser on it and the bomb hit it when it was \"200 or so\" feet in the air. A special forces team on the ground witnessed the event.\n\n15 February 1991\nUSAF A-10A vs. IRAF Mi-8\nAn A-10A ground attack aircraft shoots down an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter with its GAU-8 30&nbsp;mm cannon.\n\n===Iraqi no-fly zones (1991\u20132003)===\n* [[File:Roundel of Iraq.svg|24px|Iraqi Air Force Roundel]] 20 March 1991 \u2013 USAF F-15C vs. IRAF Su-22 \u2013 In accordance with the ceasefire, an F-15C shoots down an Iraqi Su-22 bomber with an AIM-9 missile.\n* [[File:Roundel of Iraq.svg|24px|Iraqi Air Force Roundel]]27 December 1992 \u2013 USAF F-16 vs. IRAF MiG-25 \u2013 A MiG-25 crossed the no-fly zone and an F-16D shot it down with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.

With the non-catalyzed engine, this model heralded a re-focus on the Alpine name. The Renault logo was gone from the car, with an alpine logo up front and a large \"Alpine\" print appearing between the taillights. However, as the name 'Alpine' could not be used in the UK the name Alpine was removed from cars destined for the UK; there was no large print at the back of these cars and a UK specific logo was fitted to the front of the car. The Mille Miles, a limited edition of 100 cars, also featured a special dark red metallic paintjob, polished aluminium wheels, and a large silver-gray triangular stripe with the Alpine \"A\" across the left side of the front.<ref name=RenAlp/>\n\nIn February 1990 the limited edition Le Mans arrived, this car had a more aggressive body kit with polyester wheel arch extensions and a one piece front with smaller headlights. Wheels were 3 piece BBS style produced by ACT, 8x16\" front & 10x17\" rear. Many of these changes were adopted for the succeeding A610. The regular V6 GT and V6 Turbo ended production during 1990, while the Le Mans version continued to be produced until February 1991. 325 of these were built in total. Also in 1990, Renault was forced to install the less powerful catalyzed engine in cars destined for the home market, leading to grumbling amongst Alpine enthusiasts about the loss of power (down to {{Convert|185|PS|kW|abbr=on|disp=or}}) while the [[Renault 25|25 Turbo]] saloon actually gained power when it became catalyzed. In response Danielson SA, a famous French tuner, created an upgraded version of the Le Mans with {{convert|210|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nRenault had planned a federalized version of the Alpine V6 Turbo all along, originally for the 1986 model year, but development proceeded slowly.<ref name=tough>{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Lovell | first = Bill | pages = 10\u201312 | date = 1984-04-08 | title = Tough Company | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 35 | number = 14 | publisher = Crain Press Inc. }}</ref> The US model had an emissions cleaned engine with {{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, bigger bumpers, and flip-up headlamps ([http://www.renaultalpine.co.uk/gallery/album.php?album_id=2&sk=t&sd=a&st=0&start=11 photo]).<ref name=tough/> Various crash safety improvements were also carried out, and it was planned to install a softer suspension.

Due to a limited budget at the beginning of the project, its appearance does not differ much from the GTA, and it looks quite similar to the USA GTA with its pop-up headlights. Nonetheless, it is a completely different car, sharing only the windows with the GTA. The basic concepts of all Alpine cars are there (e.g. the [[rear engine]], and the steel backbone chassis that all Alpines since the A110 have had). The car was solely branded as an '''Alpine''', as linking Alpine and Renault together (first as Alpine-Renault then Renault-Alpine) seemed to detract from the Alpine brand's sporty image. The [[PRV engine]] remained, but it was enlarged to {{convert|2975|cc|L|1|order=flip}},<ref name = officialrenaultpage>{{cite web|url=https://www.renault.de/entdecken-sie-renault/ueber-renault/modellgeschichte.html|title=Modellgeschichte|website=Renault|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> which enabled it to produce {{Convert|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,750 rpm<ref name = officialrenaultpage/> and {{Convert|350|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 2,900 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/auto/nachrichten/renault-alpine-a610-donnerkeil-aus-dieppe-/6711944.html|title=Renault-Alpine A610: Donnerkeil aus Dieppe|website=www.handelsblatt.com|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> The engine was originally {{convert|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}}, but as with all PRV engines, it was downsized to {{convert|2963|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} in March 1993 to better fit the Swiss taxation system.\n\nThe '''A610 [[Albertville]] 92''' was presented in 1991 for the [[1992 Winter Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. Two examples, and other Renault cars, were used to drive VIPs, before being sold. They had a specific color (Gardenia White) and interior, but used the standard engine and technical specifications.\n\nThe '''A610 Magny-Cours''' was created for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault Sport|Renault]] Formula One victory in the [[French Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] in [[1991 French Grand Prix|July 1991]]. 31 cars were built, with specific color and interior. They carry a \"Magny-Cours\" legend on the doors and have body-colored rims.\n\nThe A610 did not result in an improvement in sales over the commercially disappointing GTA and the car was discontinued in 1995, despite acclaim from the motoring press, and approval from the British car show [[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]. The A610 was to be the last car to carry the Alpine name until the 2017 release of the new [[Alpine A110 (2017)|Alpine A110]]. After production of the A610 ended, the Alpine factory in Dieppe produced the [[Renault Spider]]. 818 were built, 67 of which were right-hand-drive. Sales the first two years were acceptable, but from 1993 until production ended in 1995 a mere 80 cars were built.\n\nIn Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s 2007 direct to DVD film \u2018Supercar Showdown\u2019, the production infamously destroyed a particularly rare right-hand-drive example of the A610, by driving it into a concrete K-rail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LWGchdsJaA0|title=A610 on Top Gear 2007|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Specifications===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\"  cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n!

Longer, wider, and taller, it effectively updated the design of its predecessor, the [[Alpine A310]], updating that car's silhouette with modern design features like body-integrated bumpers and a triangular C-pillar with large rear windshield. Like its predecessor, it used the [[V6 PRV engine]] in a rear-engined layout, with extensive use of Polyester plastics and [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]] for the body panels making it lighter and quicker than rivals such as the [[Porsche 944]].

With the non-catalyzed engine, this model heralded a re-focus on the Alpine name. The Renault logo was gone from the car, with an alpine logo up front and a large \"Alpine\" print appearing between the taillights. However, as the name 'Alpine' could not be used in the UK the name Alpine was removed from cars destined for the UK; there was no large print at the back of these cars and a UK specific logo was fitted to the front of the car. The Mille Miles, a limited edition of 100 cars, also featured a special dark red metallic paintjob, polished aluminium wheels, and a large silver-gray triangular stripe with the Alpine \"A\" across the left side of the front.<ref name=RenAlp/>\n\nIn February 1990 the limited edition Le Mans arrived, this car had a more aggressive body kit with polyester wheel arch extensions and a one piece front with smaller headlights. Wheels were 3 piece BBS style produced by ACT, 8x16\" front & 10x17\" rear. Many of these changes were adopted for the succeeding A610. The regular V6 GT and V6 Turbo ended production during 1990, while the Le Mans version continued to be produced until February 1991. 325 of these were built in total. Also in 1990, Renault was forced to install the less powerful catalyzed engine in cars destined for the home market, leading to grumbling amongst Alpine enthusiasts about the loss of power (down to {{Convert|185|PS|kW|abbr=on|disp=or}}) while the [[Renault 25|25 Turbo]] saloon actually gained power when it became catalyzed. In response Danielson SA, a famous French tuner, created an upgraded version of the Le Mans with {{convert|210|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nRenault had planned a federalized version of the Alpine V6 Turbo all along, originally for the 1986 model year, but development proceeded slowly.<ref name=tough>{{cite magazine | magazine = [[Autoweek]] | last = Lovell | first = Bill | pages = 10\u201312 | date = 1984-04-08 | title = Tough Company | issn = 0192-9674 | volume = 35 | number = 14 | publisher = Crain Press Inc. }}</ref> The US model had an emissions cleaned engine with {{Convert|180|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, bigger bumpers, and flip-up headlamps ([http://www.renaultalpine.co.uk/gallery/album.php?album_id=2&sk=t&sd=a&st=0&start=11 photo]).<ref name=tough/> Various crash safety improvements were also carried out, and it was planned to install a softer suspension.

Due to a limited budget at the beginning of the project, its appearance does not differ much from the GTA, and it looks quite similar to the USA GTA with its pop-up headlights. Nonetheless, it is a completely different car, sharing only the windows with the GTA. The basic concepts of all Alpine cars are there (e.g. the [[rear engine]], and the steel backbone chassis that all Alpines since the A110 have had). The car was solely branded as an '''Alpine''', as linking Alpine and Renault together (first as Alpine-Renault then Renault-Alpine) seemed to detract from the Alpine brand's sporty image. The [[PRV engine]] remained, but it was enlarged to {{convert|2975|cc|L|1|order=flip}},<ref name = officialrenaultpage>{{cite web|url=https://www.renault.de/entdecken-sie-renault/ueber-renault/modellgeschichte.html|title=Modellgeschichte|website=Renault|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> which enabled it to produce {{Convert|250|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,750 rpm<ref name = officialrenaultpage/> and {{Convert|350|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 2,900 rpm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/auto/nachrichten/renault-alpine-a610-donnerkeil-aus-dieppe-/6711944.html|title=Renault-Alpine A610: Donnerkeil aus Dieppe|website=www.handelsblatt.com|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref> The engine was originally {{convert|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}}, but as with all PRV engines, it was downsized to {{convert|2963|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} in March 1993 to better fit the Swiss taxation system.\n\nThe '''A610 [[Albertville]] 92''' was presented in 1991 for the [[1992 Winter Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. Two examples, and other Renault cars, were used to drive VIPs, before being sold. They had a specific color (Gardenia White) and interior, but used the standard engine and technical specifications.\n\nThe '''A610 Magny-Cours''' was created for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault Sport|Renault]] Formula One victory in the [[French Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] in [[1991 French Grand Prix|July 1991]]. 31 cars were built, with specific color and interior. They carry a \"Magny-Cours\" legend on the doors and have body-colored rims.\n\nThe A610 did not result in an improvement in sales over the commercially disappointing GTA and the car was discontinued in 1995, despite acclaim from the motoring press, and approval from the British car show [[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]. The A610 was to be the last car to carry the Alpine name until the 2017 release of the new [[Alpine A110 (2017)|Alpine A110]]. After production of the A610 ended, the Alpine factory in Dieppe produced the [[Renault Spider]]. 818 were built, 67 of which were right-hand-drive. Sales the first two years were acceptable, but from 1993 until production ended in 1995 a mere 80 cars were built.\n\nIn Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s 2007 direct to DVD film \u2018Supercar Showdown\u2019, the production infamously destroyed a particularly rare right-hand-drive example of the A610, by driving it into a concrete K-rail.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LWGchdsJaA0|title=A610 on Top Gear 2007|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Specifications===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\"  cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n!
