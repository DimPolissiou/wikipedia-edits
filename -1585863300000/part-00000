Justine has a [[dysfunctional family]]: brother-in-law John appears to resent having to pay for the wedding; father Dexter is [[hedonistic]] and selfish to the point of [[narcissism]], while mother Gaby is brutally jaded, her outspokenness leading John to throw her out of the house. No one ever asks what Justine wants, or why she is unhappy, but throughout the dinner she is praised for being beautiful. Claire urges Justine to hide her debilitating [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] from her new husband Michael. Justine flees the wedding reception in a golf cart. Frustrated by excessive fabric, she tears her dress getting out of the cart. At the eighteenth hole of the golf course on the estate, she looks up at the night sky, squatting to urinate on the hole.\n\nJustine's boss, Jack, is ruthless, greedy, and gluttonous. During his wedding speech, he's hustling Justine to meet a work deadline (she writes copy). He pushes her throughout the evening to create a [[tagline]] to promote a campaign based on a modern [[facsimile]] of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Land of Cockaigne]]'' (the mythical land of excess). She later opens an art book, only to find this same painting. Delaying the cutting of the wedding cake, Justine and Gaby independently escape to take baths.\n\nJustine's boss's nephew, Tim, is given the chance to exploit the opportunity to get the tagline at all costs in order to promote his career: a task similar to what Justine was previously so successful at. He reluctantly, but doggedly, pursues Justine throughout the wedding reception. She cannot [[consummate]] her marriage with her husband and eventually goes out onto a sand trap and has sex with Tim. Unable to get the tagline from Justine, Tim is later fired for his \"professional\" failure, but Justine also resigns, telling Jack that he is a \"despicable, power-hungry little man.\" After several hours of being alienated from each other, Justine and Michael quietly agree to call off the marriage. Michael departs. Early the following morning, while horseback riding with Claire, Justine notices [[Antares]] is no longer visible in the sky.\n\n=== Part Two: \"Claire\" ===\n\nLater, the reason for Antares's disappearance has become public knowledge: a newly discovered [[rogue planet]] called Melancholia, which entered the [[Solar System]] from behind the Sun, was blocking the star from view.\nThe planet has now become visible in the sky as it approaches ever closer to Earth. John is excited about the \"fly-by\" predicted by scientists, while Claire is frightened by alternate predictions of the earth being hit.\n\n[[File:EarthAndMelancholiaDanceOfDeath.svg|thumb|Melancholia's first approach and final collision with Earth, as described (and shown briefly in a similar diagram) in the film]]\n\nIn the meantime, Justine's depression has grown worse. She is placed in the care of Claire and John. Justine is essentially catatonic and Claire is unable to help her, even to assist her into the bath. In an effort to cheer her up, Claire makes [[meatloaf]]. Justine admits that she is so numb that even her favourite meal tastes of ash.\n\nAs Justine is forced into waking patterns, her connection to her beloved black horse Abraham becomes remote and frustrating. On two occasions, the horse refuses to cross a bridge over a river. Justine acts brutally towards the horse and eventually whips him mercilessly to the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Claire is fearful that the end of the world is imminent, despite her husband's assurances. She searches the Internet and finds an article predicting that Melancholia and the Earth will, in fact, collide. Her husband assures her that these anecdotes are written by \"prophets of doom\" looking for their 15 minutes of fame. Claire tries to relax. The next day, a somewhat-healthier Justine confesses to Claire that she simply \"knows\" certain things\u2014like the number of beans in the bottle at her wedding reception and that Earth and Melancholia will actually destroy each other. What's more, Justine says: this is a good thing because the Earth is evil.\n\nThat night, Melancholia passes Earth, as predicted by the scientists (to great relief). However, the next day Claire realizes (when using a circular device made by her son) that Melancholia is actually getting bigger and circling back\u2014as predicted by the Internet article. She begins to [[panic]]. She looks for John, only to find him dead in the stables (he purposefully overdosed on pills Claire was saving). Claire, realizing Melancholia's impending arrival, releases Abraham. Later when Justine asks where John is, Claire says that he has ridden into the village with Abraham.\n\nClaire calls the rest of her family together for a completely typical breakfast. Justine, noticing John's absence, questions Claire's intentions. Suddenly, as a result of Melancholia's proximity to Earth, a hailstorm starts. A panicked Claire tries to escape the estate with her son, but the cars will not start, and the golf cart shuts down as she attempts to cross the same bridge that Justine had attempted earlier. Returning to the mansion, Claire tries to accept the inevitable. In a private conversation with Justine, Claire suggests that their last act be coming together on the terrace with wine and music. Justine crassly dismisses her idea.\n\nHaving noticed that Abraham is wandering around the estate without any sign of his father, Claire's son, Leo, is frightened. \"Dad said there's nothing to do, nowhere to hide,\" Leo says, aware of Melancholia's closeness. He is reassured by Justine, who says that they can be safe in a \"magic cave\", something she had promised to build several times throughout the film. \nThey gather tree sticks to build the cave in the form of a [[teepee]] without canvas.\n\nThe \"magic cave\" stands in the middle of a field on the golf course. Leo, Justine, and Claire sit in the teepee, holding hands as the final storm begins. Leo believes in the magic cave and closes his eyes. Claire is terrified and cries profusely. Justine watches them both, and accepts her fate calmly and stoically. In the last shot Claire shudders, Leo and Justine sit in [[Meditative postures|meditative posture]] as Melancholia fills the sky behind the teepee, then a wall of fire passes through the field as the planets collide, killing them as a result of the firestorm. The sounds of the destruction of both planets echo and rumble while the screen fades to black.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    =Lead actresses [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] during the film's presentation at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].\n| width     = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    =Kirsten Dunst Cannes 2011.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (200 * 750 / 1158) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Charlotte Gainsbourg Cannes 2011.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (200 * 635 / 1050) round 0}}\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Justine\n* [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as Claire\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Michael\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as John, Claire's husband\n* Cameron Spurr as Leo\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Gaby, Justine and Claire's mother\n* [[John Hurt]] as Dexter, Justine and Claire's father\n* [[Jesper Christensen]] as Little Father, The Butler\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Jack, Justine's boss\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Tim\n* [[Udo Kier]] as The Wedding Planner\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for the film originated during a therapy session [[Lars von Trier]] attended during treatments for his depression. A therapist had told von Trier that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. Von Trier then developed the story not primarily as a disaster film, and without any ambition to portray [[astrophysics]] realistically, but as a way to examine the human psyche during a disaster.<ref name=onlyredeeming>{{Cite journal |last = Juul Carlsen |first = Per |date = May 2011 |url = http://www.dfi.dk/Service/English/News-and-publications/FILM-Magazine/Artikler-fra-tidsskriftet-FILM/72/The-Only-Redeeming-Factor-is-the-World-Ending.aspx |title = The Only Redeeming Factor is the World Ending |journal = Film |issue = 72 |pages = 5\u20138 |editor = Neimann, Susanna |publisher = [[Danish Film Institute]] |issn = 1399-2813 |accessdate = 18 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.birchbarkletter.com/film/second-look-lars-von-triers-melancholia/ |title = Second Look: Melancholia |publisher = birchbarkletter.com |date = 2012-05-14 |accessdate = 2012-05-16 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722111310/http://www.birchbarkletter.com/film/second-look-lars-von-triers-melancholia/ |archivedate = 22 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{quote box|align=left|width=45%|quote=\"In a [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond movie]] we expect the hero to survive.

Von Trier decided from the outset that it would be clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]]. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play ''[[The Maids]]'' by [[Jean Genet]]. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in ''Melancholia''. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself.<ref name=pkinterview>{{cite web |last = Thorsen |first = Nils |year = 2011 |url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/042199.pdf |title = Longing for the End of All |work = English press kit Melancholia |publisher = TrustNordisk |accessdate = 18 May 2011 }}</ref> The name was inspired by the 1791 novel ''[[Justine (Sade)|Justine]]'' by the [[Marquis de Sade]].<ref name=iwinterview>{{cite web |last = Feinstein |first = Howard |date = 20 May 2011 |url = http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lars_von_trier_i_will_never_do_a_press_conference_again |title = Lars von Trier: 'I will never do a press conference again.' |work = [[indieWire]] |publisher = [[SnagFilms]] |accessdate = 21 May 2011<!-- archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ypdVoXAv?url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lars_von_trier_i_will_never_do_a_press_conference_again --> }}</ref>\n\n''Melancholia'' was produced by Denmark's [[Zentropa]], with co-production support from its subsidiary in Germany, Sweden's Memfis Film, France's Slot Machine and Liberator Productions.<ref name=dfi>{{cite web |url = http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/danishfilms/dffilm.aspx?id=25228 |title = Melancholia |work = Danish Films |publisher = [[Danish Film Institute]] |accessdate = 5 August 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110214124319/http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/danishfilms/dffilm.aspx?id=25228 |archive-date = 14 February 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The production received 7.9 million [[Danish krone]]r from the [[Danish Film Institute]], 600,000 euro from [[Eurimages]] and 3 million [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] from the [[Swedish Film Institute]].<ref name=stoette>{{cite web |last = Fil-Jensen |first = Lars |date = 22 June 2010 |url = http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/NyhederFraDFI/2010/Stoette-til-Caroline-Mathildes-aar-og-Melancholia.aspx |title = St\u00f8tte til Caroline Mathildes \u00e5r og Melancholia |language = Danish |work = dfi.dk |publisher = [[Danish Film Institute]] |accessdate = 19 July 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100902050051/http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/NyhederFraDFI/2010/Stoette-til-Caroline-Mathildes-aar-og-Melancholia.aspx |archivedate = 2 September 2010 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2010/Dramerna-dominerar-produktionsstoden-i-juni/|title=Dramerna dominerar produktionsst\u00f6den i juni|last=Roger|first=Susanne|date=22 June 2010|work=Filmnyheterna|publisher=[[Swedish Film Institute]]|language=Swedish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008225753/http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2010/Dramerna-dominerar-produktionsstoden-i-juni/|archivedate=8 October 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}<!-- Link not working anymore.

Claro said about the method: \"[von Trier] wants to experience the situations the first time. He finds an energy in the scenes, presence, and makes up with the photographic aesthetics.\"<ref name=absurdteater /> Trier explained that the visual style he aimed at in ''Melancholia'' was \"a clash between what is romantic and grand and stylized and then some form of reality\", which he hoped to achieve through the hand-held camerawork.<ref name=pkinterview /> He feared however that it would tilt too much toward the romantic, because of the setting at the upscale wedding, and the castle, which he called \"super [[kitsch]]y\".<ref name=pkinterview /><ref name=svd />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe prelude to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' supplies the main musical theme of the film, and Trier's use of an overture-like opening sequence before the first act is a technique closely associated with [[Richard_Wagner|Wagner]]. This choice was inspired by a 30-page section of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'', where Proust concludes that Wagner's prelude is the greatest work of art of all time. ''Melancholia'' uses music more than any film by Trier since ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' from 1984. In some scenes, the film was edited in the same pace as the music. Trier said: \"It's kind of like a music video that way. It's supposed to be vulgar.\"<ref name=onlyredeeming /> Trier also pointed out parallels between both the film's usage of [[Richard_Wagner|Wagner]] and the film's editing to the music and the aesthetics of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=onlyredeeming />\n\nVisual effects were provided by companies in Poland, Germany and Sweden under visual effects supervisor Peter Hjorth. Poland's Platige Image, which previously had worked with Trier on ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', created most of the effects seen in the film's opening sequence; the earliest instructions were provided by Trier in the summer 2010, after which a team of 19 visual effects artists worked on the project for three months.<ref>{{cite web |author = Staff writer |date = 10 May 2011 |url = http://community.platige.com/news/532?lng=en |title = Special effects for 'Melancholia' |work = Platige Image Community |accessdate = 8 June 2011 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5zIJk60cf?url=http://community.platige.com/news/532?lng=en |archivedate = 8 June 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nIn his [[director's statement]], Trier wrote that he had started to regret having made such a polished film, but that he hoped it would contain some flaws which would make it interesting.

The film is a Danish production by [[Zentropa]], with [[International co-production|international co-producers]] in Sweden, France, Germany and Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/melancholia-v538080 |title=Melancholia (2011) \u2013 Lars von Trier |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4f4b8d17bedb4 |title=Melancholia (2011) |work=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref> Filming took place in Sweden.

Justine has a [[dysfunctional family]]: brother-in-law John appears to resent having to pay for the wedding; father Dexter is [[hedonistic]] and selfish to the point of [[narcissism]], while mother Gaby is brutally jaded, her outspokenness leading John to throw her out of the house. No one ever asks what Justine wants, or why she is unhappy, but throughout the dinner she is praised for being beautiful. Claire urges Justine to hide her debilitating [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] from her new husband Michael. Justine flees the wedding reception in a golf cart. Frustrated by excessive fabric, she tears her dress getting out of the cart. At the eighteenth hole of the golf course on the estate, she looks up at the night sky, squatting to urinate on the hole.\n\nJustine's boss, Jack, is ruthless, greedy, and gluttonous. During his wedding speech, he's hustling Justine to meet a work deadline (she writes copy). He pushes her throughout the evening to create a [[tagline]] to promote a campaign based on a modern [[facsimile]] of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Land of Cockaigne]]'' (the mythical land of excess). She later opens an art book, only to find this same painting. Delaying the cutting of the wedding cake, Justine and Gaby independently escape to take baths.\n\nJustine's boss's nephew, Tim, is given the chance to exploit the opportunity to get the tagline at all costs in order to promote his career: a task similar to what Justine was previously so successful at. He reluctantly, but doggedly, pursues Justine throughout the wedding reception. She cannot [[consummate]] her marriage with her husband and eventually goes out onto a sand trap and has sex with Tim. Unable to get the tagline from Justine, Tim is later fired for his \"professional\" failure, but Justine also resigns, telling Jack that he is a \"despicable, power-hungry little man.\" After several hours of being alienated from each other, Justine and Michael quietly agree to call off the marriage. Michael departs. Early the following morning, while horseback riding with Claire, Justine notices [[Antares]] is no longer visible in the sky.\n\n=== Part Two: \"Claire\" ===\n\nLater, the reason for Antares's disappearance has become public knowledge: a newly discovered [[rogue planet]] called Melancholia, which entered the [[Solar System]] from behind the Sun, was blocking the star from view.\nThe planet has now become visible in the sky as it approaches ever closer to Earth. John is excited about the \"fly-by\" predicted by scientists, while Claire is frightened by alternate predictions of the earth being hit.\n\n[[File:EarthAndMelancholiaDanceOfDeath.svg|thumb|Melancholia's first approach and final collision with Earth, as described (and shown briefly in a similar diagram) in the film]]\n\nIn the meantime, Justine's depression has grown worse. She is placed in the care of Claire and John. Justine is essentially catatonic and Claire is unable to help her, even to assist her into the bath. In an effort to cheer her up, Claire makes [[meatloaf]]. Justine admits that she is so numb that even her favourite meal tastes of ash.\n\nAs Justine is forced into waking patterns, her connection to her beloved black horse Abraham becomes remote and frustrating. On two occasions, the horse refuses to cross a bridge over a river. Justine acts brutally towards the horse and eventually whips him mercilessly to the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Claire is fearful that the end of the world is imminent, despite her husband's assurances. She searches the Internet and finds an article predicting that Melancholia and the Earth will, in fact, collide. Her husband assures her that these anecdotes are written by \"prophets of doom\" looking for their 15 minutes of fame. Claire tries to relax. The next day, a somewhat-healthier Justine confesses to Claire that she simply \"knows\" certain things\u2014like the number of beans in the bottle at her wedding reception and that Earth and Melancholia will actually destroy each other. What's more, Justine says: this is a good thing because the Earth is evil.\n\nThat night, Melancholia passes Earth, as predicted by the scientists (to great relief). However, the next day Claire realizes (when using a circular device made by her son) that Melancholia is actually getting bigger and circling back\u2014as predicted by the Internet article. She begins to [[panic]]. She looks for John, only to find him dead in the stables (he purposefully overdosed on pills Claire was saving). Claire, realizing Melancholia's impending arrival, releases Abraham. Later when Justine asks where John is, Claire says that he has ridden into the village with Abraham.\n\nClaire calls the rest of her family together for a completely typical breakfast. Justine, noticing John's absence, questions Claire's intentions. Suddenly, as a result of Melancholia's proximity to Earth, a hailstorm starts. A panicked Claire tries to escape the estate with her son, but the cars will not start, and the golf cart shuts down as she attempts to cross the same bridge that Justine had attempted earlier. Returning to the mansion, Claire tries to accept the inevitable. In a private conversation with Justine, Claire suggests that their last act be coming together on the terrace with wine and music. Justine crassly dismisses her idea.\n\nHaving noticed that Abraham is wandering around the estate without any sign of his father, Claire's son, Leo, is frightened. \"Dad said there's nothing to do, nowhere to hide,\" Leo says, aware of Melancholia's closeness. He is reassured by Justine, who says that they can be safe in a \"magic cave\", something she had promised to build several times throughout the film. \nThey gather tree sticks to build the cave in the form of a [[teepee]] without canvas.\n\nThe \"magic cave\" stands in the middle of a field on the golf course. Leo, Justine, and Claire sit in the teepee, holding hands as the final storm begins. Leo believes in the magic cave and closes his eyes. Claire is terrified and cries profusely. Justine watches them both, and accepts her fate calmly and stoically. In the last shot Claire shudders, Leo and Justine sit in [[Meditative postures|meditative posture]] as Melancholia fills the sky behind the teepee, then a wall of fire passes through the field as the planets collide, killing them as a result of the firestorm. The sounds of the destruction of both planets echo and rumble while the screen fades to black.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    =Lead actresses [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] during the film's presentation at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].\n| width     = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    =Kirsten Dunst Cannes 2011.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (200 * 750 / 1158) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Charlotte Gainsbourg Cannes 2011.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (200 * 635 / 1050) round 0}}\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Justine\n* [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as Claire\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Michael\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as John, Claire's husband\n* Cameron Spurr as Leo\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Gaby, Justine and Claire's mother\n* [[John Hurt]] as Dexter, Justine and Claire's father\n* [[Jesper Christensen]] as Little Father, The Butler\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Jack, Justine's boss\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Tim\n* [[Udo Kier]] as The Wedding Planner\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for the film originated during a therapy session [[Lars von Trier]] attended during treatments for his depression. A therapist had told von Trier that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. Von Trier then developed the story not primarily as a disaster film, and without any ambition to portray [[astrophysics]] realistically, but as a way to examine the human psyche during a disaster.<ref name=onlyredeeming>{{Cite journal |last = Juul Carlsen |first = Per |date = May 2011 |url = http://www.dfi.dk/Service/English/News-and-publications/FILM-Magazine/Artikler-fra-tidsskriftet-FILM/72/The-Only-Redeeming-Factor-is-the-World-Ending.aspx |title = The Only Redeeming Factor is the World Ending |journal = Film |issue = 72 |pages = 5\u20138 |editor = Neimann, Susanna |publisher = [[Danish Film Institute]] |issn = 1399-2813 |accessdate = 18 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.birchbarkletter.com/film/second-look-lars-von-triers-melancholia/ |title = Second Look: Melancholia |publisher = birchbarkletter.com |date = 2012-05-14 |accessdate = 2012-05-16 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722111310/http://www.birchbarkletter.com/film/second-look-lars-von-triers-melancholia/ |archivedate = 22 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{quote box|align=left|width=45%|quote=\"In a [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond movie]] we expect the hero to survive.

Von Trier decided from the outset that it would be clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]]. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play ''[[The Maids]]'' by [[Jean Genet]]. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in ''Melancholia''. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself.<ref name=pkinterview>{{cite web |last = Thorsen |first = Nils |year = 2011 |url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/042199.pdf |title = Longing for the End of All |work = English press kit Melancholia |publisher = TrustNordisk |accessdate = 18 May 2011 }}</ref> The name was inspired by the 1791 novel ''[[Justine (Sade)|Justine]]'' by the [[Marquis de Sade]].<ref name=iwinterview>{{cite web |last = Feinstein |first = Howard |date = 20 May 2011 |url = http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lars_von_trier_i_will_never_do_a_press_conference_again |title = Lars von Trier: 'I will never do a press conference again.' |work = [[indieWire]] |publisher = [[SnagFilms]] |accessdate = 21 May 2011<!-- archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ypdVoXAv?url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lars_von_trier_i_will_never_do_a_press_conference_again --> }}</ref>\n\n''Melancholia'' was produced by Denmark's [[Zentropa]], with co-production support from its subsidiary in Germany, Sweden's Memfis Film, France's Slot Machine and Liberator Productions.<ref name=dfi>{{cite web |url = http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/danishfilms/dffilm.aspx?id=25228 |title = Melancholia |work = Danish Films |publisher = [[Danish Film Institute]] |accessdate = 5 August 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110214124319/http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/danishfilms/dffilm.aspx?id=25228 |archive-date = 14 February 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The production received 7.9 million [[Danish krone]]r from the [[Danish Film Institute]], 600,000 euro from [[Eurimages]] and 3 million [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] from the [[Swedish Film Institute]].<ref name=stoette>{{cite web |last = Fil-Jensen |first = Lars |date = 22 June 2010 |url = http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/NyhederFraDFI/2010/Stoette-til-Caroline-Mathildes-aar-og-Melancholia.aspx |title = St\u00f8tte til Caroline Mathildes \u00e5r og Melancholia |language = Danish |work = dfi.dk |publisher = [[Danish Film Institute]] |accessdate = 19 July 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100902050051/http://www.dfi.dk/Nyheder/NyhederFraDFI/2010/Stoette-til-Caroline-Mathildes-aar-og-Melancholia.aspx |archivedate = 2 September 2010 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2010/Dramerna-dominerar-produktionsstoden-i-juni/|title=Dramerna dominerar produktionsst\u00f6den i juni|last=Roger|first=Susanne|date=22 June 2010|work=Filmnyheterna|publisher=[[Swedish Film Institute]]|language=Swedish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008225753/http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2010/Dramerna-dominerar-produktionsstoden-i-juni/|archivedate=8 October 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}<!-- Link not working anymore.

Claro said about the method: \"[von Trier] wants to experience the situations the first time. He finds an energy in the scenes, presence, and makes up with the photographic aesthetics.\"<ref name=absurdteater /> Trier explained that the visual style he aimed at in ''Melancholia'' was \"a clash between what is romantic and grand and stylized and then some form of reality\", which he hoped to achieve through the hand-held camerawork.<ref name=pkinterview /> He feared however that it would tilt too much toward the romantic, because of the setting at the upscale wedding, and the castle, which he called \"super [[kitsch]]y\".<ref name=pkinterview /><ref name=svd />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe prelude to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' supplies the main musical theme of the film, and Trier's use of an overture-like opening sequence before the first act is a technique closely associated with [[Richard_Wagner|Wagner]]. This choice was inspired by a 30-page section of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'', where Proust concludes that Wagner's prelude is the greatest work of art of all time. ''Melancholia'' uses music more than any film by Trier since ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' from 1984. In some scenes, the film was edited in the same pace as the music. Trier said: \"It's kind of like a music video that way. It's supposed to be vulgar.\"<ref name=onlyredeeming /> Trier also pointed out parallels between both the film's usage of [[Richard_Wagner|Wagner]] and the film's editing to the music and the aesthetics of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=onlyredeeming />\n\nVisual effects were provided by companies in Poland, Germany and Sweden under visual effects supervisor Peter Hjorth.
