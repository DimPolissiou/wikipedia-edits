{"title_page": "Ergative\u2013absolutive language", "text_new": "{{Linguistic typology topics}}\n'''Ergative\u2013absolutive languages''', or '''ergative languages''', are languages that share a certain distinctive pattern relating to the [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] (technically, [[verb argument|arguments]]) of verbs. Examples are [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], a few [[Indo-European languages]] (such as the [[Kurdish languages]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]) and, to some degree, the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[modern Aramaic]] languages. \n\nIn an ergative language, the single argument (\"[[subject (grammar)|subject]]\") of an [[intransitive verb]] behaves like the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb, and differently from the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]].<ref>Comrie (1989), p. 110ff.</ref>\n\nThat is in contrast to [[Nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative\u2013accusative]] languages, such as [[English language|English]] and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of an intransitive verb (\"She\" in the sentence \"She walks.\") behaves grammatically like the agent of a transitive verb (\"She\" in the sentence \"She finds it.\") but differently from the object of a transitive verb (\"her\" in the sentence \"He likes her.\"). In ergative\u2013absolutive languages with [[grammatical case]], the case used for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb is the [[absolutive case|absolutive]], and the case used for the agent of a transitive verb is the [[ergative case|ergative]]. In nominative\u2013accusative languages, the case for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb is the [[nominative case|nominative]] while the case for the direct object of a transitive verb is the [[accusative case|accusative]]. \n\nThere is a variant group, the [[Tripartite language|ergative\u2013accusative languages]], otherwise known as [[split ergative]] languages, (such as [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]), which functions ergatively with respect to nouns but is nominative-accusative with pronouns.<ref>[[Robert M. W. Dixon]], ''Searching for Aboriginal Languages:Memoirs of a Field Worker,'' Cambridge University Press 2011 p.163</ref>{{failed verification|date=November 2018}}<!--He says that Dyirbal is nominative-accusative with pronouns, but he doesn't call that pattern \"ergative-accusative\"-->{{dubious|date=November 2018}}\n\nSeveral scholars have hypothesized that [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] was an ergative language. However, this hypothesis is disputed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bavant |first=Marc |title=Proto-Indo-European Ergativity...

For instance, [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and most [[Mayan languages]] have no morphological ergative case, but they have a verbal agreement structure that is ergative. In languages with ergative\u2013absolutive agreement systems, the absolutive form is usually the most [[markedness|unmarked]] form of a word (exceptions include [[Nias language|Nias]] and [[Tlapanec language|Tlapanec]]<ref>Donohue, Mark (2008). \"Semantic alignment systems: what's what, and what's not\". In Donohue, Mark & S\u00f8ren Wichmann, eds. (2008). ''The Typology of Semantic Alignment''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>).\n\nThe following examples from [[Basque language|Basque]] demonstrate an ergative\u2013absolutive case marking system:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | Ergative language\n|-\n! Sentence:\n| colspan=\"2\" | ''Martin etorri da.''\n|     \n| colspan=\"3\" | ''Martinek Diego ikusi du.''\n|-\n! Word:\n| Martin<span style=\"color:#008000\">'''-\u00d8'''</span>\n| etorri da\n|     \n| Martin<span style=\"color:#800000\">'''-ek'''</span>\n| Diego<span style=\"color:#008000\">'''-\u00d8'''</span>\n| ikusi du\n|-\n! Gloss:\n| Martin<span style=\"color:#008000\">'''-<small>ABS</small>'''</span>\n| has arrived\n|     \n| Martin<span style=\"color:#800000\">'''-<small>ERG</small>'''</span>\n| Diego<span style=\"color:#008000\">'''-<small>ABS</small>'''</span>\n| has seen\n|-\n!

Translation:\n| colspan=\"2\" | \"Martin has arrived.\"\n|     \n| colspan=\"3\" | \"Martin has seen Diego.\"\n|}\n\nHere \"-\u00d8\" represents a [[Null morpheme|zero morpheme]], as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque. The forms for the ergative are \"-k\" after a vowel, and \"-ek\" after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a [[determiner]]. The default determiner (commonly called the [[Article (grammar)|article]], which is suffixed to [[Noun|common nouns]] and usually translatable by \"the\" in English) is \"-a\" in the singular and \"-ak\" in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for \"gizon\" (\"man\" in English): gizon-a (man-the.sing.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.pl.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.sing.erg), gizon-ek (man-the.pl.erg). Note that when fused with the article, the absolutive plural is [[Homophony|homophonous]] with the ergative singular. See [[Basque grammar]] for details.<ref>King, Alan R. ''The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction.'' Reno: University of Nevada Press.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a nominative\u2013accusative language:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" | Accusative language\n|-\n! Sentence:\n| colspan=\"2\" | ''Otoko ga tsuita.''\n|     \n| colspan=\"3\" | ''Otoko ga kodomo o mita.''\n|-\n!

Translation:\n| colspan=\"2\" | \"The man arrived.\"\n|     \n| colspan=\"3\" | \"The man saw the child.\"\n|}\n\nIn this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same [[nominative case]] particle ''ga'', while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the [[accusative case]] o.\n\nIf one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative\u2013accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:\n\nAccusative English:\n\n:He (A) found me (O).\n\n:He (S) traveled.\n\n(S form = A form)\n\nHypothetical ergative English:\n\n:He (A) found me (O).\n\n:Him (S) traveled.\n\n(S form = O form)\n\nA number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative\u2013accusative marking on verbs and ergative\u2013absolutive case marking on nouns.\n\n[[Georgian language|Georgian]] also has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the [[perfective]] aspect (also known as the \"aorist [[screeve]]\"). Compare:\n\n:{{transl|ka|K'ac'i va\u0161ls \u010d'ams.}} ({{lang|ka|\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e8\u10da\u10e1 \u10ed\u10d0\u10db\u10e1}}) \"The man is eating an apple.\"\n:{{transl|ka|K'ac''''ma''' va\u0161li \u010d'ama.}} ({{lang|ka|\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10db\u10d0 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e8\u10da\u10d8 \u10ed\u10d0\u10db\u10d0}}) \"The man ate an apple.\"\n\n{{transl|ka|K'ac'-}} is the root of the word \"man\". In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case ({{transl|ka|k'ac'i}}&thinsp;). In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix {{transl|ka|-ma}}.\n\nHowever, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:\n\n:{{transl|ka|K'ac''''ma''' daacemina.}} ({{lang|ka|\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10db\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0\u10d0\u10ea\u10d4\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0}}) \"The man sneezed.\"\n\nAlthough the verb ''sneeze'' is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as \"sneeze\" used to have a direct object (the object being \"nose\" in the case of \"sneeze\") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.\n\n===Syntactic ergativity===\nErgativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying \u201cArrived I\u201d for \u201cI arrived\u201d, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.\n\nSyntactic ergativity may appear in:\n* [[Word order]] (for example, the absolutive argument comes before the verb and the ergative argument comes after it)\n* [[Syntactic pivot]]s\n* [[Relative clause]]s \u2013 determining which arguments are available for relativization\n* [[Subordination (linguistics)|Subordination]]\n* [[Switch reference]]\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Example====\n\nExample of syntactic ergativity in the \"[[conjunction reduction]]\" construction ([[coordinated clause]]s) in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] in contrast with English conjunction reduction.

Instead they posit that one should only speak of ''ergative\u2013absolutive systems'', which languages employ to different degrees.\n\nMany languages classified as ergative in fact show '''split ergativity''', whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. [[Basque language|Basque]] is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], though it shows thoroughly nominative\u2013accusative [[Morphosyntactic alignment|syntactic alignment]].<ref>{{Citation |title=The syntax and morphology of Basque |url=http://www.iker.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/agreementbasque1.pdf |access-date=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi]], the ergative case is marked on agents in the [[preterite]] and [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses for transitive and [[ditransitive verb]]s, while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.\n\n:''la\u1e5bk\u0101 kit\u0101b khar\u012bdt\u0101 hai''\n:{{mono|boy-NOMINATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-IMPERFECT-MASCULINE be-PRESENT}} \u00b9\n:\"The boy buys a book.\"\n\n:''la\u1e5bke ne kit\u0101b khar\u012bd\u012b''\n:{{mono|boy-ERGATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-PERFECT-FEMININE}} \u00b9\n:\"The boy bought a book.\"\n\n::''(\u00b9) The grammatical analysis has been simplified to show the features relevant to the example.''\n\n\nIn the Northern Kurdish language [[Kurmanji]], the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and \"future in the past\" tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:\n:(1) Ez di\u00e7im. (I go)\n:(2) Ez w\u00ee dib\u00eenim. (I see him.)\n:(3) Ew di\u00e7e. (He goes)\n:(4) Ew min dib\u00eene. (He sees me.)\n\nbut:\n:(5) Ez \u00e7\u00fbm. (I went)\n:(6) Min ew d\u00eet. (I saw him.)\n:(7) Ew \u00e7\u00fb. (He went.)\n:(8) W\u00ee ez d\u00eetim. (He saw me.)\n\nIn sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs.  \n\nIn [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], pronouns are morphologically nominative\u2013accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.\n\n===Optional ergativity===\n\nMany languages with ergative marking display what is known as ''optional ergativity'', where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly ''optional'' but is affected by [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]. Note that unlike [[split ergativity]], which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.\n\nOptional ergativity may be motivated by:\n* The [[animacy]] of the subject, with more ''animate'' subjects more likely to be marked ergative\n* The [[semantics]] of the verb, with more ''active'' or ''transitive'' verbs more likely to be marked ergative\n* The [[grammatical structure]] or [tense-aspect-mood]\n\nLanguages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.<ref>McGregor (2010) Optional ergative case marking systems in a typological-semiotic perspective.

See [[Austronesian alignment]].\n*In the [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Lishana Deni]], [[Koy Sanjaq Syriac language]] and others) [[split ergativity]] formed in the [[perfective]] aspect only, whereas the [[imperfective]] aspect is nominative-accusative. Some dialects would only mark [[unaccusative]] subjects as ergative. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, in particular, has an ergative type of construction of the [[perfective past]] verbal base, where foregone actions are verbalized by a passive construction with the [[patient (grammar)|patient]] being conferred as the [[grammatical subject]] rather than by an active construction, e.g. ''baxta qtile'' (\"the woman was killed by him\"). The ergative type of inflection with an agentive phrase has been extended by analogy to intransitive verbs, e.g. ''qim-le'' (\"he has risen\").<ref>A. Mengozzi, Neo-Aramaic and the So-called Decay of Ergativity in Kurdish, in: Proceedings of the 10th Meeting of Hamito-Semitic (Afroasiatic) Linguistics (Florence, 18\u201320 April 2005), Dipartamento di Linguistica Universit\u00e0 di Firenze 2005, pp. 239\u2013256.</ref> To note, [[Aramaic]] has historically been a nominative-accusative language.<ref>Khan, Geoffrey. 1999. A Grammar of Neo-Aramaic: The Dialect of the Jews of Arbel. Leiden: Brill. </ref> \n\n===Sign languages===\nSign languages (for example, [[Nepalese Sign Language#NSL Morhosyntax|Nepali Sign Language]]) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of [[Actant#In linguistics|actant]] incorporation in verbs.<ref>MW Morgan (2009) Cross-Linguistic Typology of Argument Encoding in Sign Language Verbal Morphology. Paper presented at Association of Linguistic Typology, Berkeley</ref> In [[sign language]]s that have been studied, [[classifier handshape]]s are incorporated into verbs, indicating the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of [[intransitive verb]]s when incorporated, and the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verb]]s. (If we follow the \"[[semantic phonology]]\" model proposed by [[William Stokoe]] (1991)<ref>William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. Sign Language Studies, 71 ,107\u2013114.</ref> this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in [[Nepali Sign Language]] the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a [[manual alphabet]] handshape \u091a /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word TEA \u091a\u093f\u092f\u093e /chiya:/) being incorporated as the [[Object (grammar)|object]].)\n\n==Approximations of ergativity in English==\n\nEnglish has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix \"-ee\" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:\n\n:\"John has retired\" \u2192 \"John is a retiree\"\n:\"John has escaped\" \u2192 \"John is an escapee\"\n\nHowever, with a transitive verb, adding \"-ee\" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:\n\n:\"Susie employs Mike\" \u2192 \"Mike is an employee\"\n:\"Mike has appointed Susie\" \u2192 \"Susie is an appointee\"\n\nEtymologically, the sense in which \"-ee\" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French [[past participle]]s in \"-\u00e9\". This is still the prevalent sense in [[British English]]: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American [[neologism|coinage]]s and all except \"escapee\" are still marked as \"chiefly U.S.\" by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\nEnglish also has a number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.\n\nWhen English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition \"of\" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with \"of\"). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with \"by\" as in a passive construction):\n\n:\"(a dentist) extracts a tooth\" \u2192 \"the extraction of a tooth (by a dentist)\"\n:\"(I/The editor) revised the essay\" \u2192 \"(my/the editor's) revision of the essay\"\n:\"(I was surprised that) the water boiled\" \u2192 \"(I was surprised at) the boiling of the water\"\n:\"I departed on time (so I could catch the plane)\" \u2192 \"My timely departure (allowed me to catch the plane)\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[Absolutive case]]\n*[[Austronesian alignment]]\n*[[Ergative case]]\n*[[Ergative verb]]\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*[[Split ergativity]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)]]\n*[[Unaccusative verb]]\n*[[Unergative verb]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Searching for Aboriginal Languages: Memoirs of a Field Worker\n | last = Dixon | first = R.

The forms for the ergative are \"-k\" after a vowel, and \"-ek\" after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a [[determiner]]. The default determiner (commonly called the [[Article (grammar)|article]], which is suffixed to [[Noun|common nouns]] and usually translatable by \"the\" in English) is \"-a\" in the singular and \"-ak\" in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for \"gizon\" (\"man\" in English): gizon-a (man-the.sing.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.pl.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.sing.erg), gizon-ek (man-the.pl.erg). Note that when fused with the article, the absolutive plural is [[Homophony|homophonous]] with the ergative singular. See [[Basque grammar]] for details.<ref>King, Alan R.

Translation:\n| colspan=\"2\" | \"The man arrived.\"\n|     \n| colspan=\"3\" | \"The man saw the child.\"\n|}\n\nIn this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same [[nominative case]] particle ''ga'', while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the [[accusative case]] o.\n\nIf one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative\u2013accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:\n\nAccusative English:\n\n:He (A) found me (O).\n\n:He (S) traveled.\n\n(S form = A form)\n\nHypothetical ergative English:\n\n:He (A) found me (O).\n\n:Him (S) traveled.\n\n(S form = O form)\n\nA number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative\u2013accusative marking on verbs and ergative\u2013absolutive case marking on nouns.\n\n[[Georgian language|Georgian]] also has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the [[perfective]] aspect (also known as the \"aorist [[screeve]]\"). Compare:\n\n:{{transl|ka|K'ac'i va\u0161ls \u010d'ams.}} ({{lang|ka|\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e8\u10da\u10e1 \u10ed\u10d0\u10db\u10e1}}) \"The man is eating an apple.\"\n:{{transl|ka|K'ac''''ma''' va\u0161li \u010d'ama.}} ({{lang|ka|\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10db\u10d0 \u10d5\u10d0\u10e8\u10da\u10d8 \u10ed\u10d0\u10db\u10d0}}) \"The man ate an apple.\"\n\n{{transl|ka|K'ac'-}} is the root of the word \"man\". In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case ({{transl|ka|k'ac'i}}&thinsp;). In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix {{transl|ka|-ma}}.\n\nHowever, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:\n\n:{{transl|ka|K'ac''''ma''' daacemina.}} ({{lang|ka|\u10d9\u10d0\u10ea\u10db\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0\u10d0\u10ea\u10d4\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0}}) \"The man sneezed.\"\n\nAlthough the verb ''sneeze'' is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as \"sneeze\" used to have a direct object (the object being \"nose\" in the case of \"sneeze\") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.\n\n===Syntactic ergativity===\nErgativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying \u201cArrived I\u201d for \u201cI arrived\u201d, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.\n\nSyntactic ergativity may appear in:\n* [[Word order]] (for example, the absolutive argument comes before the verb and the ergative argument comes after it)\n* [[Syntactic pivot]]s\n* [[Relative clause]]s \u2013 determining which arguments are available for relativization\n* [[Subordination (linguistics)|Subordination]]\n* [[Switch reference]]\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Example====\n\nExample of syntactic ergativity in the \"[[conjunction reduction]]\" construction ([[coordinated clause]]s) in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]] in contrast with English conjunction reduction.

Instead they posit that one should only speak of ''ergative\u2013absolutive systems'', which languages employ to different degrees.\n\nMany languages classified as ergative in fact show '''split ergativity''', whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. [[Basque language|Basque]] is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], though it shows thoroughly nominative\u2013accusative [[Morphosyntactic alignment|syntactic alignment]].<ref>{{Citation |title=The syntax and morphology of Basque |url=http://www.iker.cnrs.fr/IMG/pdf/agreementbasque1.pdf |access-date=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi]], the ergative case is marked on agents in the [[preterite]] and [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tenses for transitive and [[ditransitive verb]]s, while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.\n\n:''la\u1e5bk\u0101 kit\u0101b khar\u012bdt\u0101 hai''\n:{{mono|boy-NOMINATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-IMPERFECT-MASCULINE be-PRESENT}} \u00b9\n:\"The boy buys a book.\"\n\n:''la\u1e5bke ne kit\u0101b khar\u012bd\u012b''\n:{{mono|boy-ERGATIVE-MASCULINE book-NOMINATIVE-FEMININE buy-PERFECT-FEMININE}} \u00b9\n:\"The boy bought a book.\"\n\n::''(\u00b9) The grammatical analysis has been simplified to show the features relevant to the example.''\n\n\nIn the Northern Kurdish language [[Kurmanji]], the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and \"future in the past\" tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:\n:(1) Ez di\u00e7im. (I go)\n:(2) Ez w\u00ee dib\u00eenim. (I see him.)\n:(3) Ew di\u00e7e. (He goes)\n:(4) Ew min dib\u00eene. (He sees me.)\n\nbut:\n:(5) Ez \u00e7\u00fbm. (I went)\n:(6) Min ew d\u00eet. (I saw him.)\n:(7) Ew \u00e7\u00fb. (He went.)\n:(8) W\u00ee ez d\u00eetim. (He saw me.)\n\nIn sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs.  \n\nIn [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], pronouns are morphologically nominative\u2013accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.\n\n===Optional ergativity===\n\nMany languages with ergative marking display what is known as ''optional ergativity'', where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly ''optional'' but is affected by [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]. Note that unlike [[split ergativity]], which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.\n\nOptional ergativity may be motivated by:\n* The [[animacy]] of the subject, with more ''animate'' subjects more likely to be marked ergative\n* The [[semantics]] of the verb, with more ''active'' or ''transitive'' verbs more likely to be marked ergative\n* The [[grammatical structure]] or [tense-aspect-mood]\n\nLanguages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.<ref>McGregor (2010) Optional ergative case marking systems in a typological-semiotic perspective.

See [[Austronesian alignment]].\n*In the [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Lishana Deni]], [[Koy Sanjaq Syriac language]] and others) [[split ergativity]] formed in the [[perfective]] aspect only, whereas the [[imperfective]] aspect is nominative-accusative. Some dialects would only mark [[unaccusative]] subjects as ergative. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, in particular, has an ergative type of construction of the [[perfective past]] verbal base, where foregone actions are verbalized by a passive construction with the [[patient (grammar)|patient]] being conferred as the [[grammatical subject]] rather than by an active construction, e.g. ''baxta qtile'' (\"the woman was killed by him\"). The ergative type of inflection with an agentive phrase has been extended by analogy to intransitive verbs, e.g. ''qim-le'' (\"he has risen\").<ref>A. Mengozzi, Neo-Aramaic and the So-called Decay of Ergativity in Kurdish, in: Proceedings of the 10th Meeting of Hamito-Semitic (Afroasiatic) Linguistics (Florence, 18\u201320 April 2005), Dipartamento di Linguistica Universit\u00e0 di Firenze 2005, pp. 239\u2013256.</ref> To note, [[Aramaic]] has historically been a nominative-accusative language.<ref>Khan, Geoffrey. 1999. A Grammar of Neo-Aramaic: The Dialect of the Jews of Arbel. Leiden: Brill. </ref> \n\n===Sign languages===\nSign languages (for example, [[Nepalese Sign Language#NSL Morhosyntax|Nepali Sign Language]]) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of [[Actant#In linguistics|actant]] incorporation in verbs.<ref>MW Morgan (2009) Cross-Linguistic Typology of Argument Encoding in Sign Language Verbal Morphology. Paper presented at Association of Linguistic Typology, Berkeley</ref> In [[sign language]]s that have been studied, [[classifier handshape]]s are incorporated into verbs, indicating the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of [[intransitive verb]]s when incorporated, and the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verb]]s. (If we follow the \"[[semantic phonology]]\" model proposed by [[William Stokoe]] (1991)<ref>William Stokoe (1991) Semantic Phonology. Sign Language Studies, 71 ,107\u2013114.</ref> this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in [[Nepali Sign Language]] the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a [[manual alphabet]] handshape \u091a /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word TEA \u091a\u093f\u092f\u093e /chiya:/) being incorporated as the [[Object (grammar)|object]].)\n\n==Approximations of ergativity in English==\n\nEnglish has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix \"-ee\" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:\n\n:\"John has retired\" \u2192 \"John is a retiree\"\n:\"John has escaped\" \u2192 \"John is an escapee\"\n\nHowever, with a transitive verb, adding \"-ee\" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:\n\n:\"Susie employs Mike\" \u2192 \"Mike is an employee\"\n:\"Mike has appointed Susie\" \u2192 \"Susie is an appointee\"\n\nEtymologically, the sense in which \"-ee\" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French [[past participle]]s in \"-\u00e9\". This is still the prevalent sense in [[British English]]: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American [[neologism|coinage]]s and all except \"escapee\" are still marked as \"chiefly U.S.\" by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\nEnglish also has a number of so-called [[ergative verb]]s, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.\n\nWhen English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition \"of\" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with \"of\"). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with \"by\" as in a passive construction):\n\n:\"(a dentist) extracts a tooth\" \u2192 \"the extraction of a tooth (by a dentist)\"\n:\"(I/The editor) revised the essay\" \u2192 \"(my/the editor's) revision of the essay\"\n:\"(I was surprised that) the water boiled\" \u2192 \"(I was surprised at) the boiling of the water\"\n:\"I departed on time (so I could catch the plane)\" \u2192 \"My timely departure (allowed me to catch the plane)\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[Absolutive case]]\n*[[Austronesian alignment]]\n*[[Ergative case]]\n*[[Ergative verb]]\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*[[Split ergativity]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)]]\n*[[Unaccusative verb]]\n*[[Unergative verb]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book| title = Searching for Aboriginal Languages: Memoirs of a Field Worker\n | last = Dixon | first = R.

'til You Drop!]]'', as well as for the ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' movie soundtrack, which was originally scheduled to include several Presley tracks, the A-Teens picking it for inclusion in the soundtrack. It was later also featured as a bonus track on their third studio album, ''[[New Arrival]]'' for the European market. The video had thus tremendous exposure on several television channels, with the A-Teens eventually including the song in their third album. As a result, the song had two music videos, one to promote the Disney movie, the other for the album.

It was later also featured as a bonus track on their third studio album, ''[[New Arrival]]'' for the European market. The video had thus tremendous exposure on several television channels, with the A-Teens eventually including the song in their third album. As a result, the song had two music videos, one to promote the Disney movie, the other for the album.

Today he is remembered mostly for his still lifes, a genre he popularized in 1620s [[Madrid]].\n\n== Life ==\nJuan van der Hamen was baptized on 8 April 1596 in Madrid, therefore, he must have been born there just days before that date. He was the son of Jan van der Hamen, a Flemish courtier, who had moved to Madrid from [[Brussels]] before 1586, and Dorotea Witman G\u00f3mez de Le\u00f3n, a half-Flemish mother of noble Toledan ancestry.<ref>\"Juan Van der Hamen y Le\u00f3n & the Court of Madrid\": William B Jordan, p.46</ref> Van der Hamen and his two brothers Pedro and Lorenzo (both of whom were writers) emphasized their Spanish roots by using all or part of their maternal grandmother's family name, G\u00f3mez de Le\u00f3n.<ref>\"Juan Van der Hamen y Le\u00f3n & the Court of Madrid\": William B Jordan, p.48</ref>\nThe painter's father, Jan van der Hamen, had come to [[Spain]], as an archer, to the court of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] where he settled, married, and his children were born. According to 18th-century sources, the artist's father had also been a painter, but there is no evidence for this.\nJuan van der Hamen inherited his father's honorary positions at court and also served as unsalaried painter of the king. Van der Hamen's artistic activity in the service of the crown is first recorded on 10 September 1619, when he was paid for painting a still life for the country palace of [[El Pardo]], to the north of Madrid.\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Juan van der Hamen - Stiil life with flowers, articholes cherries and glass, 1627, Prado.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Still life with flowers, artichokes and glassware, 1627 [[Museo del Prado]]]]\nNoted for his versatility, Juan van der Hamen painted religious history paintings; allegories, landscapes, low-life subjects, portraits and still lifes but the last two categories brought him the greatest fame. He served at the courts of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and established the popularity of the new genre of still life in Madrid in the 1620s.\n\nA prolific artist, van der Hamen painted all his works during the first decade of the reign of Philip IV. It is known that he painted more still lifes in 1622 than in any other period of his life.\n\nHe also reached great personal fame as a portraitist, being this field, the one that provided him with greater personal success, since still life was considered a lesser genre. He executed a portrait of Philip IV and worked during the 1620s in a series of portraits of the principal intellectuals and writers of his time, including: [[Lope de Vega]], [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]], [[Jose de Valdivieso]], [[Juan P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]] and [[Francisco de Rioja]]. On van der Hamen's death, twenty of these portraits were inventoried as a single item among his belongings. The portrait of his older brother, Lorenzo van der Hamen, probably belonged to this series. The series itself was a focal point for philosophic speculation on the art of portraiture by some of the most distinguished minds of the time, who frequently praised Juan van der Hamen in verse and prose.\n\nAmong Van der Hamen portraits, there is one of a dwarf, painted around 1623 in a powerful naturalistic style. This painting (Madrid, [[Museo del Prado]]) anticipated the later made by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]].\n\nIn 1626, van der Hamen painted cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]], after a previous portrait by Vel\u00e1zquez had failed to please the sitter. Well satisfied with his work Cardinal Barberini acquired three further works from him.\n\nAs a religious painter Juan van der Hamen worked for several religious institutions in and around Madrid and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], like the [[Monastery of the Descalzas Reales, Madrid|Monastery of the Descalzas Reales]], in Madrid, for which he painted altars. Few of these paintings are extant. The best surviving examples of his religious work are in the cloister of the [[Royal Convent of La Encarnaci\u00f3n]] in Madrid, painted in 1625 in a naturalistic tenebristic style.\n\n[[File:Juan van der Hamne- Offering a Flora, 1627, Prado..jpg|thumb|210px|right|Offering to Flora, 1627 [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]\nJuan van der Hamen was also a pioneer in the field of flower painting. Van der Hamen probably began painting floral arrangements in response to the flower pieces of Flemish artists, such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], who were regarded as exemplary masters in the field and whose works were much sought after in Spain.\n\nOne good example of his work as a flower painter is his ''Offering to Flora'',<ref>''Offering to Flora'' is in [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum, Madrid]]</ref> a visual poem that parallels the lyric verse of his time, in which he united his skills as portraitist and flower painter to produce one of the most beautiful paintings of the allegory of spring. The large canvas, painted in 1627, shows the goddess of the flowers seated besides a cornucopia of spring flowers. The painting adopts a Flemish compositional type and reveals an interest in the play of light on iridescent fabrics that probably derived in the style of  [[Juan Bautista Maino]]. The offering to Flora and the pair of paintings ''Still Life with a Vase of'' ''Flowers and a Dog'' and ''Still Life with a Vase of Flowers and a Puppy'' formed part of the interior decoration of [[Jean de Croy]]'s palace in Madrid. Jean de Croy, conde de Solre and [[Diego Felipez de Guzm\u00e1n, Marquis of Legan\u00e9s|Diego Mexia, marqu\u00e9s de Legan\u00e9s]], were Van der Hamen's greatest patrons.\n\nJuan van der Hamen died in Madrid on 28 March 1631, when he was only thirty five years old. His paintings are exhibited today in leading European and American museums.\n\nIn 2006 The [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the Dallas, Meadows Museum of Art held the exhibition:  Juan van der Hamen y Le\u00f3n and the Court of Madrid, gathering Van der Hamen's paintings from Museums around the World and bringing his work to the limelight.\n\n== Still lifes ==\nVan der Hamen is well known as a gifted still life painter of the Spanish Golden Age, but during his lifetime he was most esteemed by his peers for his versatility\u2014for his portraits, allegories, landscapes, flower paintings, and large-scale works for churches and convents. Today he is remembered mostly for his still lifes.\n\nThe still life, which had often been considered a minor genre, flourished throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In Spain, this particular subject matter was termed bodeg\u00f3n and depicted in an austere gloomy style (tenebrismo). Van der Hamen was considered as the greatest Spanish still life painter of the seventeenth century, when that form was revived as a worthy subject in and of itself rather than as an adjunct to a symbolic or narrative work.\n\n[[File:Juan van der Hamen -Still Life with artichokes, figs, cherries peaches and apples, 1629.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Still life with artichokes, figs peaches and apples, 1627]]\nVan der Hamen's still lifes are painted in a style markedly Flemish but they reflect the strong influence of those painted at the beginning of the seventeenth century in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] by [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n]], in which fruits and vegetables are often shown suspended  from a window frame or arrange along a ledge. Van der Hamen adapted S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n compositional style to the conditions of cosmopolitan life in Madrid, using more elaborate objects and foods compositions and objects ranging elaborate confessions, imported Venetian crystals and ceramic vessels along a simple shelf. The objects are silhouetted against a dark background and caught in a powerful light. Their regular, zigzag arrangements and the strong shadows falling on the shelf result in a placid sense of space that is heightened by the impression given by the wafers extending beyond the edge of the shelf towards the viewer.\n\nFrom 1626 on wards, Van der Hamen made his still lifes more varied and complex than his early ones by placing objects on different levels. This type of composition seems to have originated in Rome during the early 1620s and is seen in works attributed to [[Tomasso Salini]] and [[Agostino Verrocchi]]. However, van der Hamen's use of this scheme differs from that of the Roman painters, who liked to scatter a profusion of inanimate objects over the surface. Van der Hamen drastically reduces the number of elements and arranges the remainder into exquisitely balanced, asymmetrical compositions, strongly lit in the Spanish manner. This allows him to concentrate on the rendering of each individual object and thus to enhance the sensation of corporeality and texture. \nJuan van der Hamen still lifes exerted a great influence in his contemporaries like Francisco and Juan de [[Zurbar\u00e1n]], father and son and in later painters as Antonio Ponce and Juan Arellano.\n\nOne of the features of Van der Hamen's still life painting for which he was best known lay in the depiction of expensive luxury glassware, such as the pieces represented here.\n\nConcerned simply with the harmonious arrangement of objects and the accurate representation of texture and light, Van der Hamen  arranged the objects represented in geometrical compositions, circles and spheres play. In contrast with the geometric severity of the setting, the artist arranged the objects on stepped stone ledges, thus varying their distances from the light source. The objects represented, fruits vegetables, wood, terra cotta, and crystal are masterfully described. He carefully calculated the distribution of  color that casts a shadow and, at the same time, reflects the light. The calculated, red in various tones, weaves the forms into a harmonious whole whose simplicity, at first glance, belies its careful structure.\n\nOther Spanish Museums own interesting Works by Van der Hamen besides the excelent pieces from [[Museo del Prado|The Prado]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/artist/hamen-y-leon-juan-van-der/b2d4f6e4-fcc7-4645-a417-1b72b301fa9a|title=Hamen y Le\u00f3n, Juan van der - The Collection - Museo Nacional del Prado|website=www.museodelprado.es|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>.

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]]. The song was the Beatles' first number 1 hit on what became the [[UK Singles Chart|official UK singles chart]] but the second, after \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", on most of the other singles charts published in the UK at the time. \"From Me to You\" failed to make an impact in the United States at the time of its initial release. Instead, a 1963 cover version released by [[Del Shannon]] resulted in the song becoming the first [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] tune to enter the US pop charts.\n\n==Composition==\nLennon and McCartney began writing \"From Me to You\" while riding a [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] heading to [[Shrewsbury]] as part of the Beatles' tour with [[Helen Shapiro]]. The title was inspired by the name of the letters section of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', which they had been reading: \"From You to Us\".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=94}} McCartney noted that their early songs tended to include the words \"I\", \"me\" or \"you\" in them, as a way of making them \"very direct and personal\" to the band's fans.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn his 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Lennon recalled writing the song:\n\n{{quote|We were writing it in a car I think, and I think the first line was mine. I mean I know it was mine. [''Hums melody of first line.''] And then after that we took it from there. It was far bluesier than that when we wrote it. The notes&mdash;today you could rearrange it pretty funky.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=168}}}}\n\nBefore that interview, Lennon had stated, \"We nearly didn't record it because we thought it was too bluesy at first, but when we'd finished it and George Martin had scored it with harmonica, it was alright.\"{{sfn|Beatles In Their Own Words|1978}}\n\nMcCartney also talked about [[arrangement|rearranging]] the song in 1964:\n\n{{quote|\"From Me to You\"&mdash;it could be done as an old ragtime tune&mdash;especially the middle eight&mdash;and so we're not writing the tunes in any particular idiom. In five years' time we may arrange the tunes differently. But we'll probably write the same old rubbish!{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n \nSinger-songwriter [[Roger Greenaway]] recounted a story:{{elucidate|reason=What relevance does this story have with From Me to You?|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{quote|John and Paul were sitting at the back of the coach and [[Kenny Lynch]], who at this time fancied himself as a songwriter, sauntered up to the back of the coach and Kenny Lynch ... decided he would help them write a song. After a period of about half-an-hour had elapsed and nothing seemed to be coming from the back, Kenny rushed to the front and shouted, 'Well, that's it. I am not going to write any more of that bloody rubbish with those idiots. They don't know music from their backsides. That's it! No more help from me!'{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}}}\n\nRegardless, the song was regarded by the Beatles as innovative and catchy enough to be released as a single. This was one Lennon\u2013McCartney song that the duo truly co-wrote; McCartney described it as \"very much co-written\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\n==Melody and lyrics==\n\"From Me to You\" comprises five verses and two bridges. The form is Intro V V B V V B V Coda. The first half of the fourth verse is instrumental. The last half of each verse is a mini-refrain, while the lyrics of the bridges are identical. The verses each consist of a rather short eight measures played in [[C major]]. In the bridge the song modulates to the subdominant (IV) key: [[F major]]. The tonic-subdominant modulation is almost a clich\u00e9, but Lennon & McCartney avoid the clich\u00e9 by going another route from I to IV than the standard I\u2013I<sup>7</sup>\u2013IV. At the bridge's climax, the chord changes are accompanied by \"woo!\" Another characterising element in the bridge is the [[augmented chord]] \u2013 a Gaug \u2013 that ends the bridge and leads back to home key (C major).{{sfn|Pollack|2001}} Lennon plays prominent [[harmonica]] solos during the beginning, middle and end of the song, as he did with \"[[Love Me Do]]\".\n\nMcCartney said of the song:\n\n{{quote|The thing I liked about \"From Me to You\" was it had a very complete middle. It went to a surprising place. The opening chord of the middle section of that song heralded a new batch for me. That was a pivotal song. Our songwriting lifted a little with that song.{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n\nThe idea of singing the song's opening lick\u2014the \"da da da da da dum dum da\" part\u2014was suggested by [[George Martin]], the Beatles' producer. The group thought it unusual but put their trust in Martin. \"In a way, this made [the Beatles] aware of George's enormous musical sense,\" EMI producer Ron Richards later said.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=387}}\n\nIn the song, the singer offers his love to the object of his affections\u2014he has \"everything that you want\". Although the song is based on first-person pronouns, it lacks a lead singer.\n\n==Recording and UK release==\n[[George Martin]] said of the song, \"I asked them for another song as good as '[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]', and they brought me one\u2014'From Me to You.' ... There seemed to be a bottomless well of songs.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=72 \u2013 'From Me to You'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/from-me-to-you-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe recording on 5 March 1963 at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in 6 takes with 7 edit pieces and went without a hitch and on 11 April [[Parlophone]] released \"From Me to You\" in the UK as a single, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the [[B-side]], catalogue number R5015.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=28, 32, 200}} Nine days later, it kicked off a twenty-one week run in the British charts, reaching number one on 4 May, a position it would retain for seven weeks.\n\n\"From Me to You\" featured Lennon playing harmonica in a [[Jimmy Reed]]-inspired blues style he had learned from [[Delbert McClinton]], another American who was on the same bill with the Beatles in the early Sixties. \"It's chiseled in stone now that I taught Lennon how to play harmonica,\" McClinton said. \"John said, 'Show me something.' I was in a pretty unique position, because there just weren't a lot of people playing harmonica in popular music.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n\"From Me to You\" was the first Beatles song to reach number one in the UK and is widely considered to be their first chart-topping song, for although \"Please Please Me\" reached the summit on almost every chart, it was only number two on [[Record Retailer]]'s chart, generally considered to be the most authoritative for the time. \"From Me to You\" would be the first of eleven consecutive British number one singles by the Beatles.\n\n\"From Me to You\" replaced [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]]' \"[[How Do You Do It]]\", a song that had been offered to the Beatles (and even recorded by them, though it remained officially unreleased until 1995) but ultimately rejected by them in favour of \"Please Please Me\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} Gerry & The Pacemakers, who also hailed from [[Liverpool]], were very much rivals of the Beatles in their early days\u2014Gerry and the Pacemakers attained the first number one (\"How Do You Do It\") before the Beatles, and also claimed their second and third number ones before the Beatles did, slowly losing steam afterwards as [[Beatlemania]] launched and the Beatles dominated music worldwide in 1964.\n\nA true indication of how successful the Beatles became thanks to \"From Me to You\" (though it would soon be overshadowed by \"[[She Loves You]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\") was expressed by McCartney: \"The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!\"{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}\n\n==First US release==\nWhen it released \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" in the United States, [[Vee-Jay Records]] signed a licensing agreement giving it the right of first refusal on Beatles records for five years.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=14}} Despite the failure of \"Please Please Me\" to catch on, Vee-Jay chose to release \"From Me to You\"; as a result, it was never turned down by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], because it was never offered to them.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} \"From Me to You\" was released on Vee-Jay 522, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the B-side, on 27 May 1963.{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=17}} Even though ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine called it a \"Pick of the Week\" when it was released, it initially failed even more miserably than its predecessor; through the end of June, \"From Me to You\" sold fewer than 4,000 copies and had failed to chart anywhere.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\nWhen [[Del Shannon]] released a cover version of \"From Me to You\" on [[Bigtop Records]] in June, Vee-Jay tried to stimulate more interest in the original, both by placing magazine ads and by sending out additional promotional copies of the 45 stamped with the words \"The Original Hit\".{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} But the biggest boost to the Beatles' version came from [[Dick Biondi]], who had played \"Please Please Me\" on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in [[Chicago]]. Biondi was fired by WLS in May and relocated to [[KRLA 1110]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in June. He was able to convince his new employer to add \"From Me to You\" to its playlist, and it entered KRLA's \"Tune-Dex\" on 14 July,{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} spending six weeks on the chart and peaking at 32 on 11 August.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=41}}\n\nBecause of the airplay, and resulting sales, in Los Angeles, \"From Me to You\" made the ''Billboard'' [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart for three weeks, peaking at number 116 on 10 August, the same time the single peaked in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} It was the first time the Beatles appeared on a national chart in ''Billboard''.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The late attention in Los Angeles spurred sales of the 45; in the end, the original edition of \"From Me to You\" sold approximately 22,000 copies, roughly three times as many as \"Please Please Me\" had.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\n==Second US release==\nVee-Jay chose to couple \"From Me to You\" with \"Please Please Me\" when it re-released the single on 3 January 1964,{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=22}} shortly after film of the Beatles had appeared on ''The [[Jack Paar]] Program'',  the [[NBC]] television [[prime-time]] version of Paar's previous ''\"[[Tonight Show]]\"'' .{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=90}} Had Vee-Jay known how all-encompassing [[Beatlemania]] would become, it likely would have saved \"From Me to You\" for use as an A-side, the way it did with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and \"[[Do You Want to Know a Secret]]\". But even as a B-side, \"From Me to You\" entered the ''Billboard'' chart on 7 March and peaked at number 41.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The double-sided hit sold approximately 1.1 million copies in 1964.{{sfn|Spizer|1998|p=20}}\n\n==''Help!''==\nAn instrumental arrangement, \"From Me to You Fantasy\" is used in the film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', arranged by [[Ken Thorne]], and is track 3 of the original U.S. release of the soundtrack album. It appears during scenes of attempts to remove the ring from Ringo's finger while he sleeps in the Beatles' communal apartment.\n\n==Album availability==\n\"From Me to You\" made its first album appearance (overall) on the Canadian ''[[Twist and Shout (album)|Twist and Shout]]'' LP in 1964.  That same year, it made its US album debut on Vee-Jay's ''[[Jolly What!|Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage]]''; its first appearance on a \"regular\" US Beatles album wouldn't come until 1973 when it appeared on the [[double LP]] compilation ''[[1962\u20131966]]''.    In 1966, \"From Me to You\" was first issued in the UK on ''[[A Collection of Beatles Oldies]]'', followed by the ''1962-1966'' compilation seven years later.  The first release on CD was in 1988 when it was included in the ''[[Past Masters]]'' compilation. It was later released on the ''1962-1966'' double CD and the single CD compilation ''[[1 (Beatles album)|1]].\n\n==Alternative mixes==\nThe mono version, which was issued as a single in 1963, has appeared on the 1988 issue of ''Past Masters'', the ''1962\u20131966'' CD reissues, the ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'' compilation released in 2000, and ''[[Mono Masters]]'' in 2009. The stereo version was included on the 1966 compilation ''A Collection of Beatles Oldies'', the original LP issues of ''1962\u20131966'' in 1973, and the 2009 reissue of ''Past Masters''.  The intro to the stereo version (recorded on two tracks) lacks the harmonica inserted into the mono mix.\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1963\u201364)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian [[Kent Music Report]]<ref>{{cite book | title=Australian Chart Book (1940\u20131969) | author=Kent, David | publisher=Australian Chart Book | location=Turramurra | year=2005 | isbn=0-646-44439-5}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|1|artist=The Beatles|song=From Me to You|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hung|first1=Steffen|title=charts.nz - Forum - 1963 Chart (General)|url=https://charts.nz/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=46591&pages=|website=charts.nz|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Norway|9|artist=The Beatles|song=From Me to You|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|South Africa ([[Springbok Radio|Springbok]])\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Swedish [[Sverigetopplistan|Kv\u00e4llstoppen Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Swedish Charts 1962\u2013March 1966/Kv\u00e4llstoppen \u2013 Listresultaten vecka f\u00f6r vecka > Juni 1963|url=http://www.hitsallertijden.nl/charts/swedish%20charts/SwedishCharts1962-march66.pdf|publisher=hitsallertijden.nl|language=Swedish|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UK|1|date=8 May 1963|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|41|artist=The Beatles|date=3 January 1964|accessdate=4 February 2020}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1963)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|South Africa <ref>{{cite web|title=Top 20 Hit Singles of 1963|url=http://www.rock.co.za/files/sahits_1963.html|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|UK <ref>[www.sixtiescity.net/charts/63chart.htm#top100 The 100 Best-Selling Singles of 1963]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]]{{snd}}vocal, rhythm guitar, harmonica\n*[[Paul McCartney]]{{snd}}vocal, bass guitar\n*[[George Harrison]]{{snd}}lead guitar\n*[[Ringo Starr]]{{snd}}drums\n:Personnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=77}}\n\n==Del Shannon cover==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = From Me to You\n| cover      = From_Me_to_You_-_Del_Shannon.jpeg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Del Shannon]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = Two Silhouettes\n| released   = June {{Start date|1963}}<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - ISBN 0-89820-089-X</ref>\n| format     = [[7-inch single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock and roll]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=2|s=00}}\n| label      = [[Bigtop Records|Bigtop]]\n| writer     = [[Lennon\u2013McCartney#Lennon\u2013McCartney vs McCartney\u2013Lennon|McCartney\u2013Lennon]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Del Shannon]]\n| prev_title = [[Two Kinds of Teardrops]]\n| prev_year  = 1963\n| next_title = Sue's Gotta Be Mine\n| next_year  = 1963\n}}\nOn 18 April 1963, the Beatles were one of 15 acts to play at ''Swinging Sound '63'', an all-star concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London, England|London]]. They played \"From Me to You\" and \"Twist and Shout\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1986|p=149}} [[Del Shannon]] was also on the bill that night.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} After the concert, he told [[John Lennon]] that he was going to record \"From Me to You\" to give the group some exposure in America.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} At first, Lennon was flattered, but he quickly changed his mind, realising that a cover version by Shannon might hurt the Beatles' chances of having a hit in the States.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} As it turned out, Lennon was temporarily right, but neither artist's version was a big hit in America.\n\nIn early June, [[Bigtop Records]] released Shannon's version of \"From Me to You\" as the follow-up to \"[[Two Kinds of Teardrops]].\" It entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on 29 June, becoming the first Lennon\u2013McCartney composition to make the American charts.{{sfn|Whitburn|p=633}} It spent four weeks on the chart and peaked at number 77.{{sfn|Whitburn|p=633}} It was even more successful in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] as it peaked at number 15 on the WLS \"Silver Dollar Survey\".{{sfn|WLS|1963a}}{{sfn|WLS|1963b}}\n\n\"At that time no one had heard of the Beatles here (the US), but I knew they were great writers so I just picked up on one of their songs,\" Shannon said later.{{sfn|tripod.com|2008}}\n\n===Chart history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1963)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21\n|-\n|Canada ([[CHUM Chart|CHUM]] ''Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://chumtribute.com/63-08-12-chart.jpg CHUM Tribute Charts, August 12, 1963]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|77\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19630727.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, July 27, 1963]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|67\n|-\n|}\n\n==Later versions==\n{{cleanup section|reason=version may not meet [[:WP:SONGCOVER]].|date=February 2020}}\n[[Bobby McFerrin]] covered the song in his 1986 album, ''Spontaneous Inventions''.\n\nIn 1989 [[Kids Incorporated]] covered \"From Me to You\" in the Season 6 episode \"Never Too Old\".

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]]. The song was the Beatles' first number 1 hit on what became the [[UK Singles Chart|official UK singles chart]] but the second, after \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", on most of the other singles charts published in the UK at the time. \"From Me to You\" failed to make an impact in the United States at the time of its initial release. Instead, a 1963 cover version released by [[Del Shannon]] resulted in the song becoming the first [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] tune to enter the US pop charts.\n\n==Composition==\nLennon and McCartney began writing \"From Me to You\" while riding a [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] heading to [[Shrewsbury]] as part of the Beatles' tour with [[Helen Shapiro]]. The title was inspired by the name of the letters section of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', which they had been reading: \"From You to Us\".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=94}} McCartney noted that their early songs tended to include the words \"I\", \"me\" or \"you\" in them, as a way of making them \"very direct and personal\" to the band's fans.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn his 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Lennon recalled writing the song:\n\n{{quote|We were writing it in a car I think, and I think the first line was mine. I mean I know it was mine. [''Hums melody of first line.''] And then after that we took it from there. It was far bluesier than that when we wrote it. The notes&mdash;today you could rearrange it pretty funky.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=168}}}}\n\nBefore that interview, Lennon had stated, \"We nearly didn't record it because we thought it was too bluesy at first, but when we'd finished it and George Martin had scored it with harmonica, it was alright.\"{{sfn|Beatles In Their Own Words|1978}}\n\nMcCartney also talked about [[arrangement|rearranging]] the song in 1964:\n\n{{quote|\"From Me to You\"&mdash;it could be done as an old ragtime tune&mdash;especially the middle eight&mdash;and so we're not writing the tunes in any particular idiom. In five years' time we may arrange the tunes differently. But we'll probably write the same old rubbish!{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n \nSinger-songwriter [[Roger Greenaway]] recounted a story:{{elucidate|reason=What relevance does this story have with From Me to You?|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{quote|John and Paul were sitting at the back of the coach and [[Kenny Lynch]], who at this time fancied himself as a songwriter, sauntered up to the back of the coach and Kenny Lynch ... decided he would help them write a song. After a period of about half-an-hour had elapsed and nothing seemed to be coming from the back, Kenny rushed to the front and shouted, 'Well, that's it. I am not going to write any more of that bloody rubbish with those idiots. They don't know music from their backsides. That's it! No more help from me!'{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}}}\n\nRegardless, the song was regarded by the Beatles as innovative and catchy enough to be released as a single. This was one Lennon\u2013McCartney song that the duo truly co-wrote; McCartney described it as \"very much co-written\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\n==Melody and lyrics==\n\"From Me to You\" comprises five verses and two bridges. The form is Intro V V B V V B V Coda. The first half of the fourth verse is instrumental. The last half of each verse is a mini-refrain, while the lyrics of the bridges are identical. The verses each consist of a rather short eight measures played in [[C major]]. In the bridge the song modulates to the subdominant (IV) key: [[F major]]. The tonic-subdominant modulation is almost a clich\u00e9, but Lennon & McCartney avoid the clich\u00e9 by going another route from I to IV than the standard I\u2013I<sup>7</sup>\u2013IV. At the bridge's climax, the chord changes are accompanied by \"woo!\" Another characterising element in the bridge is the [[augmented chord]] \u2013 a Gaug \u2013 that ends the bridge and leads back to home key (C major).{{sfn|Pollack|2001}} Lennon plays prominent [[harmonica]] solos during the beginning, middle and end of the song, as he did with \"[[Love Me Do]]\".\n\nMcCartney said of the song:\n\n{{quote|The thing I liked about \"From Me to You\" was it had a very complete middle. It went to a surprising place. The opening chord of the middle section of that song heralded a new batch for me. That was a pivotal song. Our songwriting lifted a little with that song.{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n\nThe idea of singing the song's opening lick\u2014the \"da da da da da dum dum da\" part\u2014was suggested by [[George Martin]], the Beatles' producer. The group thought it unusual but put their trust in Martin. \"In a way, this made [the Beatles] aware of George's enormous musical sense,\" EMI producer Ron Richards later said.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=387}}\n\nIn the song, the singer offers his love to the object of his affections\u2014he has \"everything that you want\". Although the song is based on first-person pronouns, it lacks a lead singer.\n\n==Recording and UK release==\n[[George Martin]] said of the song, \"I asked them for another song as good as '[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]', and they brought me one\u2014'From Me to You.' ... There seemed to be a bottomless well of songs.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=72 \u2013 'From Me to You'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/from-me-to-you-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe recording on 5 March 1963 at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in 6 takes with 7 edit pieces and went without a hitch and on 11 April [[Parlophone]] released \"From Me to You\" in the UK as a single, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the [[B-side]], catalogue number R5015.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=28, 32, 200}} Nine days later, it kicked off a twenty-one week run in the British charts, reaching number one on 4 May, a position it would retain for seven weeks.\n\n\"From Me to You\" featured Lennon playing harmonica in a [[Jimmy Reed]]-inspired blues style he had learned from [[Delbert McClinton]], another American who was on the same bill with the Beatles in the early Sixties. \"It's chiseled in stone now that I taught Lennon how to play harmonica,\" McClinton said. \"John said, 'Show me something.' I was in a pretty unique position, because there just weren't a lot of people playing harmonica in popular music.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n\"From Me to You\" was the first Beatles song to reach number one in the UK and is widely considered to be their first chart-topping song, for although \"Please Please Me\" reached the summit on almost every chart, it was only number two on [[Record Retailer]]'s chart, generally considered to be the most authoritative for the time. \"From Me to You\" would be the first of eleven consecutive British number one singles by the Beatles.\n\n\"From Me to You\" replaced [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]]' \"[[How Do You Do It]]\", a song that had been offered to the Beatles (and even recorded by them, though it remained officially unreleased until 1995) but ultimately rejected by them in favour of \"Please Please Me\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} Gerry & The Pacemakers, who also hailed from [[Liverpool]], were very much rivals of the Beatles in their early days\u2014Gerry and the Pacemakers attained the first number one (\"How Do You Do It\") before the Beatles, and also claimed their second and third number ones before the Beatles did, slowly losing steam afterwards as [[Beatlemania]] launched and the Beatles dominated music worldwide in 1964.\n\nA true indication of how successful the Beatles became thanks to \"From Me to You\" (though it would soon be overshadowed by \"[[She Loves You]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\") was expressed by McCartney: \"The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!\"{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}\n\n==First US release==\nWhen it released \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" in the United States, [[Vee-Jay Records]] signed a licensing agreement giving it the right of first refusal on Beatles records for five years.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=14}} Despite the failure of \"Please Please Me\" to catch on, Vee-Jay chose to release \"From Me to You\"; as a result, it was never turned down by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], because it was never offered to them.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} \"From Me to You\" was released on Vee-Jay 522, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the B-side, on 27 May 1963.{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=17}} Even though ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine called it a \"Pick of the Week\" when it was released, it initially failed even more miserably than its predecessor; through the end of June, \"From Me to You\" sold fewer than 4,000 copies and had failed to chart anywhere.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\nWhen [[Del Shannon]] released a cover version of \"From Me to You\" on [[Bigtop Records]] in June, Vee-Jay tried to stimulate more interest in the original, both by placing magazine ads and by sending out additional promotional copies of the 45 stamped with the words \"The Original Hit\".{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} But the biggest boost to the Beatles' version came from [[Dick Biondi]], who had played \"Please Please Me\" on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in [[Chicago]]. Biondi was fired by WLS in May and relocated to [[KRLA 1110]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in June. He was able to convince his new employer to add \"From Me to You\" to its playlist, and it entered KRLA's \"Tune-Dex\" on 14 July,{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} spending six weeks on the chart and peaking at 32 on 11 August.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=41}}\n\nBecause of the airplay, and resulting sales, in Los Angeles, \"From Me to You\" made the ''Billboard'' [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart for three weeks, peaking at number 116 on 10 August, the same time the single peaked in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} It was the first time the Beatles appeared on a national chart in ''Billboard''.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The late attention in Los Angeles spurred sales of the 45; in the end, the original edition of \"From Me to You\" sold approximately 22,000 copies, roughly three times as many as \"Please Please Me\" had.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\n==Second US release==\nVee-Jay chose to couple \"From Me to You\" with \"Please Please Me\" when it re-released the single on 3 January 1964,{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=22}} shortly after film of the Beatles had appeared on ''The [[Jack Paar]] Program'',  the [[NBC]] television [[prime-time]] version of Paar's previous ''\"[[Tonight Show]]\"'' .{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=90}} Had Vee-Jay known how all-encompassing [[Beatlemania]] would become, it likely would have saved \"From Me to You\" for use as an A-side, the way it did with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and \"[[Do You Want to Know a Secret]]\". But even as a B-side, \"From Me to You\" entered the ''Billboard'' chart on 7 March and peaked at number 41.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The double-sided hit sold approximately 1.1 million copies in 1964.{{sfn|Spizer|1998|p=20}}\n\n==''Help!''==\nAn instrumental arrangement, \"From Me to You Fantasy\" is used in the film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', arranged by [[Ken Thorne]], and is track 3 of the original U.S. release of the soundtrack album. It appears during scenes of attempts to remove the ring from Ringo's finger while he sleeps in the Beatles' communal apartment.\n\n==Album availability==\n\"From Me to You\" made its first album appearance (overall) on the Canadian ''[[Twist and Shout (album)|Twist and Shout]]'' LP in 1964.  That same year, it made its US album debut on Vee-Jay's ''[[Jolly What!|Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage]]''; its first appearance on a \"regular\" US Beatles album wouldn't come until 1973 when it appeared on the [[double LP]] compilation ''[[1962\u20131966]]''.    In 1966, \"From Me to You\" was first issued in the UK on ''[[A Collection of Beatles Oldies]]'', followed by the ''1962-1966'' compilation seven years later.  The first release on CD was in 1988 when it was included in the ''[[Past Masters]]'' compilation. It was later released on the ''1962-1966'' double CD and the single CD compilation ''[[1 (Beatles album)|1]].\n\n==Alternative mixes==\nThe mono version, which was issued as a single in 1963, has appeared on the 1988 issue of ''Past Masters'', the ''1962\u20131966'' CD reissues, the ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'' compilation released in 2000, and ''[[Mono Masters]]'' in 2009.

The licence, issued to a company named '''Amalgamated Television Services''', a subsidiary of [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]], was one of the first four licences (two in Sydney, two in [[Melbourne]]) to be issued for commercial television stations in Australia. It began broadcasting on 2 December 1956.\n\nThe station formed an affiliation with [[GTV-9]] Melbourne in 1957, in order to share content. In 1963, [[Frank Packer]] ended up owning both GTV-9 and [[TCN-9]], so as a result the stations switched their previous affiliations. ATN-7 and [[HSV-7]] joined to create the ''Australian Television Network'', which later became the [[Seven Network]]. ATN-7 is the home of the national level Seven News bulletins.\n\n==The studios and transmission tower==\nThe station opened in 1956 with principal offices and studios located at Mobbs Lane, [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] (a suburb about 18 kilometres north west of Sydney). The initial black and white cameras and other equipment was supplied by the [[Marconi Company]] of [[England]]. Conversion to [[PAL]] colour occurred on 1 March 1975. Digital [[DVB-T]] commenced on 1 January 2001.\n\nThe initial transmission tower in 1956 was located near the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] tower at [[Gore Hill]], Sydney. This was eventually demolished after ATN was invited to share a new site at Artarmon which was built by a new 3rd, commercial broadcaster [[TEN-10]].\n\n==Digital and analog broadcasts==\nATN-7 commenced digital television transmissions on 1 January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 6 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 7.\n\nATN-7's Sydney transmissions - both DVB-T terrestrial digital PAL - are broadcast from masts operated by [http://www.txaustralia.com.au/ Transmitters Australia] (TXA) at [[Artarmon, New South Wales|Artarmon]] and/or [[Willou1ghby, New South Wales|Willoughby]]. Retransmission translators to [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channels service Sydney viewers from [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] and [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] and north of Sydney at [[Bouddi, New South Wales|Bouddi]], [[Gosford, New South Wales|Gosford]] and [[Forresters Beach, New South Wales|Forresters Beach]] (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050113090915/http://www.dba.org.au/ Digital Broadcast Australia]) web site.\n\nThe on-air programs are sent by digital link from the Seven Network's national program play-out centre at Docklands in [[Melbourne]].\n\nThe analogue signal for ATN-7 was turned off at 9.00am [[AEDST]], Tuesday, 3 December 2013 by using a special five-minute retrospective clip of the local station and the song \"My City of Sydney\" by [[Tommy Leonetti]], which in the past was played during the channel closedown sequence.\n\n==Program production==\nThe Epping facilities were expanded to provide five operational studios and the centre became the largest producer of Australian produced TV content, including ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'',  ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'', ''[[A Country Practice]]'', ''[[Hey Dad..!]]'', ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]'', ''Terry Willesee Tonight'' and ''[[Home and Away]]''.\n\nThe Epping studios closed in early 2010 when new studio facilities serviced by [[Global Television (Australia)|Global Television]], opened at the Australian Technology Park in [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]].<ref>[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/NEW/NEW27.htm New Channel Seven Studios in Redfern] Architecture Australia, accessed 27 December 2008.</ref><ref>Cummins, C.

Visiting commentators from the United States organised for ATN staff to supply the camera and transmission systems for [[CBS]]' coverage of [[NASCAR]] races.\n\nA variant of RaceCam was also developed for yachts in the [[America's Cup]] off the coast of [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], in 1985. Later in the mid-1980s, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] asked ATN staff to develop aerofoil-designed cameras suitable for [[Formula One]] cars, and these were subsequently used at the [[Indianapolis 500]].\n\n==Seven Martin Place==\n[[File:sevenmartinplace.jpg|170px|right|thumb|The set used for [[Seven News]]]]\n\nThe Seven Network's [[Martin Place, Sydney|Martin Place]] studios, referred to on-air as ''News Central'' and based on the first five floors of The Colonial Building in Sydney are the main news presentation studios for, ''Seven News Sydney'', ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'', ''[[Weekend Sunrise]]'', and ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''. Comprising 3,000 square metres, viewers and tourists can see programs being broadcast from the street level studio. The network claims that the Martin Place facilities are one of the most technologically advanced digital television centres in the world.\n\nEliminations for [[The Mole (Australia season 5)|the fifth season of ''The Mole'']] in 2005 were also held at the Martin Place studios; the set was configured for each elimination episode including the final episode in which the winner and the Mole were revealed live. This meant that guests could watch outside the studio as the eliminations were being carried out live. Notable guests included contestants from previous seasons.\n\n==Seven News Sydney==\n[[File:Seven News cross.jpg|thumb|right|215px|''Seven News Sydney'' reporter Jessica Dietrich reporting outside the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Ultimo studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].]]\n{{further|Seven News}}\n''Seven News Sydney'' is presented from the network's national television studios at [[Martin Place, Sydney|Martin Place]], by [[Mark Ferguson (television presenter)|Mark Ferguson]] from Sunday to Thursday and [[Michael Usher (journalist)|Michael Usher]] on Friday & Saturday.

After Ian Ross took over from both Symonds and Sanders in 2003, ''Seven News Sydney'' became the 6pm ratings leader from February 2005 until 2010.\n\nRoss presented his final bulletin for Seven News Sydney on Friday 27 November 2009 with Bath taking over as main weeknight presenter on Monday 30 November 2009.

The licence, issued to a company named '''Amalgamated Television Services''', a subsidiary of [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]], was one of the first four licences (two in Sydney, two in [[Melbourne]]) to be issued for commercial television stations in Australia. It began broadcasting on 2 December 1956.\n\nThe station formed an affiliation with [[GTV-9]] Melbourne in 1957, in order to share content. In 1963, [[Frank Packer]] ended up owning both GTV-9 and [[TCN-9]], so as a result the stations switched their previous affiliations. ATN-7 and [[HSV-7]] joined to create the ''Australian Television Network'', which later became the [[Seven Network]]. ATN-7 is the home of the national level Seven News bulletins.\n\n==The studios and transmission tower==\nThe station opened in 1956 with principal offices and studios located at Mobbs Lane, [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] (a suburb about 18 kilometres north west of Sydney). The initial black and white cameras and other equipment was supplied by the [[Marconi Company]] of [[England]]. Conversion to [[PAL]] colour occurred on 1 March 1975. Digital [[DVB-T]] commenced on 1 January 2001.\n\nThe initial transmission tower in 1956 was located near the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] tower at [[Gore Hill]], Sydney. This was eventually demolished after ATN was invited to share a new site at Artarmon which was built by a new 3rd, commercial broadcaster [[TEN-10]].\n\n==Digital and analog broadcasts==\nATN-7 commenced digital television transmissions on 1 January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 6 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 7.\n\nATN-7's Sydney transmissions - both DVB-T terrestrial digital PAL - are broadcast from masts operated by [http://www.txaustralia.com.au/ Transmitters Australia] (TXA) at [[Artarmon, New South Wales|Artarmon]] and/or [[Willou1ghby, New South Wales|Willoughby]]. Retransmission translators to [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channels service Sydney viewers from [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] and [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] and north of Sydney at [[Bouddi, New South Wales|Bouddi]], [[Gosford, New South Wales|Gosford]] and [[Forresters Beach, New South Wales|Forresters Beach]] (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050113090915/http://www.dba.org.au/ Digital Broadcast Australia]) web site.\n\nThe on-air programs are sent by digital link from the Seven Network's national program play-out centre at Docklands in [[Melbourne]].\n\nThe analogue signal for ATN-7 was turned off at 9.00am [[AEDST]], Tuesday, 3 December 2013 by using a special five-minute retrospective clip of the local station and the song \"My City of Sydney\" by [[Tommy Leonetti]], which in the past was played during the channel closedown sequence.\n\n==Program production==\nThe Epping facilities were expanded to provide five operational studios and the centre became the largest producer of Australian produced TV content, including ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'',  ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'', ''[[A Country Practice]]'', ''[[Hey Dad..!]]'', ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]'', ''Terry Willesee Tonight'' and ''[[Home and Away]]''.\n\nThe Epping studios closed in early 2010 when new studio facilities serviced by [[Global Television (Australia)|Global Television]], opened at the Australian Technology Park in [[Eveleigh, New South Wales|Eveleigh]].<ref>[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/NEW/NEW27.htm New Channel Seven Studios in Redfern] Architecture Australia, accessed 27 December 2008.</ref><ref>Cummins, C.

Visiting commentators from the United States organised for ATN staff to supply the camera and transmission systems for [[CBS]]' coverage of [[NASCAR]] races.\n\nA variant of RaceCam was also developed for yachts in the [[America's Cup]] off the coast of [[Fremantle, Western Australia]], in 1985. Later in the mid-1980s, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] asked ATN staff to develop aerofoil-designed cameras suitable for [[Formula One]] cars, and these were subsequently used at the [[Indianapolis 500]].\n\n==Seven Martin Place==\n[[File:sevenmartinplace.jpg|170px|right|thumb|The set used for [[Seven News]]]]\n\nThe Seven Network's [[Martin Place, Sydney|Martin Place]] studios, referred to on-air as ''News Central'' and based on the first five floors of The Colonial Building in Sydney are the main news presentation studios for, ''Seven News Sydney'', ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]'', ''[[Weekend Sunrise]]'', and ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]''. Comprising 3,000 square metres, viewers and tourists can see programs being broadcast from the street level studio. The network claims that the Martin Place facilities are one of the most technologically advanced digital television centres in the world.\n\nEliminations for [[The Mole (Australia season 5)|the fifth season of ''The Mole'']] in 2005 were also held at the Martin Place studios; the set was configured for each elimination episode including the final episode in which the winner and the Mole were revealed live. This meant that guests could watch outside the studio as the eliminations were being carried out live. Notable guests included contestants from previous seasons.\n\n==Seven News Sydney==\n[[File:Seven News cross.jpg|thumb|right|215px|''Seven News Sydney'' reporter Jessica Dietrich reporting outside the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Ultimo studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]].]]\n{{further|Seven News}}\n''Seven News Sydney'' is presented from the network's national television studios at [[Martin Place, Sydney|Martin Place]], by [[Mark Ferguson (television presenter)|Mark Ferguson]] from Sunday to Thursday and [[Michael Usher (journalist)|Michael Usher]] on Friday & Saturday.

After Ian Ross took over from both Symonds and Sanders in 2003, ''Seven News Sydney'' became the 6pm ratings leader from February 2005 until 2010.\n\nRoss presented his final bulletin for Seven News Sydney on Friday 27 November 2009 with Bath taking over as main weeknight presenter on Monday 30 November 2009.

It is usually slower than letter post. The development of the parcel post is closely connected with the development of the [[Railways|railway network]] which enabled parcels to be carried in bulk, to a regular schedule and at economic prices. Today many parcels also travel by road and international shipments may travel by sea or [[airmail]].\n\n==Development of domestic parcel posts==\nThe idea of a parcel post may be credited to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In the first year after the establishment of the domestic parcel post in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.<ref name=jones>Jones, Chester Lloyd, [https://archive.org/details/jstor-1820220 \"The Parcel Post in Foreign Countries\"], ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 22, No. 6 (June 1914), pp. 509\u2013525.</ref>\n\n==UPU international parcel post agreement==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-22350-0001, Berlin, Postamt O 17, P\u00e4ckchenverteilung.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sorting parcels in Berlin 1953.]]\nThe international parcel service, which allowed the orderly shipment of mailed packages and parcels from one country to another according to predetermined rates, was established by the [[Universal Postal Union]] on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris during a three-week conference on the subject.<ref>[http://www.scc-online.org/ph02may.pdf The 1880 UPU Parcel Post Convention and Swedish Foreign Parcel Mail, 1881 - 1921] by S\u00f6ren Andersson in ''The Posthorn'', [[Scandinavian Collectors Club]], May 2002.

It is usually slower than letter post. The development of the parcel post is closely connected with the development of the [[Railways|railway network]] which enabled parcels to be carried in bulk, to a regular schedule and at economic prices. Today many parcels also travel by road and international shipments may travel by sea or [[airmail]].\n\n==Development of domestic parcel posts==\nThe idea of a parcel post may be credited to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In the first year after the establishment of the domestic parcel post in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.<ref name=jones>Jones, Chester Lloyd, [https://archive.org/details/jstor-1820220 \"The Parcel Post in Foreign Countries\"], ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 22, No. 6 (June 1914), pp. 509\u2013525.</ref>\n\n==UPU international parcel post agreement==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-22350-0001, Berlin, Postamt O 17, P\u00e4ckchenverteilung.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sorting parcels in Berlin 1953.]]\nThe international parcel service, which allowed the orderly shipment of mailed packages and parcels from one country to another according to predetermined rates, was established by the [[Universal Postal Union]] on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris during a three-week conference on the subject.<ref>[http://www.scc-online.org/ph02may.pdf The 1880 UPU Parcel Post Convention and Swedish Foreign Parcel Mail, 1881 - 1921] by S\u00f6ren Andersson in ''The Posthorn'', [[Scandinavian Collectors Club]], May 2002.

Original airdate: May 14, 2003.</ref>\n\nToby is rather morose, yet he is something of an idealist, often less willing than his colleagues and the president to compromise his political values. He is shown to be a more than formidable opponent in an argument, easily able to hold his own against even Bartlet himself. He is also known for his acerbic wit.\n\nA [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jew]], Toby sometimes attends [[synagogue]] on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], but is not observant of the [[Torah]] and its commandments.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 1.14: [[Take This Sabbath Day]].

Original airdate: February 21, 2001.</ref>\n\n===At the White House===\nBefore joining the Bartlet presidential campaign, Toby was a professional political operative who worked for various campaigns including [[New York City Council]] seats, [[Bronx]] [[Borough President]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] races. However, he had never been on a winning campaign before Bartlet's 1998 presidential bid.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 2.01: [[In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I]]. Original airdate: October 4, 2000.</ref> He says that he backs the candidates who should win, rather than those who will win, and is unapologetic about his low winning record.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 5.20: No Exit. Original airdate: April 28, 2004.</ref>\n\nOnce in the [[White House]], Toby is rewarded for his work on the campaign, with Bartlet naming him [[White House Communications Director|Communications Director]] and senior domestic policy advisor.<ref name=\"Somebody\" /> Later, it is revealed that Toby was not the president's first choice for the job, although Bartlet confides that he is grateful his first choice turned down the job.<ref name=\"Crackpots\">''The West Wing'', Episode 1.05: [[The Crackpots and These Women]]. Original air date: October 20, 1999.</ref> Of all the senior staffers, Toby is the most prone to clash with the President, being unafraid to challenge his judgment and question his actions when he feels Bartlet is not acting according to his true morality.\n\nWhen Will Bailey leaves the president's staff to work for the vice president, Toby interprets the move as a betrayal and develops an antagonistic attitude towards Will that never is truly fixed (they simply go from being constantly at odds to having little or nothing to do with each other, though Will is shocked and left near tears when a devastated C.J. tells him about the shuttle leak and installs him as the new Director of Communications). Similarly, when Josh leaves the White House to run a presidential campaign for [[Matt Santos]], Toby views this as a betrayal and is extremely hostile to Josh until long after. His reaction is eventually explained with the revelation that his brother David, recently diagnosed with terminal cancer, committed suicide rather than live what time he had left: \"He could have had years. But instead he just dropped everything and walked away.\" Toby feels \"walking away\" is what Josh has also done.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 6.16: Drought Conditions. Original airdate: February 23, 2005.</ref> Josh later (successfully) moves to keep their friendship alive, and Toby keeps advising Josh as he tries to get Santos elected president.\n\nToby's oldest friend in the White House is [[C.J. Cregg]], whom he met during an earlier campaign<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 5.18: [[Access (The West Wing)|Access]].</ref> and whom he personally recruited for the position of [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]].<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 2.02: [[In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part II]]</ref> When Toby is fired in Bartlet's final year for leaking state secrets, their close relationship is hit hard and neither reconcile until the penultimate episode of the series and Toby's final scene.\n\nToby accomplishes much in his tenure as Communications Director, including writing both of Bartlet's inaugural addresses as well as his [[State of the Union]] addresses. His most notable accomplishment is \"fixing\" [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] during the fifth season of the show, the sixth year of the Bartlet administration. He thinks of it early one morning, almost resigns after it is leaked by the senator who he is persuading to break with partisan politics, but then fixes it with the help of [[Josh Lyman]]. After C.J. Cregg's promotion from Press Secretary to [[White House Chief of Staff]] in early season six, he also serves as the de facto White House Press Secretary in addition to his role as Communications Director. Toby initially has trouble facing the press in the new role and makes several gaffes, but learns to perform well with the help of new Deputy Press Secretary Annabeth Schott.\n\n===Military shuttle leak storyline===\nIn the episode \"Things Fall Apart,\" the [[International Space Station]] develops a critical oxygen leak. With no civilian shuttles available to perform a rescue mission in time, a three-person crew finds itself trapped aboard the ISS. While the president contemplates rescue options, C.J. becomes aware of the possibility that a secret military space shuttle could be prepared in time to rescue the crew. However, this would involve revealing the shuttle's existence, particularly as one of the ISS crew is a Russian military officer. C.J. shares her speculation with several senior White House staff, including Toby. The information is leaked to Greg Brock, a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which triggers a full-scale investigation.\n\nIn the episode \"Mr. Frost,\" Toby admits to C.J. that he leaked the classified information, which estranges the two. He knew that if the military shuttle's existence became public knowledge, the public would demand the safe return of the astronauts, which is what ultimately occurred. It is implied that his actions are related to the recent suicide of his brother. [[White House Counsel]] Oliver Babish debriefs Toby until his lawyer ends the interview.

The two have a heartfelt reconciliation, with Toby advising her to take a leap of faith when C.J. finds herself at a personal and professional crossroad. Despite strong mixed emotions, Bartlet's final official act as president is to [[pardon]] Toby and thus spare him from having to serve his prison sentence. In the episode \"[[The Ticket (The West Wing)|The Ticket]]\", a flash forward reveals that, at the time of the dedication of Bartlet's [[presidential library]] three years later, Toby has been teaching at [[Columbia University]], or has spent some time in the country of Colombia. Toby has been invited to the dedication by Bartlet and it appears they have moved on from the shuttle leak incident with Toby quietly offering to help Bartlet write his speech for the dedication.\n\nSchiff had publicly praised the show's writers, and creator Aaron Sorkin in particular, for the richness of the characters in the series. However, during the show's final season, Schiff said he felt let down by the writers as some of his episodes were cut \"purely on a financial decision.\" He was particularly critical of the military shuttle leak storyline, which saw his character indicted for leaking classified information. \"Toby would never in 10 million years have betrayed the president in that fashion,\" Schiff said. \"Even if he had, there would have been seven episodes' worth of fights before he did it.\" He justified the story to himself by reasoning that Toby was covering for somebody else.<ref>Caesar, Ed (February 8, 2007).

The role earned Schiff the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2000. For most of the series' duration he is [[White House Communications Director]].\n\n==Creation and development==\nAccording to series creator [[Aaron Sorkin]], Schiff was cast in the role of Toby Ziegler over many other actors who auditioned, including [[Eugene Levy]].<ref>Sorkin, Aaron (2002). ''The West Wing Script Book''. New York: Newmarket Press.  {{ISBN|1-55704-499-6}}</ref> Schiff created a backstory for the character as a widower and wore his own wedding ring, something Sorkin and fellow executive producer [[Thomas Schlamme]], who were planning for the character to be divorced, did not notice until the show's eighth episode. \"I had always imagined that his first wife had died, which accounts for his sadness, and why someone would devote himself to public service and be so singular about it\", Schiff said. \"But then, Aaron and Tommy threw that right out the window.\"<ref>Rohan, Virginia (October 4, 2000). \"'West Wing' player keeps a cool head.\" ''Bergen Record''.</ref>\n\n==Character biography==\nTobias Zachary Ziegler was born on December 23, 1954. He is from a working-class background and grew up in [[Brighton Beach]], in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Brooklyn]], in a [[Yiddish]]-speaking  [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] family. His father, Jules \"Julie\" Ziegler was an immigrant who, according to one episode, \"needed the [[GI Bill]],\" implying that he fought in either [[World War II|the Second World War]] or the [[Korean War]].<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 3.12: [[The Two Bartlets]]. Original airdate: January 30, 2002.</ref> He made women's raincoats for a living; however, before this he was a member of [[Murder, Inc.]] \u2013 the Jewish mafia's enforcement arm \u2013 and served time in prison, complicating his relationship with Toby.<ref name=\"Holy\">''The West Wing'', Episode 4.11: [[Holy Night (The West Wing)|Holy Night]].

Original airdate: February 28, 2001.</ref> His younger brother, David, is a mission specialist at [[NASA]] who commits suicide after learning that he has terminal cancer. Toby also makes reference to a grandfather who lived to be 96 years old, but for the last 20 years of his life \"thought the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] still lived in a big palace in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]].\"<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 5.07: [[Separation of Powers (The West Wing)|Separation of Powers]]. Original air date: November 12, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn Season 4, Episode 19 Toby says that his [[Draft lottery (1969)|draft number]] for [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] was not called. Toby was married to Andrea Wyatt, who serves as a congresswoman from [[Maryland]]. They divorced during the first year of the Bartlet administration after unsuccessful attempts to have children. Toward the end of the Bartlet re-election campaign, however, Andy becomes pregnant with twins.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 4.05: [[Debate Camp (West Wing)|Debate Camp]]. Original airdate: October 16, 2002.</ref> Following this, Toby begins to actively pursue a renewed relationship with Andy. After his initial proposals of marriage are rejected, and imagining that she is making him chase her, he sets about attempting to eradicate the behaviors that Andy has found irritating in the past. He forces himself to eat salads,<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 4.21: [[Life on Mars (The West Wing)|Life On Mars]].

Huck is named for Andy's grandfather, and Molly for Molly O'Connor, a [[U.S. Secret Service]] agent who is killed in the line of duty on the day of their birth.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 4.23: [[Twenty Five (The West Wing)|Twenty Five]]. Original airdate: May 14, 2003.</ref>\n\nToby is rather morose, yet he is something of an idealist, often less willing than his colleagues and the president to compromise his political values. He is shown to be a more than formidable opponent in an argument, easily able to hold his own against even Bartlet himself. He is also known for his acerbic wit.\n\nA [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jew]], Toby sometimes attends [[synagogue]] on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], but is not observant of the [[Torah]] and its commandments.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 1.14: [[Take This Sabbath Day]]. Original airdate: February 9, 2000.</ref> At one point he suggests to [[Josh Lyman]] that, because he is from a Jewish neighborhood of New York City rather than the affluent town of [[Westport, Connecticut]], he is more Jewish than Josh.\n\nToby seems to have a particular fondness for grammatical correctness: he is able to name all the types of punctuation from memory and claims to have discovered a typographical error in the [[U.S. Constitution]] which, he believes, could change the interpretation of the [[Takings Clause]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/property/2006/05/the_west_wing_t.html|title=The West Wing, The Takings Clause and Tom Merrill|last=PropertyProf|first=|date=2006-05-11|website=Law Profesor Blogs Network|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> He attended [[City College of New York]] - he recalls during Season 5 that he had met the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] while a student there.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 5.07: [[Separation of Powers (The West Wing)|Separation of Powers]].

Original airdate: February 21, 2001.</ref>\n\n===At the White House===\nBefore joining the Bartlet presidential campaign, Toby was a professional political operative who worked for various campaigns including [[New York City Council]] seats, [[Bronx]] [[Borough President]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] races. However, he had never been on a winning campaign before Bartlet's 1998 presidential bid.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 2.01: [[In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I]]. Original airdate: October 4, 2000.</ref> He says that he backs the candidates who should win, rather than those who will win, and is unapologetic about his low winning record.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 5.20: No Exit. Original airdate: April 28, 2004.</ref>\n\nOnce in the [[White House]], Toby is rewarded for his work on the campaign, with Bartlet naming him [[White House Communications Director|Communications Director]] and senior domestic policy advisor.<ref name=\"Somebody\" /> Later, it is revealed that Toby was not the president's first choice for the job, although Bartlet confides that he is grateful his first choice turned down the job.<ref name=\"Crackpots\">''The West Wing'', Episode 1.05: [[The Crackpots and These Women]]. Original air date: October 20, 1999.</ref> Of all the senior staffers, Toby is the most prone to clash with the President, being unafraid to challenge his judgment and question his actions when he feels Bartlet is not acting according to his true morality.\n\nWhen Will Bailey leaves the president's staff to work for the vice president, Toby interprets the move as a betrayal and develops an antagonistic attitude towards Will that never is truly fixed (they simply go from being constantly at odds to having little or nothing to do with each other, though Will is shocked and left near tears when a devastated C.J. tells him about the shuttle leak and installs him as the new Director of Communications). Similarly, when Josh leaves the White House to run a presidential campaign for [[Matt Santos]], Toby views this as a betrayal and is extremely hostile to Josh until long after. His reaction is eventually explained with the revelation that his brother David, recently diagnosed with terminal cancer, committed suicide rather than live what time he had left: \"He could have had years. But instead he just dropped everything and walked away.\" Toby feels \"walking away\" is what Josh has also done.<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 6.16: Drought Conditions. Original airdate: February 23, 2005.</ref> Josh later (successfully) moves to keep their friendship alive, and Toby keeps advising Josh as he tries to get Santos elected president.\n\nToby's oldest friend in the White House is [[C.J. Cregg]], whom he met during an earlier campaign<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 5.18: [[Access (The West Wing)|Access]].</ref> and whom he personally recruited for the position of [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]].<ref>''The West Wing'', Episode 2.02: [[In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part II]]</ref> When Toby is fired in Bartlet's final year for leaking state secrets, their close relationship is hit hard and neither reconcile until the penultimate episode of the series and Toby's final scene.\n\nToby accomplishes much in his tenure as Communications Director, including writing both of Bartlet's inaugural addresses as well as his [[State of the Union]] addresses. His most notable accomplishment is \"fixing\" [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] during the fifth season of the show, the sixth year of the Bartlet administration. He thinks of it early one morning, almost resigns after it is leaked by the senator who he is persuading to break with partisan politics, but then fixes it with the help of [[Josh Lyman]]. After C.J. Cregg's promotion from Press Secretary to [[White House Chief of Staff]] in early season six, he also serves as the de facto White House Press Secretary in addition to his role as Communications Director. Toby initially has trouble facing the press in the new role and makes several gaffes, but learns to perform well with the help of new Deputy Press Secretary Annabeth Schott.\n\n===Military shuttle leak storyline===\nIn the episode \"Things Fall Apart,\" the [[International Space Station]] develops a critical oxygen leak. With no civilian shuttles available to perform a rescue mission in time, a three-person crew finds itself trapped aboard the ISS. While the president contemplates rescue options, C.J. becomes aware of the possibility that a secret military space shuttle could be prepared in time to rescue the crew. However, this would involve revealing the shuttle's existence, particularly as one of the ISS crew is a Russian military officer. C.J. shares her speculation with several senior White House staff, including Toby. The information is leaked to Greg Brock, a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which triggers a full-scale investigation.\n\nIn the episode \"Mr. Frost,\" Toby admits to C.J. that he leaked the classified information, which estranges the two. He knew that if the military shuttle's existence became public knowledge, the public would demand the safe return of the astronauts, which is what ultimately occurred. It is implied that his actions are related to the recent suicide of his brother. [[White House Counsel]] Oliver Babish debriefs Toby until his lawyer ends the interview. Toby reveals that he discussed the possible existence of the shuttle with C.J., but does not state that C.J. initiated the conversation. Toby offers his resignation to Bartlet, but Bartlet does not accept the resignation because he must dismiss Toby \"for cause.\" Babish waits with Toby before he is escorted out of the White House, saying that someone should at least thank Toby for his years of service and wait with him to soften the blow.\n\nToby attends [[Leo McGarry]]'s funeral, but sits in the back of the church to avoid press coverage. He is similarly unable to attend Leo's burial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] because of the press circus his attendance would cause. Later C.J. is at an impasse about what to do after the administration's time ends and visits Toby. The two have a heartfelt reconciliation, with Toby advising her to take a leap of faith when C.J. finds herself at a personal and professional crossroad. Despite strong mixed emotions, Bartlet's final official act as president is to [[pardon]] Toby and thus spare him from having to serve his prison sentence. In the episode \"[[The Ticket (The West Wing)|The Ticket]]\", a flash forward reveals that, at the time of the dedication of Bartlet's [[presidential library]] three years later, Toby has been teaching at [[Columbia University]], or has spent some time in the country of Colombia. Toby has been invited to the dedication by Bartlet and it appears they have moved on from the shuttle leak incident with Toby quietly offering to help Bartlet write his speech for the dedication.\n\nSchiff had publicly praised the show's writers, and creator Aaron Sorkin in particular, for the richness of the characters in the series. However, during the show's final season, Schiff said he felt let down by the writers as some of his episodes were cut \"purely on a financial decision.\" He was particularly critical of the military shuttle leak storyline, which saw his character indicted for leaking classified information. \"Toby would never in 10 million years have betrayed the president in that fashion,\" Schiff said. \"Even if he had, there would have been seven episodes' worth of fights before he did it.\" He justified the story to himself by reasoning that Toby was covering for somebody else.<ref>Caesar, Ed (February 8, 2007).

Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized.

Besides the Olympic career of the Soling the boat is used for International and local [[regattas]] as well as for [[Sailing#Recreational sailing|recreational sailing]]. The Soling is managed by the [[International Soling Association]] under auspician of [[World Sailing|World Sailing/ISAF/IYRU]] since 1968.\n\nThe Soling is a strong boat designed for any wind and sea condition by [[Jan Herman Linge]] from [[Norway]] in 1964.<ref name=\"History1970\" /> The boats are [[One-Design#Sailing|one-design]] originating from an authorized single [[Molding (process)|plug and mould]] system and made of [[fiberglas]] This together with a strikt set of class rules makes competition possible on a \"[[level playing field]]\".<ref name=\"Classrules\" /> Solings last long. Those boats produced in the early days are still in competition today (more than 50 years after being built)! {{Quote\n|text=At the 2019 [[North American Championship]] the 5th place was taken by the German team sailing a refurbished Soling build in 1968.<ref name=\"NAC2019\"/>}}\n\nCharacteristic for the Soling is the droop-hiking technique.\n[[File:Silver Soling 2018 Vintage Yachting Games.jpg|thumb|left|Droop-hiking technique demonstrated by middleman.]]\n==History of the Soling <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /><ref name=\"WorldSailing\" />==\n{| {{Table}}\n! Year !! Status !! Description\n|-\n! 1961\n| [[World Sailing|IYRU]] seeks new classes as companion/complement for the Olympic classes\n| The search was for four classes:\n* A companion class for the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]]\n* A complementary class to the [[Star (keelboat)|Star]]\n* A complementary class to the [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] and [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]]\n* A [[catamaran]]\n|-\n! 1963\n| Announcement from [[World Sailing|The Class Policy Committee]] of the IYRU\n| After the announcement, [[Yachting (magazine)|Yachting]] started to gather design sketches for a three persons keelboat to be used in a presentation at the November IYRU meeting. Specs were not explicitly given however the boat should be a \"wholesome boat capable of being sailed from port to port in open water\". What IYRU wants is a nice compromise between maximum speed and maximum seaworthiness stated Yachting. The design of the Soling was made.\n|-\n! 1965\n| A prototype of the Soling was ready and tested\n| After [[Jan Herman Linge]] and [[Finn Ferner]] were satisfied with the prototype (in wood) it was transformed into an plug to create a mould for production in [[Fiberglass]]. At the IYRU November meeting trials for a new 3 persons keelboat were scheduled for 1966. During the winter of 1965/66 the first five fiberglass Soling's were built by Linge.\n|-\n! 1966\n| 1st Trials at [[Kiel]]\n| Spring was used to test the five Solings. The trials were set for Kiel specially to test and compare the entries in heavy weather. The most races were won by an wooden [[Etchells|Shillalah]]. After the trials two entries were recommended by the judges, The Shillalah and, however shorter than the specified minimum length, the Soling. In November the IYRU decided that further trials would be held in [[Travem\u00fcnde]] the following year.\n|-\n! 1967\n| 2nd Trials at [[Travem\u00fcnde]]\n| Some sixty boats were produced, sold and sailed in [[Scandinavia]] as a local class even before the trials took place. Trials were held with some new boats, an fiberglass Shillalah II and the Soling plus an [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]] and [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]] for speed reference. After the trials the Soling alone was recommended to the IYRU. This passed through IYRY unanimously in November and the Soling became an International class. In 1974 Shillalah II also got the International class status. Licensed builders were attracted. The [[International Soling Association|International Soling Association (ISA)]] was established. The first president of the ISA became [[Eggert Benzon]] from Denmark.\n|-\n! 1968\n| Olympic class\n| The Olympic status for the Soling arrived after the [[Sailing at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]]. IYRU decided that the 5.5 Metre had to make place for the Soling in the [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympics]]. Meanwhile, over 300 Solings were built in [[Norway]], Denmark, the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and more countries would follow. The first [[Soling European Championship]] was held in [[Skovshoved]], [[Denmark]] and won by the team of [[Per Spelling]] from [[Norway]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. 75 sailors in 25 Solings did compete.\n|-\n! 1969 - 1972\n| Solings first Olympiad\n| In this period the first [[Soling World Championship]], 261 sailors in 87 Solings did compete, was won, off the coast of [[Copenhagen]], by the team of [[Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]], [[Niels Jensen]] and [[Poul Mik-Meyer]]. <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" /> The team had put a lot of systems and hiking gear into their boat to make it sail faster. One of the techniques was the installation of a double bottom. This in combination with bailers made the boat self-bailing. This construction however was not legal. Before the first race of the Worlds holes had to be made into the raised floor to take away the unfair advantage. Later that year changes were made to the class rules so that racing floors/double bottoms, or as they are called officially \"Cockpit Soles\" became legal. The first winners of an [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Soling gold medal]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1972\" />, [[Buddy Melges]], [[William Allen (sailor)|Bill Allen]] and [[William Bentsen|Bill Bentsen]] <ref name=\"OS1972\" />from the [[United States]] made the boat \"Simple\" by putting a lot of the systems below deck and removing the [[winches]] and shroud tracks. Also the first [[Soling North American Championship|North American Championship]] was held on [[Lake Michigan]] in front of [[Milwaukee]]. 108 sailors in 38 Solings did compete. This event was won by the team of [[John Dane III]], [[Mark LeBlanc]] and [[John Cerise]] <ref name=\"SolingHistory\" />. At the 1972 November meeting of the IYRU the Soling was appointed as Olympic class for the 1976 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1973 - 1976\n| Solings 2nd Olympiad\n| Early 1972 [[Jack van Dyke]] from the [[United States]] became president of the ISA and he made sure that the Soling construction became under control. Then improvements were introduced one by one like hiking vests, mast steps rudders watertight compartments. The Soling became even more a one-design class. 1973 was crucial for the Soling in this respect. [[Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen]], [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] and [[Erik Hansen (sailor)|Erik Hansen]] from [[Denmark]] <ref name=\"OS1976\" />took the Gold medal during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1976\" /> Over 2000 boats were build worldwide. Also due to the progression of the Soling the class was appointed as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1980 Olympics. \n|-\n! 1977 - 1980\n| Solings 3rd Olympiad\n| The Numbers of build Solings stayed high under the presidency of [[Geert Bakker]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Due to the high level of National and local competition the Battle for Olympic selection became more and more intense. This meant that rules were implemented for World and continental championships to keep the large fleet events fair. The introduction of gate starts, and black flag procedures were lined out, tested and implemented. Ken Berkeley introduced [[match racing]] in the Soling. Poul Richard H\u00f8j Jensen, Valdemar Bandolowski and Erik Hansen <ref name=\"OS1980\" />, this time sailing under the flag of the IOC, became the [[Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic Champions]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1980\" /> Unfortunately the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] were heavily hit by the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]]. The Soling was prolongated as the Olympic three persons boat for the 1984 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1981 - 1984\n| Solings 4th Olympiad\n| [[Ken Berkeley]], [[Australia]] took the role as ISA president in 1980. Most new boats were now built by Abbott Boats and Elvstr\u00f8m/Borresens Baadebyggeri with a few but fast exceptions from Bianchi & Cecchi and Bootswerft Leonard Mader. Major champions were held in North America, Europe and Australia. The level of competition remained very high. In 1983 [[Karl Heist]] from [[Germany]] became president of the ISA. The [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1984\" />, [[United States]] were won by the team of [[Robbie Haines]], [[Edward Trevelyan|Ed Trevelyan]] and [[Rod Davis (sailor)|Rod Davis]] <ref name=\"OS1984\" /> from the United States. This event was struck by the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]. Again, the Soling kept its Olympic status for the 1988 Olympics.\n|-\n! 1985 - 1988\n| Solings 5th Olympiad\n| [[Karl Heist]] had two major objectives for his presidency: First he wanted a large Soling event in Eastern Europe. He succeeded in this by having the 1985 [[Soling European Championship]] held in [[Balatonf\u00fcred]], [[Hungary]] and the 1986 Europeans in [[Warnem\u00fcnde]], [[East-Germany]]. The second objective, bringing the operational cost of the Soling down by reducing the number of sails during a championship, took more time. This rule was effectuated in March 1989. <ref name=\"AmendmentGuide1989\" /> This rule change reduced the number of mainsails from 2 to 1 and the number of large spinnakers also back from 2 to 1. Shroud tracks were re-introduced on Solings. The [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] were held in [[Busan]], [[Korea]]. <ref name=\"Sports-Reference1988\" /> The Gold medals were won by the East Germany team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcmann]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]]. <ref name=\"OS1988\" /> The Soling status was prolonged as for the 1992 Olympics as the Fleet/Match racing class. In 1987 Sam Merrick became president of the ISA. In this period much was dune in order to make the Soling more unsinkable by [[Uli Strohschneider]] from [[Austria]].\n|-\n! 1989 - 1992\n| Solings 6th Olympiad\n| This period started with a failed World Championship. This was sailed in Balatonf\u00fcred, Hungary. On the first day there were heavy winds (up to 100km/h), specially during the starting procedure. Out of 73 starters 43 made it to the first mark and only 29 boats made it to the finish! Many masts broke. NO BOATS SUNK!!!! in these extreme conditions. The next days there was hardly any wind. Only 4 races were completed, five are needed to constitute a championship. <ref name=\"SolingSailing1989-2\" /> [[Sam Merrick]] was elected president in 1987. He made sure that although Match racing was introduced for the 1992 Olympics Fleet racing remained paramount so the Fleet/Match race was introduced at the [[Sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]]. Gold was won by the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Jesper Seier]] and [[Steen Secher]]. <ref name=\"OS1992\" /> This Fleet/Match race event was successful and so the Soling remained an Olympic class for another 4 years. Stuart Walker became president in 1991.\n|-\n! 1993 - 1996\n| Solings 7th Olympiad\n| The Soling made the choice to introduce the \"Pumping rule\" <ref name=\"ClassrulesC91\" /> as safety measure. This meant in general that the spinnaker [[Guy (sailing)|guy]] could be pumped unlimited. President [[Stuart H. Walker]] did a lot of work to keep the number of teams in the Match race phase of the Olympics to six thus keeping Fleet racing paramount. The [[Germany|German]] team of [[Jochen Sch\u00fcman]], [[Thomas Flach]] and [[Bernd J\u00e4kel]] <ref name=\"OS1996\" /> won there second Gold medal in the Soling during the [[Sailing at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]]. The Olympic status was prolonged to 2000. \n|-\n! 1997 - 2000\n| Solings 8th Olympiad\n| [[Gy\u00f6rgy Wossala]], [[Hungary]] became ISA president in 1995. The 1997 Worlds in [[Rungsted]], [[Denmark]] did not produce enough races to constitute an valid championship due to weather conditions. Thunderstorms and large periods with no wind at all made it for the race organization impossible to get five race in. The sail plan of the Soling was modified on two points. The tolerances of the mini spinnaker were enlarged so that a more useful spinnaker could be created. Also, the top batten of the mainsail was lengthened so that profile of the top in the main could be better controlled and the lifetime of the sail was improved. Both improvements were initiated by [[Paul Davis (sailor)|Paul Davis]]. [[World Sailing|ISAF]] wanted to make Match racing more and more important at the Olympics. So for the [[Sailing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]] only 16 Solings were eligible to compete in the Fleet race phase and twelve of theme would move on to the Match race phase. The spectacular, popular and many times viewed finals <ref name=\"Youtube\" /> were between the teams of Germany and Denmark. Both teams did barely make it into the Match race phase (resp. 10 an 12 place in the Fleet race phase). Finally the Danish team of [[Jesper Bank]], [[Henrik Blakskj\u00e6r]] and [[Thomas Jacobsen (sailor)|Thomas Jacobsen]] took the Gold medal. <ref name=\"OS2000\" /> During the ISAF 2000 mid-year it was decided that the Fleet/Match race event was prolonged for another four years. However, during the ISAF 2000 November meeting, the Soling was NOT re-elected as an Olympic class. There was no match racing on the Olympic agenda anymore till [[Sailing at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]]. In 1999 [[Tony Claire]], [[Great Britain]] became president of the ISA.\n|-\n! 2001 - 2006\n| Post-Olympic \n| However, the publicity that was generated for the Olympic sailing event by the fleet/Match race event it disappeared from the Olympic agenda for 2004. And the Soling had to face the fact that many of her top sailors disappeared to other Olympic disciplines or quite sailing in general within a few months. Another setback of the class was that Tony Claire was severe injured during a horseback riding incident. [[Rose Hoeksema]], [[United States]] took over as president and did a good job of holding the International and National Soling sailors within the class as good as possible. Worlds and continental events were organized as usual and with sufficient participation. The third disaster struck in 2006 when the Abbott Boats ltd. [[Sarnia]], [[Canada]] went into flames. <ref name=\"Fire\" /> Borresens Baadebyggeri [[Denmark]] however started to build boats in a joint venture in [[Argentina]] to build Solings.\n|-\n! 2007 - 2015\n| Solid International Class\n| [[Johan Offermans]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] became president for an unprecedented number of 7 years! During his presidency he give much stimulants to pick up International travel again. Also, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the class were started. [[Jan Herman Linge]] Died at the age of 85 in [[Asker]], [[Norway]]. <ref name=\"LingeDies\" /> In 2014 [[Peter Hall (sailor)|Peter Hall]] took over the presidency. The 50th anniversary of the class was celebrated during the 2015 World Championship in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Italy]]. Over 135 competitors were present from 14 countries and three continents. <ref name=\"Worlds2015\" /> The first production Soling \"N 1\" was on display at the harbor site. Soling production was renewed at the [[Petticrows Boatyard]], [[United Kingdom]].\n|-\n!2016 - Now\n| Introduction on carbon spars\n| In 2017 [[Michael Dietzel]] was elected president of the ISA. In 2017 it became clear that there were no longer vendors of suitable aluminum Soling spars anymore word wide. [[Han van Veen]], The Netherlands, created and executed a plan to introduce Carbon spars for the Soling. The objective was that the new masts would be cheaper and not lighter or faster than the aluminum masts. The first masts were produced by [[Ceilidh]] <ref name=\"Carbon\" /> in The Netherlands and tested in 2018 they proved to be cheaper and equal to the original masts. The one-design of the Soling remain intact. The new mast were approved by [[World Sailing]] in 2019. In 2020 the Carbon boom and spinnaker pole were approved as well. <ref name=\"Classrules\" /><ref name=\"Boom\" /> In 2020 the [[Soling North American Championship]] in [[Annapolis]], [[United States]], the Friendship League Championship in [[Brazil]] and many other Soling regatta's word wide were postponed due to [[COVID-19]]. <ref name=\"COVID-19\" />\n|}\n\n==Solings Built==\nOver the years about 4500 Solings were built. About 3700 of them were registered. The growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s was high. Then it stabilized.
