The tanker received the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|designation]] '''KC-767A''', after being selected by the [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) initially to replace older [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135Es]].  In December 2003, the contract was frozen and later canceled due to corruption allegations.\n\nThe tanker was developed for the [[Italian Air Force|Italian]] and [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|Japanese]] air forces, who ordered four tankers each.  Financing of the development of the aircraft has largely been borne by Boeing, in the hope of receiving major orders from the USAF.  Boeing's revised KC-767 proposal to the USAF was selected in February 2011 for the KC-X program under the designation [[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus|KC-46]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Commercial Derivative Air Refueling Aircraft===\nAt the start of the 2000s a considerable and sudden increase in their maintenance costs was leading the U.S. Air Force to run a procurement program for the replacement of around 100 of its oldest KC-135E Stratotankers. Most USAF KC-135s are of the updated KC-135R variant. \n\nIn early 2002 the USAF began negotiations with Boeing on the lease of tankers based on the Boeing 767 after it considered the [[Airbus A330]]-based tanker, the KC-330, to be more costly and a higher technical risk.<ref name=\"flight2002\">{{cite journal |journal=[[Flight International]] |title=USA rules out higher-risk EADS tanker proposal and opts for 767 |date=9\u201315 April 2002 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-rules-out-higher-risk-eads-tanker-proposal-an-145821/ |access-date=}}</ref> The USAF said that an assessment of the two types \"shows that the [[Airbus|EADS]] offering presents a higher-risk technical approach and less preferred financial arrangement\". It also said that the larger KC-330 \"does not bring with it a commensurate increase in available air-refuelling offload\".<ref name=\"flight2002\" />\n\nIn addition, the KC-767 has [[aircraft flight control system#Hydro-mechanical|manual flight controls]] with an unrestricted [[flight envelope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finchannel.com/Main_News/Business/59816_Boeing_to_Offer_NewGen_Tanker_to_US_Air_Force_/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002356/http://www.finchannel.com/Main_News/Business/59816_Boeing_to_Offer_NewGen_Tanker_to_US_Air_Force_/ |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref>  The Boeing tanker officially received the ''KC-767A'' designation from the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. DoD]] in 2002 and that appeared in the 2004 edition of the DoD Model Designation report.<ref name=DoD_4120L>[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412015l.pdf DoD 4120.15L, Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles].

Air Force magazine, August 2003.</ref>  Despite other nations engaging in leasing of military aircraft, there was some criticism. U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] questioned whether it is really cost-effective for the USAF to ''lease'' aircraft at all, particularly as the aircraft would probably not have many, if any, buyers when their U.S. military service ended. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has also criticized the draft leasing agreement as fiscally irresponsible. In November 2003, a compromise was struck whereby the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more.<ref>Tirpak, John A.

The tanker received the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|designation]] '''KC-767A''', after being selected by the [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) initially to replace older [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135Es]].  In December 2003, the contract was frozen and later canceled due to corruption allegations.\n\nThe tanker was developed for the [[Italian Air Force|Italian]] and [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|Japanese]] air forces, who ordered four tankers each.  Financing of the development of the aircraft has largely been borne by Boeing, in the hope of receiving major orders from the USAF.  Boeing's revised KC-767 proposal to the USAF was selected in February 2011 for the KC-X program under the designation [[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus|KC-46]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Commercial Derivative Air Refueling Aircraft===\nAt the start of the 2000s a considerable and sudden increase in their maintenance costs was leading the U.S. Air Force to run a procurement program for the replacement of around 100 of its oldest KC-135E Stratotankers. Most USAF KC-135s are of the updated KC-135R variant. \n\nIn early 2002 the USAF began negotiations with Boeing on the lease of tankers based on the Boeing 767 after it considered the [[Airbus A330]]-based tanker, the KC-330, to be more costly and a higher technical risk.<ref name=\"flight2002\">{{cite journal |journal=[[Flight International]] |title=USA rules out higher-risk EADS tanker proposal and opts for 767 |date=9\u201315 April 2002 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-rules-out-higher-risk-eads-tanker-proposal-an-145821/ |access-date=}}</ref> The USAF said that an assessment of the two types \"shows that the [[Airbus|EADS]] offering presents a higher-risk technical approach and less preferred financial arrangement\". It also said that the larger KC-330 \"does not bring with it a commensurate increase in available air-refuelling offload\".<ref name=\"flight2002\" />\n\nIn addition, the KC-767 has [[aircraft flight control system#Hydro-mechanical|manual flight controls]] with an unrestricted [[flight envelope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finchannel.com/Main_News/Business/59816_Boeing_to_Offer_NewGen_Tanker_to_US_Air_Force_/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002356/http://www.finchannel.com/Main_News/Business/59816_Boeing_to_Offer_NewGen_Tanker_to_US_Air_Force_/ |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref>  The Boeing tanker officially received the ''KC-767A'' designation from the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. DoD]] in 2002 and that appeared in the 2004 edition of the DoD Model Designation report.<ref name=DoD_4120L>[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412015l.pdf DoD 4120.15L, Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles].

Air Force magazine, August 2003.</ref>  Despite other nations engaging in leasing of military aircraft, there was some criticism. U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] questioned whether it is really cost-effective for the USAF to ''lease'' aircraft at all, particularly as the aircraft would probably not have many, if any, buyers when their U.S. military service ended. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] has also criticized the draft leasing agreement as fiscally irresponsible. In November 2003, a compromise was struck whereby the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more.<ref>Tirpak, John A.
