It featured numerous musicians such as [[Ai (singer)|Ai]], [[Koda Kumi]], [[Ken Hirai]], [[Kiyoshi Hikawa]], [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]], [[AKB48]] and [[Nobuyasu Okabayashi]] amongst others, paying tribute by singing her most famous songs.<ref name=\"avexlive1\"/>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Life and career ===\nMisora was born {{nihongo|Kazue Kat\u014d|\u52a0\u85e4 \u548c\u679d|Kat\u014d Kazue}} in [[Isogo-ku, Yokohama|Isogo-ku]], Yokohama, Japan. Her father was {{nihongo|Masukichi Kat\u014d|\u52a0\u85e4 \u5897\u5409|Kat\u014d Masukichi}}, a [[fishmonger]], and her mother {{nihongo|Kimie Kat\u014d|\u52a0\u85e4 \u559c\u7f8e\u679d|Kat\u014d Kimie}}, a [[housewife]]. Misora displayed musical talent from an early age after singing for her father at a [[World War II]] send-off party in 1943. He invested a small fortune taken from the family's savings to begin a musical career for his daughter. In 1945 she debuted at a concert hall in [[Yokohama]], at the age of eight. At the same time, she changed her last name, Kat\u014d, to {{nihongo|Misora|\u7f8e\u7a7a||lit. \"beautiful sky\"}}, at the suggestion of her mother. A year later, she appeared on a [[NHK]] broadcast, and impressed the Japanese composer [[Masao Koga]] with her singing ability. He considered her to be a prodigy with the courage, understanding, and emotional maturity of an adult. In the following two years, she became an accomplished singer and was touring notable concert halls to sold-out crowds.\n\nHer recording career began, aged 12, in 1949. She changed her stage name to Hibari Misora, which means \"lark in the beautiful sky,\" and starred in the film {{nihongo|''Nodojiman-ky\u014d jidai''|\u306e\u3069\u81ea\u6162\u72c2\u6642\u4ee3|}}. The film gained her nationwide recognition. She recorded her first single {{nihongo|''Kappa Boogie-Woogie''|\u6cb3\u7ae5\u30d6\u30ae\u30a6\u30ae|''Kappa bugiugi''}} for [[Columbia Music Entertainment|Columbia Records]] later that year.<ref name=anderson>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Mark|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture|editor=Sandra Buckley|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|pages=123, 323\u20134|isbn=978-0-415-14344-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wtkm3O3nWXkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Contemporary+Japanese+Culture#PPA251,M1}}</ref> It became a commercial hit, selling more than 450,000 copies. She subsequently recorded \"Kanashiki kuchibue\", which was featured on a radio program and was a national hit.<ref name=anderson/>  As an actress, she starred in around 160 movies from 1949 until 1971, and won numerous awards. Her performance in [[Tokyo Kid]] (1950), in which she played a street orphan, made her symbolic of both the hardship and the national optimism of post-[[World War II]] Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tansman|first=Alan|editor=John Whittier Treat|title=Contemporary Japan and Popular Culture|chapter=Mournful tears and sake: The postwar myth of Misora Hibari|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai'i Press]]|location=Honolulu|isbn=0-8248-1854-7}}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1957, Misora was attacked with [[hydrochloric acid]], and injured in Asakusa International Theater. The attacker was described as an overly enthusiastic fan of hers.\n\nIn 1962, Misora married actor [[Akira Kobayashi]]. They divorced in 1964.\n\nIn 1973 Tetsuya Kat\u014d, Misora's brother, was prosecuted for gang-related activity. Although [[NHK]] did not acknowledge any connection, Misora was excluded from ''[[K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen]]'' for the first time in 18 years.<ref name=anderson/> She then refused to appear on NHK for years afterwards.<ref name=anderson/>\n\nIn 1978, she adopted a 7-year-old boy, Kazuya Kato.\n\n=== Illness and death ===\nIn April 1987, on her way to a performance in [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], Misora suddenly collapsed. She was rushed to a hospital in Fukuoka, where she was diagnosed with [[avascular necrosis]] brought on by chronic [[hepatitis]]. She eventually showed signs of recovery in August. Misora commenced recording a new song in October, and in April 1988 performed at her final concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nMisora died from [[pneumonia]] on June 24, 1989, aged 52, at a hospital in Tokyo. Her death was widely mourned throughout Japan.\n\nBeginning in 1990, television and radio stations annually play her song {{nihongo| \"[[Kawa no Nagare no Y\u014d ni]]\"|\u5ddd\u306e\u6d41\u308c\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b}} on her birth-date to show respect. In a national poll by [[NHK]] in 1997, the song was voted the greatest Japanese song of all time by more than 10 million people.\n\n=== Museum ===\n\nIn 1994, the ''Hibari Misora Museum'' opened in [[Arashiyama]], [[Kyoto]]. This multistorey building traced the history of Misora's life and career in multi-media exhibits, and displayed various memorabilia. It attracted more than 5 million visitors, until its closedown on November 30, 2006, as to allow a scheduled reconstruction of the building. The main exhibits were moved into the [[Sh\u014dwa period]] section of the [[Edo-Tokyo Museum]], until reconstruction was complete.

Misora displayed musical talent from an early age after singing for her father at a [[World War II]] send-off party in 1943. He invested a small fortune taken from the family's savings to begin a musical career for his daughter. In 1945 she debuted at a concert hall in [[Yokohama]], at the age of eight. At the same time, she changed her last name, Kat\u014d, to {{nihongo|Misora|\u7f8e\u7a7a||lit. \"beautiful sky\"}}, at the suggestion of her mother. A year later, she appeared on a [[NHK]] broadcast, and impressed the Japanese composer [[Masao Koga]] with her singing ability. He considered her to be a prodigy with the courage, understanding, and emotional maturity of an adult. In the following two years, she became an accomplished singer and was touring notable concert halls to sold-out crowds.\n\nHer recording career began, aged 12, in 1949. She changed her stage name to Hibari Misora, which means \"lark in the beautiful sky,\" and starred in the film {{nihongo|''Nodojiman-ky\u014d jidai''|\u306e\u3069\u81ea\u6162\u72c2\u6642\u4ee3|}}.

They divorced in 1964.\n\nIn 1973 Tetsuya Kat\u014d, Misora's brother, was prosecuted for gang-related activity.

She was rushed to a hospital in Fukuoka, where she was diagnosed with [[avascular necrosis]] brought on by chronic [[hepatitis]]. She eventually showed signs of recovery in August. Misora commenced recording a new song in October, and in April 1988 performed at her final concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nMisora died from [[pneumonia]] on June 24, 1989, aged 52, at a hospital in Tokyo.

In a national poll by [[NHK]] in 1997, the song was voted the greatest Japanese song of all time by more than 10 million people.\n\n=== Museum ===\n\nIn 1994, the ''Hibari Misora Museum'' opened in [[Arashiyama]], [[Kyoto]]. This multistorey building traced the history of Misora's life and career in multi-media exhibits, and displayed various memorabilia. It attracted more than 5 million visitors, until its closedown on November 30, 2006, as to allow a scheduled reconstruction of the building. The main exhibits were moved into the [[Sh\u014dwa period]] section of the [[Edo-Tokyo Museum]], until reconstruction was complete. The new ''Hibari Misora Theater'' opened on April 26, 2008, and includes a CD for sale of a previously unreleased song.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u65e5\u672c\u30b3\u30ed\u30e0\u30d3\u30a2 |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=cache:LqQQYTdwLK0J:columbia.jp/company/en/ir/news_release/pdf/080808.pdf |title=Columbia Music Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>  \nA bronze statue of her debut was built as a memorial in Yokohama in 2002, and attracts around 300,000 visitors each year.<ref>[http://yokohama-chintai.jp/03keikyu/hinodechokoganecho/ ]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Monuments ===\nA monument depicting Hibari's portrait with an inscribed poem was erected in her memory near [[Sugi no Osugi]] in [[\u014ctoyo, K\u014dchi]].
