They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.

They dominated much of [[Southeastern Europe]], (as well as parts of [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]]). Several important archaeological sites from this era, including [[Lepenski Vir]] and [[Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo]], still exist near the banks of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Chapman|1981|p=}}{{sfn|Srejovi\u0107|1988|p=}}\n\nDuring the [[Iron Age]], local tribes of [[Triballi]], [[Dardani]], and [[Autariatae]] were encountered by the [[Ancient Greeks]] during their cultural and political expansion into the region, from the 5th up to the 2nd century BC. The Celtic tribe of [[Scordisci]] settled throughout the area in the 3rd century BC. It formed a tribal state, building several fortifications, including their capital at [[Singidunum]] (present-day Belgrade) and Naissos (present-day [[Ni\u0161]]).\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Ba\u010dka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nThe chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and broader) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Ni\u0161), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].{{sfn|Mirkovi\u0107|2017|p=79}} Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.{{sfn|Kuzmanovi\u0107|Mihajlovi\u0107|2015|p=416-432}} The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395, most of Serbia remained under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. The Serbian rulers adopted Christianity in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans finally conquered the [[Serbian Despotate]] in 1459.

Subsequent 1\u20131 draws at home to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] \u2013 another televised match in which [[Francisco Sandaza]] scored his first goal \u2013 and away to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] produced the first points of the season but a home defeat to [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and narrow defeat away to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] left United bottom of the league after five matches. United's third televised match of the season saw them pick up their first league win at [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and was the first of four successive league victories, preceding home triumphs against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]], [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. The run of victories saw first league goals for summer signings [[Scott Robertson (footballer, born 1985)|Scott Robertson]] and [[Roy O'Donovan]], with three [[clean sheet]]s for goalkeeper [[Lukasz Zaluska]]. The St Mirren match was played three weeks after the Inverness match following the death of chairman [[Eddie Thompson]], which led to the match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] being postponed. As the St Mirren match was the first match following the death of the chairman, prices were reduced to just \u00a35, prompting over 11,000 fans to attend and pay their respects with a minute's silence. United failed to make it five league wins in a row when they drew 0\u20130 at [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] but kept their unbeaten run going with an exciting 3\u20133 draw against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] and got back to winning ways with home wins over Aberdeen and Hibernian. A second successive 2\u20130 defeat to Kilmarnock \u2013 this time away from home \u2013 preceded a 1\u20131 draw at home to Hamilton, before wins at St Mirren and Inverness brought United back-to-back away victories for the first time since April 2007. United were involved in another high scoring match against Rangers in a 2-2 draw at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] and followed it up by holding Hearts to a 0-0 draw at [[Tynecastle Park|Tynecastle]], closing 2008 with a home win against Falkirk.\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:25px\">2009 began with a draw at [[Celtic Park]], despite being two goals behind but United's next match saw a 4-0 home collapse against Motherwell, only the club's second defeat in the previous 17 league matches. An exciting 3-2 win at home to St Mirren preceded a 2-0 defeat against Rangers at Ibrox, before draws at home to Inverness and away to Aberdeen. Rivals for third place Hearts won at Tannadice before United won away at Falkirk, with a defeat at Motherwell tempered by a home draw against Celtic. After conceding first at home for the seventh time in eight matches, United came from two goals down to draw with Hibernian, before beating Hamilton for the first time this season, securing a top six league finish. In the final match before the league split, United failed to gain further ground on Hearts for third place, being held at home by Kilmarnock to a goalless draw, ensuring United failed to score against the [[Ayrshire]] side all season. In the first match after the split, United's dominance of the entire match earned a win against Hibernian at [[Easter Road]], before missing the chance to go third after a home draw against Aberdeen. United's final trip to [[Glasgow]] resulted in a narrow 2-1 loss against Celtic, with defeats against Heart of Midlothian and Rangers to close the season.<div>\n{{football box collapsible\n|bg =

Subsequent 1\u20131 draws at home to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] \u2013 another televised match in which [[Francisco Sandaza]] scored his first goal \u2013 and away to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] produced the first points of the season but a home defeat to [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and narrow defeat away to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] left United bottom of the league after five matches. United's third televised match of the season saw them pick up their first league win at [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and was the first of four successive league victories, preceding home triumphs against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]], [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. The run of victories saw first league goals for summer signings [[Scott Robertson (footballer, born 1985)|Scott Robertson]] and [[Roy O'Donovan]], with three [[clean sheet]]s for goalkeeper [[Lukasz Zaluska]]. The St Mirren match was played three weeks after the Inverness match following the death of chairman [[Eddie Thompson]], which led to the match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] being postponed. As the St Mirren match was the first match following the death of the chairman, prices were reduced to just \u00a35, prompting over 11,000 fans to attend and pay their respects with a minute's silence. United failed to make it five league wins in a row when they drew 0\u20130 at [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] but kept their unbeaten run going with an exciting 3\u20133 draw against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] and got back to winning ways with home wins over Aberdeen and Hibernian. A second successive 2\u20130 defeat to Kilmarnock \u2013 this time away from home \u2013 preceded a 1\u20131 draw at home to Hamilton, before wins at St Mirren and Inverness brought United back-to-back away victories for the first time since April 2007. United were involved in another high scoring match against Rangers in a 2-2 draw at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] and followed it up by holding Hearts to a 0-0 draw at [[Tynecastle Park|Tynecastle]], closing 2008 with a home win against Falkirk.\n\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:25px\">2009 began with a draw at [[Celtic Park]], despite being two goals behind but United's next match saw a 4-0 home collapse against Motherwell, only the club's second defeat in the previous 17 league matches. An exciting 3-2 win at home to St Mirren preceded a 2-0 defeat against Rangers at Ibrox, before draws at home to Inverness and away to Aberdeen. Rivals for third place Hearts won at Tannadice before United won away at Falkirk, with a defeat at Motherwell tempered by a home draw against Celtic. After conceding first at home for the seventh time in eight matches, United came from two goals down to draw with Hibernian, before beating Hamilton for the first time this season, securing a top six league finish. In the final match before the league split, United failed to gain further ground on Hearts for third place, being held at home by Kilmarnock to a goalless draw, ensuring United failed to score against the [[Ayrshire]] side all season. In the first match after the split, United's dominance of the entire match earned a win against Hibernian at [[Easter Road]], before missing the chance to go third after a home draw against Aberdeen. United's final trip to [[Glasgow]] resulted in a narrow 2-1 loss against Celtic, with defeats against Heart of Midlothian and Rangers to close the season.<div>\n{{football box collapsible\n|bg =
