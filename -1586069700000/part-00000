In 2000, this proportion grew to 25 percent of their income, while high-income families used less than 5% of their income.<ref name=\"investing\"/> Fully understanding how need and merit (non-need) aid is determined is critical to ensure greater access to higher education. It is clear that at both private and public colleges and universities family income has a major impact on need-based financial aid. As colleges and universities compete for students, the demarcation between merit-based aid and need-based aid is less clear. While there has been a traditional distinction between need-based and merit-based funding, recent trends indicate that these two categories are more blurred than their labels would suggest. Research confirms that merit-based financial aid often takes into account student need and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McPherson | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Schapiro | first2 = M.O. | year = 2002 | title = The Blurring Line between Merit and Need in Financial Aid | url = | journal = Change | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 38\u201346 | doi=10.1080/00091380209601844}}</ref>\n\nControversy has also risen regarding performance-based funding. Performance-based funding is a system in which the state's higher education budget is allocated to institutions by several measures to best determine allocation of funds. This system has been criticized due to the complexity of the measurements as well as the resulting changed environment and goals of campuses. Many have criticized performance-funding, noting an overemphasis of test scores without consideration of other possible measures.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Performance Funding in Higher Education: The Effects of Student Motivation on the Use of Outcomes Tests to Measure Institutional Effectiveness | journal = Research in Higher Education | date = Feb 2001 | first = Jeff | last = Hoyt | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 71\u201385| doi = 10.1023/A:1018716627932 }}</ref>\n\nA 2006 report by Michael S. McPherson and Morton Owen Schapiro indicated that financial aid to students in the 1990s held the strongest correlation with student SAT scores. The report was conducted in the interest of looking directly at the relationship between financial aid grants and various factors, with specific focus on the variables of family income level and SAT scores and minor focus on personal variables, such as race and gender. The reason these factors were given greater consideration was that, according to McPherson and Schapiro, the information was readily available and led to a more meaningful comparison across students than variables like high school GPA. The report also made clear that it ignored the distinctions that universities make between \"need-based\" and \"merit-based\" aid. McPherson and Schapiro argued, \"Although it is commonplace to track the importance of merit as opposed to need-based aid based on the responses given by college and university administrators on survey forms, we have argued that the distinction between 'need-based' and 'non-need-based' student grants is a slippery one.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro 2006\">Schapiro, Morton and Michael S.

New York: The College Board</ref> The findings in the report indicated that \"the principle of awarding financial aid strictly in relation to ability to pay is becoming an increasingly less important factor in the distribution of aid in America's private colleges and universities.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro 2006\"/>\n\nSome low-income students have to work and study at the same time. This may adversely impact their performance in school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarships.com/resources/college-prep/preparing-for-college/why-students-dont-go-to-college/|title=Why Students Dont Go To College |last=Scholarships.com|website=Scholarships.com|access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMost discussions on how higher education funding is determined have focused on the economic and demographic influences; however, according to a 2010 study on the relationship between politics and state funding, political factors influence higher education funding. First, as the number of interest groups for higher education in a state grows, so does the amount of money given to higher education. Second, states with a more liberal political ideology give more funding to higher education. Third, governors with more control over the state budget tend to award less money to higher education. This is attributed to higher education funding being considered to be tradable with other programs. Fourth, a more professional [[state legislature]] correlates with more funding for higher education. (''Professional'' in here refers to a legislature that acts much as the [[U.S. Congress]] does in that members have many staff members and spend more time in session.) Fifth, the more diverse a state population becomes, the less support there will be for higher education funding.<ref name=\"politics\"/>\n\n====When college does not pay off====\nOne view is that college students go to college to develop skills for a lucrative career.

These policies put less emphasis on developing grants to allow students to attend college. Some argued that this approach did not adequately provide aid to those students most in need. There was also a fear that tax deductions or credits would drive up tuition costs.<ref name=Schapiro>{{cite journal|last=McPherson|first=Michael|author2=Morton Owen Schapiro|title=Financing Undergraduate Education: Designing National Policies|journal=National Tax Journal|volume=1|issue=3|pages=557\u2013571}}</ref>\n\nThe federal government also began funding fewer grant programs and more loan programs, leaving students with higher amounts of debt.

Early studies focused on social integration and a person's individual attributes as the factors for degree completion.<ref name=\"chen\"/> More recent studies have begun to look at larger factors including state funding and financial support. It has been found that providing [[Student financial aid in the United States|need-based aid]] proved to increase degree completion in 48 states. There has also been a positive correlation between providing [[Student financial aid in the United States|merit-based aid]] and degree completion.<ref name=\"chen\"/> As the level to qualify for state need-based aid is lowered, the probability of persistence increases. Low-income families now must pay more to attend college, making it harder for them to attain higher education. In 1980, low-income families used 13% of their income to pay for one year of college. In 2000, this proportion grew to 25 percent of their income, while high-income families used less than 5% of their income.<ref name=\"investing\"/> Fully understanding how need and merit (non-need) aid is determined is critical to ensure greater access to higher education. It is clear that at both private and public colleges and universities family income has a major impact on need-based financial aid. As colleges and universities compete for students, the demarcation between merit-based aid and need-based aid is less clear. While there has been a traditional distinction between need-based and merit-based funding, recent trends indicate that these two categories are more blurred than their labels would suggest. Research confirms that merit-based financial aid often takes into account student need and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McPherson | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Schapiro | first2 = M.O. | year = 2002 | title = The Blurring Line between Merit and Need in Financial Aid | url = | journal = Change | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 38\u201346 | doi=10.1080/00091380209601844}}</ref>\n\nControversy has also risen regarding performance-based funding. Performance-based funding is a system in which the state's higher education budget is allocated to institutions by several measures to best determine allocation of funds. This system has been criticized due to the complexity of the measurements as well as the resulting changed environment and goals of campuses. Many have criticized performance-funding, noting an overemphasis of test scores without consideration of other possible measures.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Performance Funding in Higher Education: The Effects of Student Motivation on the Use of Outcomes Tests to Measure Institutional Effectiveness | journal = Research in Higher Education | date = Feb 2001 | first = Jeff | last = Hoyt | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 71\u201385| doi = 10.1023/A:1018716627932 }}</ref>\n\nA 2006 report by Michael S. McPherson and Morton Owen Schapiro indicated that financial aid to students in the 1990s held the strongest correlation with student SAT scores. The report was conducted in the interest of looking directly at the relationship between financial aid grants and various factors, with specific focus on the variables of family income level and SAT scores and minor focus on personal variables, such as race and gender. The reason these factors were given greater consideration was that, according to McPherson and Schapiro, the information was readily available and led to a more meaningful comparison across students than variables like high school GPA. The report also made clear that it ignored the distinctions that universities make between \"need-based\" and \"merit-based\" aid. McPherson and Schapiro argued, \"Although it is commonplace to track the importance of merit as opposed to need-based aid based on the responses given by college and university administrators on survey forms, we have argued that the distinction between 'need-based' and 'non-need-based' student grants is a slippery one.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro 2006\">Schapiro, Morton and Michael S.

New York: The College Board</ref> The findings in the report indicated that \"the principle of awarding financial aid strictly in relation to ability to pay is becoming an increasingly less important factor in the distribution of aid in America's private colleges and universities.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro 2006\"/>\n\nSome low-income students have to work and study at the same time.

First, as the number of interest groups for higher education in a state grows, so does the amount of money given to higher education. Second, states with a more liberal political ideology give more funding to higher education. Third, governors with more control over the state budget tend to award less money to higher education. This is attributed to higher education funding being considered to be tradable with other programs. Fourth, a more professional [[state legislature]] correlates with more funding for higher education. (''Professional'' in here refers to a legislature that acts much as the [[U.S. Congress]] does in that members have many staff members and spend more time in session.) Fifth, the more diverse a state population becomes, the less support there will be for higher education funding.<ref name=\"politics\"/>\n\n====When college does not pay off====\nOne view is that college students go to college to develop skills for a lucrative career.
