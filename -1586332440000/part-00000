I.R.I.S is controlled by neuro-signals enabling the wearer to perform actions programmed by the computer.  After the incident, Ali and his uncle, Bakar cooperate in M.A.T.A missions.\n\nThe series is published in HDTV format and was first broadcast on TV3, on 6 April 2016.  Ejen Ali is the first animation series as the intellect property of [[Media Prima]] Berhad (MPB).<ref>\"[http://www.hmetro.com.my/node/126608 Dunia risikan Ejen Ali di TV3]\" Harian Metro. 30 March 2016. Retrieved on 29 May 2016.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Setting===\nThe series is set in the fictional town of ''Cyberaya'', largely based on the actual town of ''[[Cyberjaya]]'', located approximately halfway between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|KLIA]]. In the series ''Cyberaya'' was shown to be a technologically-advanced city, much as the real-life ''Cyberjaya'' had envisioned. \n\nIn episode ''MISI: MAIN'' Cyberaya was shown to have a [[MRT Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya Line|rapid transit]] [[KLIA Transit|system]].\n\n==Production==\nThe idea of creating the animated series came for Usamah Zaid Yasin, the director and scriptwriter, after establishing WAU Animation in 2013.  For the storyline, he and his team watched films, animated series and read novels about spy and intelligence. The making of Ejen Ali took two years before the production works started in July 2015.  About the name chosen in the series, Usamah said that Ali is a simple name and frequently used in textbooks.  They were confused about choosing a simple name and finally, Ali was chosen.<ref>\"[http://www.hmetro.com.my/node/127283 Fenomena Ejen Ali]\" Harian Metro. 2 April 2016. Retrieved on 29 May 2016.</ref>\n\nAt first, Wau Animation planned to make Ejen Ali as a feature-film project, but because of difficulties securing investment and after discussing with many parties and some feedbacks, they felt that it is a loss if they only produce a single movie as the concept is so wide.  They planned to develop this series at least until 5 seasons, then the films will follow.<ref name=disebaliktabir>The Making of Ejen Ali. [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]]. 1 April 2016, 5.30 pm.</ref>\n\nHowever, they released their first movie after 2 seasons, which was released on 28 November 2019.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\nThese characters are the agents of M.A.T.A (''Meta Advance Tactical Agency''), a secret spy organization that possess advanced technologies and is responsible for keeping the peace of Cyberaya.

I.R.I.S has been synchronised for Ali, therefore only Ali is capable of using it. Therefore, he became a permanent agent and practised as an agent.  He is a boy who didn't excel in class and always came late to the school. He has a best friend named Victor. Ali's weapon is a [[yo-yo]] that can shoot [[shockwave]]. Ali wears Aero boots which are connected to the I.R.I.S to help Ali jump farther. In season 2, Ali invented ATLAS (a device which mirrored the I.R.I.S).

Retrieved on 29 May 2016.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Setting===\nThe series is set in the fictional town of ''Cyberaya'', largely based on the actual town of ''[[Cyberjaya]]'', located approximately halfway between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport|KLIA]]. In the series ''Cyberaya'' was shown to be a technologically-advanced city, much as the real-life ''Cyberjaya'' had envisioned. \n\nIn episode ''MISI: MAIN'' Cyberaya was shown to have a [[MRT Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya Line|rapid transit]] [[KLIA Transit|system]].\n\n==Production==\nThe idea of creating the animated series came for Usamah Zaid Yasin, the director and scriptwriter, after establishing WAU Animation in 2013.  For the storyline, he and his team watched films, animated series and read novels about spy and intelligence. The making of Ejen Ali took two years before the production works started in July 2015.  About the name chosen in the series, Usamah said that Ali is a simple name and frequently used in textbooks.  They were confused about choosing a simple name and finally, Ali was chosen.<ref>\"[http://www.hmetro.com.my/node/127283 Fenomena Ejen Ali]\" Harian Metro. 2 April 2016. Retrieved on 29 May 2016.</ref>\n\nAt first, Wau Animation planned to make Ejen Ali as a feature-film project, but because of difficulties securing investment and after discussing with many parties and some feedbacks, they felt that it is a loss if they only produce a single movie as the concept is so wide.  They planned to develop this series at least until 5 seasons, then the films will follow.<ref name=disebaliktabir>The Making of Ejen Ali. [[TV3 (Malaysia)|TV3]]. 1 April 2016, 5.30 pm.</ref>\n\nHowever, they released their first movie after 2 seasons, which was released on 28 November 2019.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\nThese characters are the agents of M.A.T.A (''Meta Advance Tactical Agency''), a secret spy organization that possess advanced technologies and is responsible for keeping the peace of Cyberaya.

I.R.I.S has been synchronised for Ali, therefore only Ali is capable of using it. Therefore, he became a permanent agent and practised as an agent.  He is a boy who didn't excel in class and always came late to the school. He has a best friend named Victor. Ali's weapon is a [[yo-yo]] that can shoot [[shockwave]]. Ali wears Aero boots which are connected to the I.R.I.S to help Ali jump farther. In season 2, Ali invented ATLAS (a device which mirrored the I.R.I.S).

It is set in [[Porto Alegre]] and follows a young gay man called Pedro ([[Shico Menegat]]) who performs on [[video chat]] using [[body paint]] as his trademark. \n\nThe film was screened at the [[68th Berlin International Film Festival]], winning the [[Teddy Award]] for the best [[LGBTQ]] feature film of the festival.\n\n[[File:Filipe Matzembacher and Marcio Reolon 1.jpg|thumb|right|Directors Filipe Matzembacher (left) and Marcio Reolon (right)]]\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centres on Pedro ([[Shico Menegat]]), a shy young man who works as a performer on a gay-oriented [[video chat]] website. His trademark is to dance while smearing neon [[body paint]] over his body; the film's central conflict is set in motion when he learns that another chatroom performer (Boy25) is imitating him.\n\nPedro arranges to meet Boy25 (Leo played by Bruno Fernandes) and they become lovers, but it is hard for Pedro to trust anyone. He has previously been pushed to breaking point by bullies and whilst his sister knows him well, he has to lie to his grandmother about how he makes money. His mother his dead and his father is not around. Pedro leads a double life in which he is introverted until he goes online and assumes his alternative identity NeonBoy.

He has difficult relationships with his family and the other people he meets.

It is set in [[Porto Alegre]] and follows a young gay man called Pedro ([[Shico Menegat]]) who performs on [[video chat]] using [[body paint]] as his trademark. \n\nThe film was screened at the [[68th Berlin International Film Festival]], winning the [[Teddy Award]] for the best [[LGBTQ]] feature film of the festival.\n\n[[File:Filipe Matzembacher and Marcio Reolon 1.jpg|thumb|right|Directors Filipe Matzembacher (left) and Marcio Reolon (right)]]\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centres on Pedro ([[Shico Menegat]]), a shy young man who works as a performer on a gay-oriented [[video chat]] website. His trademark is to dance while smearing neon [[body paint]] over his body; the film's central conflict is set in motion when he learns that another chatroom performer (Boy25) is imitating him.\n\nPedro arranges to meet Boy25 (Leo played by Bruno Fernandes) and they become lovers, but it is hard for Pedro to trust anyone. He has previously been pushed to breaking point by bullies and whilst his sister knows him well, he has to lie to his grandmother about how he makes money. His mother his dead and his father is not around. Pedro leads a double life in which he is introverted until he goes online and assumes his alternative identity NeonBoy. A real-life sexual encounter goes wrong but then despite losing Leo (who is following his dreams and moving to Europe), at the end of the film Pedro is at a rave and open to new beginnings.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shico Menegat]] as Pedro\n* [[Bruno Fernandes (actor)|Bruno Fernandes]] as Leo\n* [[Guega Peixoto]] as Luiza (Pedro's sister)\n* [[Sandra Dani]] as Av\u00f3 (Pedro's grandmother)\n* [[Frederico Vasques]] as Beto\n\n== Themes ==\n''Hard Paint'' explores the theme of isolation, since Pedro performs online from a studio in his bedroom and withdraws from the wider world.

Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. \nThe charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the [[state of charge]], and cut off at the end of charge.\n\nA trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging.<ref>Phil Weicker, ''A Systems Approach to Lithium-Ion Battery Management'',Artech House, 2013 {{ISBN|1608076598}} page 26 </ref>\n\nSlow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.\n\n==C-rate==\n{{see also|Battery (electricity)#C rate}}\nCharge and discharge rates are often given as ''C'' or ''C-rate'', which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is [[hour|h]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.\n\nFor example, for a battery with a capacity of 500&nbsp;mAh, a discharge rate of 5000&nbsp;mA (i.e., 5&nbsp;A) corresponds to a C-rate of 10 (per hour), meaning that such a current can discharge 10 such batteries in one hour. Likewise, for the same battery a charge current of 250&nbsp;mA corresponds to a C-rate of 1/2 (per hour), meaning that this current will increase the state of charge of this battery by 50% in one hour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |title= A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications MIT Electric Vehicle Team  |website= [[mit.edu|web.mit.edu]] |date= December 2008 |accessdate= May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the unit of the C-rate is typically implied, some care is required when using it to avoid confusing it with the battery's capacity to store a charge, which in the [[International System of Units|SI]] has unit [[coulomb]] with unit symbol ''C''.\n\nIf both the (dis)charge current and the battery capacity in the C-rate ratio is multiplied by the battery voltage, the C-rate becomes a ratio of the (dis)charge power to the battery's energy capacity. For example, when the 100&nbsp;kWh battery in a [[Tesla Model S]] P100D is undergoing [[Tesla supercharger|supercharging]] at 120&nbsp;kW the C-rate is 1.2 (per hour) and when that battery delivers its maximum power of 451&nbsp;kW, its C-rate is 4.51 (per hour).\n\nAll charging and discharging of batteries generates internal heat, and the amount of heat generated is roughly proportional to the current involved (a battery's current state of charge, condition / history, etc. are also factors).  As some batteries reach their full charge, cooling may also be observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf| format=[[PDF]] |title=LM2576,LM3420,LP2951,LP2952 Battery Charging |website= [[ti.com|www.ti.com]] [date=July 2018 |accessdate= July 29, 2018}}</ref> Battery cells which have been built to allow higher C-rates than usual must make provision for increased heating. But high C-ratings are attractive to end users because such batteries can be charged more quickly, and produce higher current output in use.  High C-rates typically require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and so damage to the cells. Such high charging rates are possible only with some battery types. Others will be damaged or possibly overheat or catch fire. Some batteries may even explode. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For example, an automobile SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) lead-acid battery carries [[Lead\u2013acid battery#Risk of explosion|several risks of explosion]].\n\n==Type==\n\n===Simple charger===\n\nA simple charger works by supplying a [[direct current|constant DC]] or [[pulsed DC]] [[electric power|power]] source to a battery being charged. A simple charger typically does not alter its output based on charging time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there are tradeoffs. Typically, a carefully designed simple charger takes longer to charge a battery because it is set to use a lower (i.e., safer) charging rate. Even so, many batteries left on a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers also vary in that they can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current, to the battery.\n\nSimple AC-powered battery chargers usually have much higher [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current and ripple voltage]] than other kinds of battery chargers because they are inexpensively designed and built.  Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.  The maximum ripple current for a typical 12{{nbsp}}V 100{{nbsp}}Ah [[VRLA battery]] is 5 amps. As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged VRLA battery will be within 3% of the life of a constant DC-charged battery.<ref>\n[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Effects%20of%20AC%20Ripple%20Current%20on%20VRLA%20Battery%20Life.pdf \"Effects of AC Ripple Current on VRLA Battery Life\"]\nby Emerson Network Power\n</ref>\n\n===Fast charger===\nFast chargers make use of control circuitry to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging any of the cells in the battery. The control circuitry can be built into the battery (generally for each cell) or in the external charging unit, or split between both. Most such chargers have a [[cooling fan]] to help keep the temperature of the cells at safe levels. Most fast chargers are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry.\n\n===Three stage charger===\nTo accelerate the charging time and provide continuous charging, an intelligent charger attempts to detect the state of charge and condition of the battery and applies a 3-stage charging scheme. The following description assumes a sealed lead acid traction battery at 25{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. The first stage is referred to as \"bulk absorption\";  the charging current will be held high and constant and is limited by the capacity of the charger. When the voltage on the battery reaches its outgassing voltage (2.22 volts per cell) the charger switches to the second stage and the voltage is held constant (2.40 volts per cell). The delivered current will decline at the maintained voltage, and when the current reaches less than 0.005C the charger enters its third stage and the charger output will be held constant at 2.25 volts per cell. In the third stage, the charging current is very small 0.005C and at this voltage the battery can be maintained at full charge and compensate for self-discharge.\n\n===Induction-powered charger===\n{{Main|Inductive charging}}\n\nInductive battery chargers use [[electromagnetic induction]] to charge batteries. A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through [[inductive coupling]] to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries. This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery. Inductive battery chargers are commonly used in [[electric toothbrush]]es and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution. Nowadays it is being used to charge wireless phones.\n\n===Intelligent charger===\n[[Image:Ladeger\u00e4t.jpg|thumb|right| Example of a smart charger for AA and AAA batteries]]\nA \"smart charger\" should not be confused with a \"smart battery\". A [[smart battery]] is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or \"chip\" that can communicate with a [[smart charger]] about battery characteristics and condition.  A smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with (see [[Smart Battery Data]]).  A smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery, and modify its charging actions accordingly.\n\nSome smart chargers are designed to charge:\n* \"smart\" batteries with internal protection or supervision or management circuitry.\n* \"dumb\" batteries, which lack any internal electronic circuitry.\n\nThe output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging.\n\nFor [[nickel-cadmium battery|Ni-Cd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage ''decreases'', which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a \u0394V, \"delta-V,\" or sometimes \"delta peak\", charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.\n\nThe problem is, the magnitude of \"delta-V\" can become very small or even non-existent if (very) high{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} capacity rechargeable batteries are recharged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and to continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases. However, many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems, which are intended to prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases.\n\nA typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM |title=The Great Battery Shootout |author=Dave Etchells}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-powered charger===\n[[Image: Linear induction flashlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Linear induction flashlight, charged by shaking along its long axis, causing magnet ''(visible at right)'' to slide through a coil of wire ''(center)'' to generate electricity]]\nSeveral companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on human motions.  One example, made by [[Tremont Electric]], consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down, such as when walking.  Such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success.<ref>Martin LaMonica, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20076064-54/motion-powered-gadget-charger-back-on-track/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Motion-powered gadget charger back on track].\" Jul 1, 2011.

The DC pulses have a strictly controlled [[rise time]], pulse width, pulse repetition rate ([[frequency]]) and [[amplitude]]. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and [[VRLA|valve-regulated]] batteries.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/913/ |title=AN913: Switch-Mode, Linear, and Pulse Charging Techniques for Li+ Battery in Mobile Phones and PDAs |publisher=Maxim |year=2001}}\n</ref>\n\nWith pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.  In a [[Lead\u2013acid battery]], this breaks down lead-sulfate crystals, thus greatly extending the battery service life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html  |title=Lead\u2013acid battery sulfation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402140958/http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html |archivedate = 2007-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSeveral kinds of pulse charging are patented.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2003088447 |title=\"fast pulse battery charger\" patent |year=2003}}\n</ref><ref>\n\"Battery charger with current pulse regulation\"\npatented 1981\nUnited States Patent 4355275\n</ref><ref>\n\"Pulse-charge battery charger\"\npatented 1997\nUnited States Patent 5633574\n</ref>  Others are [[open source hardware]].\n\nSome chargers use pulses to check the current battery state when the charger is first connected, then use constant current charging during fast charging, then use pulse charging as a kind of trickle charging to maintain the charge.<ref>[http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm \"Pulse Maintenance charging.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309020550/http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSome chargers use \"negative pulse charging\", also called \"reflex charging\" or \"burp charging\".\nSuch chargers use both positive and brief negative current pulses.  There is no significant evidence, however, that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging.\n\n===Solar charger===\n{{main|Solar charger}}\n{{Further|Energy harvesting}}\n[[File:Solar-Charger Varta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Varta]] Solar Charger Model 57082 with two 2100{{nbsp}}mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries]]\nSolar chargers convert light energy into low voltage [[DC current]]. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]], but can also be fixed mount.  Fixed mount solar chargers are also known as [[solar panels]]. Solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid via control and interface circuits, whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid (i.e. [[Automobile|cars]], [[boats]], or [[RVs]]).\n\nAlthough portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications.  Portable solar chargers are often used for [[trickle charging]], although some solar chargers (depending on the [[wattage]]), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.\n\n===Timer-based charger===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe output of a [[timer]] charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity [[Ni-Cd]] cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).\n\nOften a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.\n\nTimer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.\n\n===Trickle charger===\n{{Main|Trickle charging}}\n\nA trickle charger is typically a low-current (usually between 5\u20131,500&nbsp;mA) battery charger or one which has a trickle charging operating mode. A trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2\u201330&nbsp;Ah). These types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30&nbsp;Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers).  Depending on the technology of the trickle charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers.  Some battery types are not suitable for trickle charging. For instance, most Li-ion batteries cannot be safely trickle charged, and the damage caused can be enough to cause a fire or even an explosion.\n\n===Universal battery charger\u2013analyzer===\nThe most sophisticated types are used in critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries).  These heavy-duty automatic \u201cintelligent charging\u201d systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker.  The best are universal (i.e. can charge all battery types), and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too.\n\n===USB-based charger===\n{{Off topic||Off topic|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File: Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket.jpg|thumb|Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket]]\n{{See also|USB#Power|ISO 4165}}\nSince the [[Universal Serial Bus]] specification provides for a five-volt power supply (with limited maximum power), it is possible to use a [[USB cable]] to connect a device to a power supply. Products based on this approach include chargers for [[cellular phone]]s, portable [[digital audio players]], and [[tablet computer]]s. They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of [[USB decoration]]s.\n\n====Power bank====\n\n[[Image:USB power bank.jpg|thumb|right|A power bank with USB cable.]]\n\nA power bank is a portable device that can supply power from its built-in battery through a USB port.  Power banks are popular for charging USB charged devices. They can also be used as a power supply for various USB powered devices such as lights and small fans. They usually recharge with a [[USB|USB power supply]].  The power bank includes a control circuit that both regulates charging of the battery and converts the battery voltage to 5.0 volts for the USB port. Some chargers for cells like 18650s and 26650 can also serve as a power bank.  Although it is generally more cumbersome to carry such a charger with cells rather than a conventional power bank, this arrangement can also charge cells for other uses, and swap cells that are dead.  It also has the advantage that, when the cells are dead, they can be swapped for fresh cells for immediate use rather than having to be recharged first.\n[[Image:Quintezz powerbank, opened.png|thumb|right|Many powerbanks use the common 18650 size [[lithium-ion battery]] which may be user-replaceable.]]\n\nSpecifications:\n* Capacity in Wh: Total power capacity measured by multiplying mAh by voltage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.powerbanktalk.com/best-power-banks/ |title=The Best USB Battery Packs}}</ref>\n* Capacity in mAh: [[mAh]] stands for milli Ampere-hour and measures the amount of power flow that can be supplied by a certain power bank at a specific voltage. Many manufacturers rate their products at 3.7 V, the voltage of cell(s) inside. Since USB outputs at 5 V, calculations at this voltage will yield a lower mAh number. For example, a battery pack advertised with a 3000 mAh capacity (at 3.7 V) will produce 2220 mAh at 5 V.  Power losses due to efficiency of the charging circuitry also occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/portable-power-bank-capacities-gary-explains-699550/ |title=Does a 3000 mAh portable power bank charge a 3000 mAh phone? |publisher=Android Authority |date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* Simultaneous charging and discharging (also known as ''\u201cpassthrough\u201d charging''<ref name=RAV_passthrough2>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2018/06/pass-through-creative-ways-power-banks-charge/ RavPower.com blog article: \u201cHow Pass Through Charging Lets You Use Power Banks In Creative Ways\u201d]</ref><ref name=RAV_passthrough>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/10/danger-and-damage-of-pass-through-technology-for-batteries/ RAVpower Blog article: \u201cWhat is Passthrough Charging?\u201d]</ref>): need to specify if the powerbank's ports can output power while it being charged itself.\n* Number of output [[USB]] ports: This specifies the number of devices that can be charged simultaneously.\n* Output current rating: This specifies the current rating that it can charge maximum. The higher the number, the better the powerbank. This can vary from output port to output port. Also, some powerbanks don't have dedicated high current ports, but will drop the output at all ports if the maximum total current output of the powerbank is exceeded.\n* Input Current Rating: Input current rating is the amount of current the powerbank is able to draw at its maximum level while getting charged.\n* Safety Protections: Over Voltage Protection, Over Charge Protection, Over Current Protection, Over Heat Protection, Short-Circuit Protections and Over Discharge Protections are the common safety measures observed with standard powerbanks.\n* [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] Indications: The Led glows as per indicating the amount of charging ability left with the powerbank. Some powerbanks have a line of LEDs, with the number of LEDs lit indicating state of charge. Other powerbanks may simply have one LED which changes color or flashes when the charge of the internal battery is low.\n* [[Quick charge]] (commonly [[Qualcomm Quick Charge]]) support?\n\nSome power banks have a built-in wireless charging pad. Power banks are available in different capacity ratings.\n\n====Compatibility====\n[[File:Mini, micro and J10 USB connectors.jpg|thumb|Mini, micro and J10 USB charging connectors]]\n[[File:Lightning connector.svg|thumb|Lightning connector]]\n[[File:USB charger with three different charging ports.png|thumb|Australian 240 V USB charger with three different types of charging ports]]\nAlthough a standard exists for USB chargers<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC - Newslog > 2011-02-01: One size-fits-all mobile phone charger: IEC publishes first globally relevant standard |url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2011/nr0311.htm |website=www.iec.ch |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>, there are two areas of common incompatibility.\n* The connector on the device to be charged. There are several current and many obsolete connectors, including:\n**The [[Micro USB]] connector\n**The [[Mini USB]] connector\n**The [[USB-C]] connector\n**The [[lightning connector]]\n**The [[J10 connector]]\n**Various sizes of [[coaxial power connector]], particularly the smaller sizes\n**The [[3.5 mm jack]] and [[2.5 mm jack]]\n:and others. It is essential that the connectors on the device and charger match exactly, so that the correct polarity is used.  Reversing the polarity between a battery and its charger is likely to cause battery failure and even charger failure.  The failures may result in fire or damaged / destroyed equipment..\n* The charging port. This may be smart or dumb, and each in various current ratings. Compatibility varies and must be checked to maximize safety . A mismatched charger will charge more slowly, and sometimes not at all.\n\n==Applications==\nSince a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output;  it is cheaper to make them that way. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering are sometimes termed [[battery eliminator]]s.\n\n===Battery charger for vehicles===\nThere are two main types of chargers used for vehicles:\n* To recharge a fuel vehicle's [[Car battery|starter battery]], where a modular charger is used; typically an [[IUoU battery charging|3-stage charger]].\n* To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack; see [[Charging station]].\n\nChargers for car batteries come in varying ratings. Chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.\n\n=== Electric vehicle batteries===\n\nElectric vehicle battery chargers (ECS) come in a variety of brands and characteristics. These chargers vary from 1&nbsp;kW to 7.5&nbsp;kW maximum charge rate. Some use algorithm charge curves, others use constant voltage, constant current. Some are programmable by the end user through a [[Controller area network|CAN]] port, some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage, some are preset to specified battery pack voltage, amp-hour and chemistry. Prices range from $400 to $4500.\n\nA 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.\n\nPublic EV [[charging station]]s provide 6&nbsp;kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6&nbsp;kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1&nbsp;kW overnight charging.\n\nRapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available AC power, battery type, and the type of charging system.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/09/fuji-heavy-spee.html Fuji Heavy Speeds Up Recharging of R1e EV]. Green Car Congress (2007-09-18). Retrieved on 2011-11-11.</ref>\n\nOnboard EV chargers (change AC power to DC power to recharge the EV's pack) can be:\n* Isolated: they make no physical connection between the [[Alternating current|A/C]] electrical [[mains electricity|mains]] and the batteries being charged. These typically employ some form of inductive connection between the grid and a charging vehicle. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. The battery has a maximum current rating that cannot be exceeded\n* Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection to the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be used in parallel.\n\n[[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.\n\n====Charge stations====\n{{Main|Charging station}}\n\n[[Better Place (company)|Project Better Place]] was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through [[leasing|leases]] and credits until filing for bankruptcy in May 2013.\n[[File:Charge6 3wACin.jpg|thumb|Auxiliary charger designed to fit a variety of proprietary devices]]\n\n====Induction-powered charging====\nResearchers at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called [[Online Electric Vehicle]], OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via [[inductive charging]], (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself.<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ Korean electric vehicle solution].

Older ones are notoriously diverse, having a wide variety of [[DC connector]]-styles and voltages, most of which are not compatible with other manufacturers' phones or even different models of phones from a single manufacturer.\n\nUsers of publicly accessible charging kiosks must be able to cross-reference connectors with device brands/models and individual charge parameters and thus ensure delivery of the correct charge for their mobile device. A database-driven system is one solution, and is being incorporated into some designs of charging kiosks.\n\nThere are also human-powered chargers sold on the market, which typically consists of a [[dynamo]] powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and extension cords. A French startup offers a kind of dynamo charger inspired by the [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] that can be used with only one hand.<ref>[http://www.todaysiphone.com/2013/06/charge-your-mobile-device-wherever-you-are-using-voltmaker/ Charge your iPhone by spinning Voltmaker around like a mini helicopter].

It can charge mobile phone 4 times faster than standard micro USB.\n\n===Stationary battery plants===\nTelecommunications, electric power, and computer [[uninterruptible power supply]] facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in [[battery room]]s) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.\n\n===Use in experiments===\nA battery charger can work as a DC [[power adapter]] for experimentation. It may, however, require an external [[capacitor]] to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"[[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]]\" voltage added to it.  There may be an [[internal resistance]] connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.\n\n==Prolonging battery life==\nWhich electrical practices, and so which charger, are best suited for use depending entirely on the type of battery. NiCd cells must be fully discharged occasionally, or else the battery loses capacity over time due to a phenomenon known as \"[[memory effect]].\" Once a month (perhaps once every 30 charges) is sometimes recommended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full [[charge cycle]]s which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.\n\nMost modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use [[Lithium-ion]] batteries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2bFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Most+modern+cell+phones,+laptops,+and+most+electric+vehicles+use+Lithium-ion+batteries&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj16d2qiI7VAhUW92MKHVbkA7kQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20modern%20cell%20phones,%20laptops,%20and%20most%20electric%20vehicles%20use%20Lithium-ion%20batteries&f=false|title=Energy: Sources, Utilization, Legislation, Sustainability, Illinois as Model State|last=Mansoori|first=G.

As with all battery types, degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures. Degradation in [[lithium-ion]] batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance often due to cell [[oxidation]]. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, if Li-ION cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged, which is why many such batteries in consumer goods now have an \"electronic fuse\" that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level. The electronic fuse circuitry draws a small amount of current from the battery, which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it, and with a very low initial [[state of charge]], the battery may be permanently destroyed.\n\nMotor vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc. have used [[lead\u2013acid]] batteries. These batteries employ a [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]] and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect, though [[sulfation]] (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries, and the old ones recycled. [[Lead\u2013acid]] batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to \"float charge\" the battery.  This prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge, preventing sulfate from forming.  Proper temperature compensated [[float voltage]] should be used to achieve the best results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|Alternator]] \u2013 battery charging device in car\n* [[Electric bus#Charging]]\n* [[Battery eliminator]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n* [[Charge controller]]\n* [[FuelRod]] \u2013 a kiosk-based charging service \n* [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n* [[Recharging alkaline batteries]]\n* [[Solar energy]]\n* [[Solar lamp]]\n* [[State of charge]] (batteries)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[https://mheal.in/ Battery charging problem solution]\n{{Commons category|Battery chargers|Battery charger}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Charger}}\n[[Category:Battery chargers| ]]\n[[Category:Battery charging]]\n[[Category:Rechargeable batteries]]\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|other senses of this term|AC adapter}}\n[[File:BatteryCharger1.jpg|thumb|upright|This unit charges the batteries until they reach a specific voltage and then it [[trickle charging|trickle charges]] the batteries until it is disconnected.]]\n[[File:Simple Charger.jpg|thumb|A simple charger equivalent to an AC/DC wall adapter.

Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected at the end of the charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer, to cut off charging current at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime), over heating or even exploding. \nThe charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the [[state of charge]], and cut off at the end of charge.\n\nA trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Some battery types cannot tolerate trickle charging of any kind;  attempts to do so may result in damage.  Lithium ion battery cells use a chemistry system which does not permit indefinite trickle charging.<ref>Phil Weicker, ''A Systems Approach to Lithium-Ion Battery Management'',Artech House, 2013 {{ISBN|1608076598}} page 26 </ref>\n\nSlow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge. High-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharging. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers. For public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.\n\n==C-rate==\n{{see also|Battery (electricity)#C rate}}\nCharge and discharge rates are often given as ''C'' or ''C-rate'', which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity. The C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is [[hour|h]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.\n\nFor example, for a battery with a capacity of 500&nbsp;mAh, a discharge rate of 5000&nbsp;mA (i.e., 5&nbsp;A) corresponds to a C-rate of 10 (per hour), meaning that such a current can discharge 10 such batteries in one hour. Likewise, for the same battery a charge current of 250&nbsp;mA corresponds to a C-rate of 1/2 (per hour), meaning that this current will increase the state of charge of this battery by 50% in one hour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf |format= [[PDF]] |title= A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications MIT Electric Vehicle Team  |website= [[mit.edu|web.mit.edu]] |date= December 2008 |accessdate= May 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the unit of the C-rate is typically implied, some care is required when using it to avoid confusing it with the battery's capacity to store a charge, which in the [[International System of Units|SI]] has unit [[coulomb]] with unit symbol ''C''.\n\nIf both the (dis)charge current and the battery capacity in the C-rate ratio is multiplied by the battery voltage, the C-rate becomes a ratio of the (dis)charge power to the battery's energy capacity. For example, when the 100&nbsp;kWh battery in a [[Tesla Model S]] P100D is undergoing [[Tesla supercharger|supercharging]] at 120&nbsp;kW the C-rate is 1.2 (per hour) and when that battery delivers its maximum power of 451&nbsp;kW, its C-rate is 4.51 (per hour).\n\nAll charging and discharging of batteries generates internal heat, and the amount of heat generated is roughly proportional to the current involved (a battery's current state of charge, condition / history, etc. are also factors).  As some batteries reach their full charge, cooling may also be observed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva557/snva557.pdf| format=[[PDF]] |title=LM2576,LM3420,LP2951,LP2952 Battery Charging |website= [[ti.com|www.ti.com]] [date=July 2018 |accessdate= July 29, 2018}}</ref> Battery cells which have been built to allow higher C-rates than usual must make provision for increased heating. But high C-ratings are attractive to end users because such batteries can be charged more quickly, and produce higher current output in use.  High C-rates typically require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and so damage to the cells. Such high charging rates are possible only with some battery types. Others will be damaged or possibly overheat or catch fire. Some batteries may even explode. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} For example, an automobile SLI (starting, lighting, ignition) lead-acid battery carries [[Lead\u2013acid battery#Risk of explosion|several risks of explosion]].\n\n==Type==\n\n===Simple charger===\n\nA simple charger works by supplying a [[direct current|constant DC]] or [[pulsed DC]] [[electric power|power]] source to a battery being charged. A simple charger typically does not alter its output based on charging time or the charge on the battery. This simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive, but there are tradeoffs. Typically, a carefully designed simple charger takes longer to charge a battery because it is set to use a lower (i.e., safer) charging rate. Even so, many batteries left on a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging. These chargers also vary in that they can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current, to the battery.\n\nSimple AC-powered battery chargers usually have much higher [[ripple (electrical)|ripple current and ripple voltage]] than other kinds of battery chargers because they are inexpensively designed and built.  Generally, when the ripple current is within a battery's manufacturer recommended level, the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level.  The maximum ripple current for a typical 12{{nbsp}}V 100{{nbsp}}Ah [[VRLA battery]] is 5 amps. As long as the ripple current is not excessive (more than 3 to 4 times the battery manufacturer recommended level), the expected life of a ripple-charged VRLA battery will be within 3% of the life of a constant DC-charged battery.<ref>\n[http://www.emersonnetworkpower.com/en-US/Brands/Liebert/Documents/White%20Papers/Effects%20of%20AC%20Ripple%20Current%20on%20VRLA%20Battery%20Life.pdf \"Effects of AC Ripple Current on VRLA Battery Life\"]\nby Emerson Network Power\n</ref>\n\n===Fast charger===\nFast chargers make use of control circuitry to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging any of the cells in the battery. The control circuitry can be built into the battery (generally for each cell) or in the external charging unit, or split between both. Most such chargers have a [[cooling fan]] to help keep the temperature of the cells at safe levels. Most fast chargers are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard NiMH cells that do not have the special control circuitry.\n\n===Three stage charger===\nTo accelerate the charging time and provide continuous charging, an intelligent charger attempts to detect the state of charge and condition of the battery and applies a 3-stage charging scheme. The following description assumes a sealed lead acid traction battery at 25{{nbsp}}\u00b0C. The first stage is referred to as \"bulk absorption\";  the charging current will be held high and constant and is limited by the capacity of the charger. When the voltage on the battery reaches its outgassing voltage (2.22 volts per cell) the charger switches to the second stage and the voltage is held constant (2.40 volts per cell). The delivered current will decline at the maintained voltage, and when the current reaches less than 0.005C the charger enters its third stage and the charger output will be held constant at 2.25 volts per cell. In the third stage, the charging current is very small 0.005C and at this voltage the battery can be maintained at full charge and compensate for self-discharge.\n\n===Induction-powered charger===\n{{Main|Inductive charging}}\n\nInductive battery chargers use [[electromagnetic induction]] to charge batteries. A charging station sends electromagnetic energy through [[inductive coupling]] to an electrical device, which stores the energy in the batteries. This is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery. Inductive battery chargers are commonly used in [[electric toothbrush]]es and other devices used in bathrooms. Because there are no open electrical contacts, there is no risk of electrocution. Nowadays it is being used to charge wireless phones.\n\n===Intelligent charger===\n[[Image:Ladeger\u00e4t.jpg|thumb|right| Example of a smart charger for AA and AAA batteries]]\nA \"smart charger\" should not be confused with a \"smart battery\". A [[smart battery]] is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or \"chip\" that can communicate with a [[smart charger]] about battery characteristics and condition.  A smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with (see [[Smart Battery Data]]).  A smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery, and modify its charging actions accordingly.\n\nSome smart chargers are designed to charge:\n* \"smart\" batteries with internal protection or supervision or management circuitry.\n* \"dumb\" batteries, which lack any internal electronic circuitry.\n\nThe output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state. An intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage, temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging.\n\nFor [[nickel-cadmium battery|Ni-Cd]] and [[NiMH]] batteries, the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process, until the battery is fully charged. After that, the voltage ''decreases'', which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged. Such chargers are often labeled as a \u0394V, \"delta-V,\" or sometimes \"delta peak\", charger, indicating that they monitor the voltage change.\n\nThe problem is, the magnitude of \"delta-V\" can become very small or even non-existent if (very) high{{Quantify|date=October 2010}} capacity rechargeable batteries are recharged.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged, and to continue charging. Overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases. However, many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems, which are intended to prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases.\n\nA typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour, then switches to trickle charging, which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/BATTS/BATTS.HTM |title=The Great Battery Shootout |author=Dave Etchells}}</ref>\n\n===Motion-powered charger===\n[[Image: Linear induction flashlight.jpg|thumb|300px|Linear induction flashlight, charged by shaking along its long axis, causing magnet ''(visible at right)'' to slide through a coil of wire ''(center)'' to generate electricity]]\nSeveral companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on human motions.  One example, made by [[Tremont Electric]], consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down, such as when walking.  Such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success.<ref>Martin LaMonica, CNET. \"[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20076064-54/motion-powered-gadget-charger-back-on-track/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Motion-powered gadget charger back on track].\" Jul 1, 2011.

The DC pulses have a strictly controlled [[rise time]], pulse width, pulse repetition rate ([[frequency]]) and [[amplitude]]. This technology is said to work with any size, voltage, capacity or chemistry of batteries, including automotive and [[VRLA|valve-regulated]] batteries.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/913/ |title=AN913: Switch-Mode, Linear, and Pulse Charging Techniques for Li+ Battery in Mobile Phones and PDAs |publisher=Maxim |year=2001}}\n</ref>\n\nWith pulse charging, high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery.  In a [[Lead\u2013acid battery]], this breaks down lead-sulfate crystals, thus greatly extending the battery service life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html  |title=Lead\u2013acid battery sulfation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402140958/http://www.dallas.net/~jvpoll/Battery/aaPictures.html |archivedate = 2007-04-02}}</ref>\n\nSeveral kinds of pulse charging are patented.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2003088447 |title=\"fast pulse battery charger\" patent |year=2003}}\n</ref><ref>\n\"Battery charger with current pulse regulation\"\npatented 1981\nUnited States Patent 4355275\n</ref><ref>\n\"Pulse-charge battery charger\"\npatented 1997\nUnited States Patent 5633574\n</ref>  Others are [[open source hardware]].\n\nSome chargers use pulses to check the current battery state when the charger is first connected, then use constant current charging during fast charging, then use pulse charging as a kind of trickle charging to maintain the charge.<ref>[http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm \"Pulse Maintenance charging.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309020550/http://928uk.com/battery-conditioners.htm |date=March 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSome chargers use \"negative pulse charging\", also called \"reflex charging\" or \"burp charging\".\nSuch chargers use both positive and brief negative current pulses.  There is no significant evidence, however, that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging.\n\n===Solar charger===\n{{main|Solar charger}}\n{{Further|Energy harvesting}}\n[[File:Solar-Charger Varta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Varta]] Solar Charger Model 57082 with two 2100{{nbsp}}mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries]]\nSolar chargers convert light energy into low voltage [[DC current]]. They are generally [[wikt:portable|portable]], but can also be fixed mount.  Fixed mount solar chargers are also known as [[solar panels]]. Solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid via control and interface circuits, whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid (i.e. [[Automobile|cars]], [[boats]], or [[RVs]]).\n\nAlthough portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications.  Portable solar chargers are often used for [[trickle charging]], although some solar chargers (depending on the [[wattage]]), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.\n\n===Timer-based charger===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe output of a [[timer]] charger is terminated after a pre-determined time. Timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity [[Ni-Cd]] cells in the late 1990s for example (low-capacity consumer Ni-Cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger).\n\nOften a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries. If batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged, and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged. With the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year, an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries.\n\nTimer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged, even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger, would result in over-charging.\n\n===Trickle charger===\n{{Main|Trickle charging}}\n\nA trickle charger is typically a low-current (usually between 5\u20131,500&nbsp;mA) battery charger or one which has a trickle charging operating mode. A trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2\u201330&nbsp;Ah). These types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30&nbsp;Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers).  Depending on the technology of the trickle charger, it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers.  Some battery types are not suitable for trickle charging. For instance, most Li-ion batteries cannot be safely trickle charged, and the damage caused can be enough to cause a fire or even an explosion.\n\n===Universal battery charger\u2013analyzer===\nThe most sophisticated types are used in critical applications (e.g. military or aviation batteries).  These heavy-duty automatic \u201cintelligent charging\u201d systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker.  The best are universal (i.e. can charge all battery types), and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too.\n\n===USB-based charger===\n{{Off topic||Off topic|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File: Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket.jpg|thumb|Australian and New Zealand power socket with USB charger socket]]\n{{See also|USB#Power|ISO 4165}}\nSince the [[Universal Serial Bus]] specification provides for a five-volt power supply (with limited maximum power), it is possible to use a [[USB cable]] to connect a device to a power supply. Products based on this approach include chargers for [[cellular phone]]s, portable [[digital audio players]], and [[tablet computer]]s. They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of [[USB decoration]]s.\n\n====Power bank====\n\n[[Image:USB power bank.jpg|thumb|right|A power bank with USB cable.]]\n\nA power bank is a portable device that can supply power from its built-in battery through a USB port.  Power banks are popular for charging USB charged devices. They can also be used as a power supply for various USB powered devices such as lights and small fans. They usually recharge with a [[USB|USB power supply]].  The power bank includes a control circuit that both regulates charging of the battery and converts the battery voltage to 5.0 volts for the USB port. Some chargers for cells like 18650s and 26650 can also serve as a power bank.  Although it is generally more cumbersome to carry such a charger with cells rather than a conventional power bank, this arrangement can also charge cells for other uses, and swap cells that are dead.  It also has the advantage that, when the cells are dead, they can be swapped for fresh cells for immediate use rather than having to be recharged first.\n[[Image:Quintezz powerbank, opened.png|thumb|right|Many powerbanks use the common 18650 size [[lithium-ion battery]] which may be user-replaceable.]]\n\nSpecifications:\n* Capacity in Wh: Total power capacity measured by multiplying mAh by voltage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.powerbanktalk.com/best-power-banks/ |title=The Best USB Battery Packs}}</ref>\n* Capacity in mAh: [[mAh]] stands for milli Ampere-hour and measures the amount of power flow that can be supplied by a certain power bank at a specific voltage. Many manufacturers rate their products at 3.7 V, the voltage of cell(s) inside. Since USB outputs at 5 V, calculations at this voltage will yield a lower mAh number. For example, a battery pack advertised with a 3000 mAh capacity (at 3.7 V) will produce 2220 mAh at 5 V.  Power losses due to efficiency of the charging circuitry also occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/portable-power-bank-capacities-gary-explains-699550/ |title=Does a 3000 mAh portable power bank charge a 3000 mAh phone? |publisher=Android Authority |date=June 13, 2016}}</ref>\n* Simultaneous charging and discharging (also known as ''\u201cpassthrough\u201d charging''<ref name=RAV_passthrough2>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2018/06/pass-through-creative-ways-power-banks-charge/ RavPower.com blog article: \u201cHow Pass Through Charging Lets You Use Power Banks In Creative Ways\u201d]</ref><ref name=RAV_passthrough>[http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/10/danger-and-damage-of-pass-through-technology-for-batteries/ RAVpower Blog article: \u201cWhat is Passthrough Charging?\u201d]</ref>): need to specify if the powerbank's ports can output power while it being charged itself.\n* Number of output [[USB]] ports: This specifies the number of devices that can be charged simultaneously.\n* Output current rating: This specifies the current rating that it can charge maximum. The higher the number, the better the powerbank. This can vary from output port to output port. Also, some powerbanks don't have dedicated high current ports, but will drop the output at all ports if the maximum total current output of the powerbank is exceeded.\n* Input Current Rating: Input current rating is the amount of current the powerbank is able to draw at its maximum level while getting charged.\n* Safety Protections: Over Voltage Protection, Over Charge Protection, Over Current Protection, Over Heat Protection, Short-Circuit Protections and Over Discharge Protections are the common safety measures observed with standard powerbanks.\n* [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] Indications: The Led glows as per indicating the amount of charging ability left with the powerbank. Some powerbanks have a line of LEDs, with the number of LEDs lit indicating state of charge. Other powerbanks may simply have one LED which changes color or flashes when the charge of the internal battery is low.\n* [[Quick charge]] (commonly [[Qualcomm Quick Charge]]) support?\n\nSome power banks have a built-in wireless charging pad. Power banks are available in different capacity ratings.\n\n====Compatibility====\n[[File:Mini, micro and J10 USB connectors.jpg|thumb|Mini, micro and J10 USB charging connectors]]\n[[File:Lightning connector.svg|thumb|Lightning connector]]\n[[File:USB charger with three different charging ports.png|thumb|Australian 240 V USB charger with three different types of charging ports]]\nAlthough a standard exists for USB chargers<ref>{{cite web |title=IEC - Newslog > 2011-02-01: One size-fits-all mobile phone charger: IEC publishes first globally relevant standard |url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2011/nr0311.htm |website=www.iec.ch |accessdate=11 May 2019}}</ref>, there are two areas of common incompatibility.\n* The connector on the device to be charged. There are several current and many obsolete connectors, including:\n**The [[Micro USB]] connector\n**The [[Mini USB]] connector\n**The [[USB-C]] connector\n**The [[lightning connector]]\n**The [[J10 connector]]\n**Various sizes of [[coaxial power connector]], particularly the smaller sizes\n**The [[3.5 mm jack]] and [[2.5 mm jack]]\n:and others. It is essential that the connectors on the device and charger match exactly, so that the correct polarity is used.  Reversing the polarity between a battery and its charger is likely to cause battery failure and even charger failure.  The failures may result in fire or damaged / destroyed equipment..\n* The charging port. This may be smart or dumb, and each in various current ratings. Compatibility varies and must be checked to maximize safety . A mismatched charger will charge more slowly, and sometimes not at all.\n\n==Applications==\nSince a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery, it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the DC voltage output;  it is cheaper to make them that way. Battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering are sometimes termed [[battery eliminator]]s.\n\n===Battery charger for vehicles===\nThere are two main types of chargers used for vehicles:\n* To recharge a fuel vehicle's [[Car battery|starter battery]], where a modular charger is used; typically an [[IUoU battery charging|3-stage charger]].\n* To recharge an electric vehicle (EV) battery pack; see [[Charging station]].\n\nChargers for car batteries come in varying ratings. Chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.\n\n=== Electric vehicle batteries===\n\nElectric vehicle battery chargers (ECS) come in a variety of brands and characteristics. These chargers vary from 1&nbsp;kW to 7.5&nbsp;kW maximum charge rate. Some use algorithm charge curves, others use constant voltage, constant current. Some are programmable by the end user through a [[Controller area network|CAN]] port, some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage, some are preset to specified battery pack voltage, amp-hour and chemistry. Prices range from $400 to $4500.\n\nA 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity.\n\nPublic EV [[charging station]]s provide 6&nbsp;kW (host power of 208 to 240 VAC off a 40 amp circuit). 6&nbsp;kW will recharge an EV roughly 6 times faster than 1&nbsp;kW overnight charging.\n\nRapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available AC power, battery type, and the type of charging system.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/09/fuji-heavy-spee.html Fuji Heavy Speeds Up Recharging of R1e EV].

These typically employ some form of inductive connection between the grid and a charging vehicle. Some isolated chargers may be used in parallel. This allows for an increased charge current and reduced charging times. The battery has a maximum current rating that cannot be exceeded\n* Non-isolated: the battery charger has a direct electrical connection to the A/C outlet's wiring. Non-isolated chargers cannot be used in parallel.\n\n[[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC) chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver, shortening charging time.\n\n====Charge stations====\n{{Main|Charging station}}\n\n[[Better Place (company)|Project Better Place]] was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through [[leasing|leases]] and credits until filing for bankruptcy in May 2013.\n[[File:Charge6 3wACin.jpg|thumb|Auxiliary charger designed to fit a variety of proprietary devices]]\n\n====Induction-powered charging====\nResearchers at the [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST) have developed an electric transport system (called [[Online Electric Vehicle]], OLEV)  where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via [[inductive charging]], (where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself.<ref>[http://www.gizmag.com/kaist-olev-electric-vehicle/12557/ Korean electric vehicle solution].

Older ones are notoriously diverse, having a wide variety of [[DC connector]]-styles and voltages, most of which are not compatible with other manufacturers' phones or even different models of phones from a single manufacturer.\n\nUsers of publicly accessible charging kiosks must be able to cross-reference connectors with device brands/models and individual charge parameters and thus ensure delivery of the correct charge for their mobile device. A database-driven system is one solution, and is being incorporated into some designs of charging kiosks.\n\nThere are also human-powered chargers sold on the market, which typically consists of a [[dynamo]] powered by a hand [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and extension cords.

It can charge mobile phone 4 times faster than standard micro USB.\n\n===Stationary battery plants===\nTelecommunications, electric power, and computer [[uninterruptible power supply]] facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in [[battery room]]s) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.\n\n===Use in experiments===\nA battery charger can work as a DC [[power adapter]] for experimentation. It may, however, require an external [[capacitor]] to be connected across its output terminals in order to \"smooth\" the voltage sufficiently, which may be thought of as a DC voltage plus a \"[[Ripple (electrical)|ripple]]\" voltage added to it.  There may be an [[internal resistance]] connected to limit the short circuit current, and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments.\n\n==Prolonging battery life==\nWhich electrical practices, and so which charger, are best suited for use depending entirely on the type of battery. NiCd cells must be fully discharged occasionally, or else the battery loses capacity over time due to a phenomenon known as \"[[memory effect]].\" Once a month (perhaps once every 30 charges) is sometimes recommended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full [[charge cycle]]s which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries, eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity.\n\nMost modern cell phones, laptops, and most electric vehicles use [[Lithium-ion]] batteries.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2bFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA675&dq=Most+modern+cell+phones,+laptops,+and+most+electric+vehicles+use+Lithium-ion+batteries&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj16d2qiI7VAhUW92MKHVbkA7kQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Most%20modern%20cell%20phones,%20laptops,%20and%20most%20electric%20vehicles%20use%20Lithium-ion%20batteries&f=false|title=Energy: Sources, Utilization, Legislation, Sustainability, Illinois as Model State|last=Mansoori|first=G.

Barnie|date=2015-11-05|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814704021|language=en}}</ref>  These batteries last longest if the battery is frequently charged; fully discharging the cells will degrade their capacity relatively quickly, but most such batteries are used in equipment which can sense the approach of full discharge and discontinue equipment use.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} When stored after charging, lithium battery cells degrade more while fully charged than if they are only 40-50% charged. As with all battery types, degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures. Degradation in [[lithium-ion]] batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance often due to cell [[oxidation]]. This decreases the efficiency of the battery, resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the battery. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, if Li-ION cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged, which is why many such batteries in consumer goods now have an \"electronic fuse\" that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level. The electronic fuse circuitry draws a small amount of current from the battery, which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it, and with a very low initial [[state of charge]], the battery may be permanently destroyed.\n\nMotor vehicles, such as boats, RVs, ATVs, motorcycles, cars, trucks, etc. have used [[lead\u2013acid]] batteries. These batteries employ a [[sulfuric acid]] [[electrolyte]] and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect, though [[sulfation]] (a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead) will occur over time. Typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries, and the old ones recycled. [[Lead\u2013acid]] batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to \"float charge\" the battery.  This prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge, preventing sulfate from forming.  Proper temperature compensated [[float voltage]] should be used to achieve the best results.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|Alternator]] \u2013 battery charging device in car\n* [[Electric bus#Charging]]\n* [[Battery eliminator]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n* [[Charge controller]]\n* [[FuelRod]] \u2013 a kiosk-based charging service \n* [[Lithium-ion battery]]\n* [[Recharging alkaline batteries]]\n* [[Solar energy]]\n* [[Solar lamp]]\n* [[State of charge]] (batteries)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Commons category|Battery chargers|Battery charger}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battery Charger}}\n[[Category:Battery chargers| ]]\n[[Category:Battery charging]]\n[[Category:Rechargeable batteries]]\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n", "name_user": "Mheal.in", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger"}

The five-season, 154-episode series aired in prime time from September 28, 1961, to April 11, 1966, and was produced by [[Screen Gems]]. The first four seasons of ''Hazel'' aired on [[NBC]], and the fifth and final season aired on [[CBS]]. Season 1 was broadcast in [[black-and-white]] except for one episode which was in color, and seasons 2\u20135 were all broadcast in color. The show was based on [[Hazel (comics)|the single-panel comic strip of the same name]] by cartoonist [[Ted Key]], which appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Seasons 1\u20134===\nHazel is a competent, take-charge, live-in maid in the home of the Baxter family. George Baxter ([[Don DeFore]]) is a partner in the law firm of Butterworth, Hatch, Noll and Baxter; Hazel calls him \"Mr. B\". George's wife, Dorothy ([[Whitney Blake]]), is an [[interior decorator]], whom Hazel nicknames \"Missy\". Their son Harold ([[Bobby Buntrock]]) is dubbed \"Sport\" by Hazel. The family dog is Smiley. Hazel had worked previously with Dorothy's family, and has a close relationship with her. Hazel's mother died when she was 14 (she said in one episode) so she had to take care of her own family. \n\nThe series humorously dramatizes Hazel's life with the Baxters and her friendships with others in the neighborhood such as postman Barney Hatfield ([[Robert Williams (actor born 1904)|Robert Williams]]), taxi-driver Mitch Brady ([[Dub Taylor]]) and Rosie Hammaker ([[Maudie Prickett]]), another maid in the neighborhood. Many episodes focus on the perennial contest of wills between Hazel and George over issues around the house; \"Mr. B\" usually concedes defeat and grants Hazel's wishes when she tortures him by serving meager portions of her mouth-watering meals and desserts.\n\nSome episodes take Hazel outside the Baxter house and follow her life in the community. In the first episode, for example, she spearheads a drive for the construction of a neighborhood playground. Hazel's life is sometimes complicated by George's snobby Bostonian sister Deirdre Thompson ([[Cathy Lewis]]) and his gruff client Harvey Griffin ([[Howard Smith (actor)|Howard Smith]]). Dotty neighbors Herbert and Harriet Johnson ([[Donald Foster (actor)|Donald Foster]] and [[Norma Varden]]) often call upon Hazel's expertise in household matters, of which they seem ignorant.\n\n===Network change and final season===\nFor the show's final season, in an effort to appeal to a younger audience, DeFore and Blake were dropped. The departure of their characters was explained in that they were in Baghdad, Iraq, for George's work. Harold (who did not depart with his parents so he wouldn't miss any school) and Hazel moved in with George's younger brother, Steve ([[Ray Fulmer]]), a real estate agent, Steve's wife Barbara ([[Lynn Borden]]) and their daughter Susie ([[Julia Benjamin]]). Hazel provides the same housekeeping services for her revamped family. (CBS said that Blake was not available after NBC's cancellation, although DeFore stated that he was never informed of the change and found out about it while reading the newspaper). [[Ann Jillian]], who was then a teenager, was also added to the cast as Millie Ballard, Steve Baxter's receptionist; she later went on to star in her own series, ''[[It's a Living (1980 TV series)|It's a Living]]'' and numerous television movies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Production notes==\n[[File:Fam07.JPG|thumb|left|Don DeFore, Bobby Buntrock, Whitney Blake from the first season episode, \"Hazel's Secret Wish\"]]\nThe series was filmed at Columbia [[Sunset Gower Studios]], Hollywood, California. Exteriors were shot at the [[Columbia Ranch]] in Burbank. This [[movie ranch]] facade used as the Baxters' house had previously been seen in several [[Three Stooges]] films, and was used as the home for the Lawrences on the sitcom ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]''. From the driveway, the house next door to the right, is recognizable as that of Darrin and Samantha Stephens from ''[[Bewitched]].'' The episode \"What'll We Watch Tonight,\" in which Hazel purchases a color TV, is the only first season episode shot in color and appears to promote [[color television]] sets. NBC, which aired the series, was owned by [[RCA]], the largest seller of color television sets, during the period when most viewers still had black-and-white TVs.\n\nIn July 1963, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) announced that unless the show added a Negro person to the off-camera technical staff, the organization would begin a boycott of the show's sponsor, the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Two months after the announcement, the show's producers announced that a black production executive had joined the show.<ref>{{cite news |title=Negro Hired to Head Off Ford Boycott |date=September 28, 1963 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Theme song===\nWhile the weekly show began with an instrumental theme song composed by the team of Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen, the closing credits during the first eight shows of the inaugural season played the song with lyrics sung by [[The Modernaires]]. There were different arrangements of the theme song as the series progressed, including a later version by Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller.\n\n===Sponsors===\nDuring its first four seasons, ''Hazel'' was sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]], which had earlier underwritten [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s comedy and [[variety show]], ''[[The Ford Show]].'' As a result, Ford vehicles, including the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] when it was introduced in 1964, were often prominently featured on the series, even as a part of the storyline (an example of [[product placement]]). During season four, [[Lever Brothers]] co-sponsored ''Hazel.'' In its final season, [[Procter & Gamble]] and [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] were the sponsors.\n\n==Reception==\nThe show's first season placed fourth in the 1961-1962 Nielsen's ratings. Shirley Booth received two [[Emmy Awards]] (1962 and 1963) for ''Hazel'', and garnered a nomination for her third season (1964). Booth also received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best TV Star (1964) and two posthumous nominations for the [[TV Land]] Award, Favorite Made-for-TV Maid (2004 and 2006).\n\nABC loosely copied the ''Hazel'' theme in the 1962-1963 series ''[[Our Man Higgins]]'' as an English butler to a suburban American family. [[Stanley Holloway]] played the lead role, along with [[Audrey Totter]] and [[Frank Maxwell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/man-higgins/203600 |title=Our Man Higgins |website=TV Guide.com |access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 1963-1964 season, the ratings had slipped from #15 the previous year to #22. By the time NBC canceled the series in the spring of 1965, ''Hazel'' had fallen out of the top 30 programs. CBS picked it up for the 1965-1966 season, and made a number of cast changes. Buntrock remained in the cast as Harold Baxter; DeFore and Blake were dropped and replaced with Fulmer and Borden, respectively. Child actress Julia Benjamin was added to the cast as Susie Baxter. In the spring of 1966, ''Hazel'' ended its primetime network run.\n\nIn 2014, according to ''[[Playbill]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/klea-blackhurst-will-lead-hazel-musical-reading-com-332644 |title=Klea Blackhurst Will Lead Hazel Musical Reading |last=Hetrick |first=Adam |date=8 October 2014 |magazine=[[Playbill]] |access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref> actress and cabaret performer [[Klea Blackhurst]] was cast in a New York City reading of ''Hazel'', a musical based on Ted Key's cartoon character as well as the 1961-1966 TV sitcom. [[Lucie Arnaz]] directed the AEA reading that featured Blackhurst as Hazel in a cast that included [[Paul Shaffer]] as George Baxter, [[Jessica Keenan Wynn]] as Dorothy Baxter, Colin Crest as Harold Baxter, Warren Kelley as Bonkers Johnson, Ava-Riley Miles as Benedetta Bomicino, Bonale Fambrini as Scotty Fuyu and Ethan Khusidman as Reuben Steuben, along with Lance Roberts, Romelda Benjamin, Gerard Salvador, [[Erin Sullivan (actress)|Erin Sullivan]], Sharone Sayegh and [[Kevin Spirtas]] as the Narrator/Newscaster. The musical, which had first been announced to be in development for Broadway in 2010, was written by composer Ron Abel and lyricist Chuck Steffan, with a book by Lissa Levin. The industry presentations took place October 24\u201325, 2014, at the June Havoc Theatre.\n\n==Syndication==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n''Hazel'' was seen in syndicated reruns on local stations for much of the 1970s and 1980s, and at least one terrestrial station, [[WLMB]], still carries the syndicated run as of 2020.<ref>[https://www.wlmb.com/wlmb-programs-a-to-z/ WLMB Programs: A to Z].

[[Ann Jillian]], who was then a teenager, was also added to the cast as Millie Ballard, Steve Baxter's receptionist; she later went on to star in her own series, ''[[It's a Living (1980 TV series)|It's a Living]]'' and numerous television movies.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Production notes==\n[[File:Fam07.JPG|thumb|left|Don DeFore, Bobby Buntrock, Whitney Blake from the first season episode, \"Hazel's Secret Wish\"]]\nThe series was filmed at Columbia [[Sunset Gower Studios]], Hollywood, California. Exteriors were shot at the [[Columbia Ranch]] in Burbank. This [[movie ranch]] facade used as the Baxters' house had previously been seen in several [[Three Stooges]] films, and was used as the home for the Lawrences on the sitcom ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]''. From the driveway, the house next door to the right, is recognizable as that of Darrin and Samantha Stephens from ''[[Bewitched]].'' The episode \"What'll We Watch Tonight,\" in which Hazel purchases a color TV, is the only first season episode shot in color and appears to promote [[color television]] sets. NBC, which aired the series, was owned by [[RCA]], the largest seller of color television sets, during the period when most viewers still had black-and-white TVs.\n\nIn July 1963, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) announced that unless the show added a Negro person to the off-camera technical staff, the organization would begin a boycott of the show's sponsor, the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Two months after the announcement, the show's producers announced that a black production executive had joined the show.<ref>{{cite news |title=Negro Hired to Head Off Ford Boycott |date=September 28, 1963 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Theme song===\nWhile the weekly show began with an instrumental theme song composed by the team of Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen, the closing credits during the first eight shows of the inaugural season played the song with lyrics sung by [[The Modernaires]]. There were different arrangements of the theme song as the series progressed, including a later version by Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller.\n\n===Sponsors===\nDuring its first four seasons, ''Hazel'' was sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]], which had earlier underwritten [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s comedy and [[variety show]], ''[[The Ford Show]].'' As a result, Ford vehicles, including the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] when it was introduced in 1964, were often prominently featured on the series, even as a part of the storyline (an example of [[product placement]]). During season four, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]] co-sponsored ''Hazel.'' In its final season, [[Procter & Gamble]] and [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] were the sponsors.\n\n==Reception==\nThe show's first season placed fourth in the 1961-1962 Nielsen's ratings. Shirley Booth received two [[Emmy Awards]] (1962 and 1963) for ''Hazel'', and garnered a nomination for her third season (1964). Booth also received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best TV Star (1964) and two posthumous nominations for the [[TV Land]] Award, Favorite Made-for-TV Maid (2004 and 2006).\n\nABC loosely copied the ''Hazel'' theme in the 1962-1963 series ''[[Our Man Higgins]]'' as an English butler to a suburban American family. [[Stanley Holloway]] played the lead role, along with [[Audrey Totter]] and [[Frank Maxwell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/man-higgins/203600 |title=Our Man Higgins |website=TV Guide.com |access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 1963-1964 season, the ratings had slipped from #15 the previous year to #22. By the time NBC canceled the series in the spring of 1965, ''Hazel'' had fallen out of the top 30 programs. CBS picked it up for the 1965-1966 season, and made a number of cast changes. Buntrock remained in the cast as Harold Baxter; DeFore and Blake were dropped and replaced with Fulmer and Borden, respectively. Child actress Julia Benjamin was added to the cast as Susie Baxter. In the spring of 1966, ''Hazel'' ended its primetime network run.\n\nIn 2014, according to ''[[Playbill]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/klea-blackhurst-will-lead-hazel-musical-reading-com-332644 |title=Klea Blackhurst Will Lead Hazel Musical Reading |last=Hetrick |first=Adam |date=8 October 2014 |magazine=[[Playbill]] |access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref> actress and cabaret performer [[Klea Blackhurst]] was cast in a New York City reading of ''Hazel'', a musical based on Ted Key's cartoon character as well as the 1961-1966 TV sitcom. [[Lucie Arnaz]] directed the AEA reading that featured Blackhurst as Hazel in a cast that included [[Paul Shaffer]] as George Baxter, [[Jessica Keenan Wynn]] as Dorothy Baxter, Colin Crest as Harold Baxter, Warren Kelley as Bonkers Johnson, Ava-Riley Miles as Benedetta Bomicino, Bonale Fambrini as Scotty Fuyu and Ethan Khusidman as Reuben Steuben, along with Lance Roberts, Romelda Benjamin, Gerard Salvador, [[Erin Sullivan (actress)|Erin Sullivan]], Sharone Sayegh and [[Kevin Spirtas]] as the Narrator/Newscaster. The musical, which had first been announced to be in development for Broadway in 2010, was written by composer Ron Abel and lyricist Chuck Steffan, with a book by Lissa Levin. The industry presentations took place October 24\u201325, 2014, at the June Havoc Theatre.\n\n==Syndication==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\n''Hazel'' was seen in syndicated reruns on local stations for much of the 1970s and 1980s, and at least one terrestrial station, [[WLMB]], still carries the syndicated run as of 2020.<ref>[https://www.wlmb.com/wlmb-programs-a-to-z/ WLMB Programs: A to Z].

The film brought Almod\u00f3var to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the [[61st Academy Awards|1988]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1989\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 |title=The 61st Academy Awards (1989) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=20 August 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> and won five [[Goya Awards]] including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It was released on 11 November 1988. \n\nThe actual Spanish title refers to an ''{{lang|es|ataque de nervios}}'', which is not actually well translated as \"[[nervous breakdown]]\" (''{{lang|es|crisis nerviosa}}''). ''{{lang|es|Ataques de nervios}}'' are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with [[hysteria]] and more recently in the scientific literature with [[post-traumatic stress]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref>Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000).

In the film, TV actress Pepa Marcos ([[Carmen Maura]]) is depressed and taking [[sleeping pill]]s because her boyfriend Iv\u00e1n ([[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]]) has just left her. Both she and Iv\u00e1n work as [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|voice-over actors who dub]] foreign films, notably ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Sterling Hayden]]. The voice he uses to sweet-talk her (and many other women) is the same one he uses in his work. He is about to leave on a trip and has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase that he will pick up later.\n\nPepa returns home later to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela ([[Mar\u00eda Barranco]]). In anger, she rips out the phone and throws it through the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives, still overwhelmed, but before she can explain her situation, Carlos ([[Antonio Banderas]]), Iv\u00e1n's son with previous lover Luc\u00eda ([[Julieta Serrano]]), arrives with his snobbish fianc\u00e9e, Marisa ([[Rossy de Palma]]). It turns out they are apartment-hunting, and by coincidence have chosen Pepa's penthouse to look at. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv\u00e1n; Pepa wants to know where Iv\u00e1n is because she has to tell him something, but Carlos doesn't know where his father is. Candela unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself by jumping off the balcony.\n\nMeanwhile, Marisa has become bored and decides to drink some [[gazpacho]] she finds in the fridge, not realizing that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela finally gets to explain her situation: a while ago she had a love affair with an Arab who later came to visit her, bringing some friends with him. It turns out that they are a Shiite terrorist cell and Candela was unknowingly harboring them in her home. When the terrorists left, Candela fled to Pepa's place for help. Candela fears that the police think she is involved and will come for her. Pepa sets out to see a lawyer Carlos has recommended to help Candela, and ends up catching the same cab with the same Mambo-loving driver.\n\nHowever, Paulina, the lawyer she visits, is acting strangely. Pepa sees that Paulina has tickets to Stockholm. Iv\u00e1n calls the office at one point, and Paulina seems to know Pepa, and is very rude to her. Meanwhile, Candela reveals to Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to [[Stockholm]] that evening and divert it to [[Beirut]], where the Shiite terrorists have a friend who was captured by the authorities. After Carlos fixes the broken phone, he quickly calls the police, but hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, then surprisingly kisses Candela. Pepa returns and Luc\u00eda calls, announcing she is coming over to confront her about Iv\u00e1n. Carlos reveals that Luc\u00eda has been in a mental hospital since Iv\u00e1n left her and has only now been released. Pepa, now sick of Iv\u00e1n and no longer wanting to see him, heads back down with Iv\u00e1n's suitcase; she throws it out, just barely missing Iv\u00e1n, who has arrived with Paulina ([[Kiti M\u00e1nver]]) on their way to the airport. He leaves Pepa a message.\n\nPepa returns to her apartment and hears the song from the opening, \"Soy Infeliz\", which Carlos is playing. Enraged, Pepa yanks off the [[Gramophone record|record]] and throws it out of the window, and it ends up hitting Paulina. Pepa then hears Iv\u00e1n's message and once again rips out the phone and throws the answering machine back out of the window; it lands on Paulina's car. Back in the apartment, Luc\u00eda arrives, along with the phone repairman and the police, who have traced Carlos' earlier call. Candela starts to panic, but Carlos comes up with an idea: to serve everyone the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, Carlos and Candela make out on the sofa and also fall asleep, and Luc\u00eda grabs the policemen's guns and aims them at Pepa, who figures out that Paulina is the other woman Iv\u00e1n is going to Stockholm with, and that their flight is the one that the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc\u00eda reveals that she is still insane and only faked sanity when she heard Iv\u00e1n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho into Pepa's face and rushes to the airport to kill Iv\u00e1n; she sees a motorcyclist and forces him to act as her driver.\n\nPepa chases her and is joined by her neighbour Ana, who happens to be the motorcyclist's stood-up girlfriend. They quickly hail a cab (driven by the Mambo taxi driver again) and a mad chase ensues to the airport, with Luc\u00eda firing the gun at them. Luc\u00eda arrives at the airport, sees that Iv\u00e1n and Paulina are about to pass security, and aims her gun at them. Pepa arrives just in time and thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc\u00eda. Iv\u00e1n runs over to Pepa, who is now mentally and physically exhausted after two days of trying to chase down her lover. Iv\u00e1n offers to finally speak with her about whatever she has been trying to speak to him about, and for a moment, it seems he might even leave Paulina to take her back. But Pepa refuses, saying, \"There was still time last night, this morning, even today at noon. But now it's too late\".

The film brought Almod\u00f3var to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the [[61st Academy Awards|1988]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1989\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 |title=The 61st Academy Awards (1989) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=20 August 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> and won five [[Goya Awards]] including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It was released on 11 November 1988. \n\nThe actual Spanish title refers to an ''{{lang|es|ataque de nervios}}'', which is not actually well translated as \"[[nervous breakdown]]\" (''{{lang|es|crisis nerviosa}}''). ''{{lang|es|Ataques de nervios}}'' are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with [[hysteria]] and more recently in the scientific literature with [[post-traumatic stress]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref>Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000).

In the film, TV actress Pepa Marcos ([[Carmen Maura]]) is depressed and taking [[sleeping pill]]s because her boyfriend Iv\u00e1n ([[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]]) has just left her. Both she and Iv\u00e1n work as [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|voice-over actors who dub]] foreign films, notably ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Sterling Hayden]]. The voice he uses to sweet-talk her (and many other women) is the same one he uses in his work. He is about to leave on a trip and has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase that he will pick up later.\n\nPepa returns home later to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela ([[Mar\u00eda Barranco]]). In anger, she rips out the phone and throws it through the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives, still overwhelmed, but before she can explain her situation, Carlos ([[Antonio Banderas]]), Iv\u00e1n's son with previous lover Luc\u00eda ([[Julieta Serrano]]), arrives with his snobbish fianc\u00e9e, Marisa ([[Rossy de Palma]]). It turns out they are apartment-hunting, and by coincidence have chosen Pepa's penthouse to look at. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv\u00e1n; Pepa wants to know where Iv\u00e1n is because she has to tell him something, but Carlos doesn't know where his father is. Candela unsuccessfully attempts to kill herself by jumping off the balcony.\n\nMeanwhile, Marisa has become bored and decides to drink some [[gazpacho]] she finds in the fridge, not realizing that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela finally gets to explain her situation: a while ago she had a love affair with an Arab who later came to visit her, bringing some friends with him. It turns out that they are a Shiite terrorist cell and Candela was unknowingly harboring them in her home. When the terrorists left, Candela fled to Pepa's place for help. Candela fears that the police think she is involved and will come for her. Pepa sets out to see a lawyer Carlos has recommended to help Candela, and ends up catching the same cab with the same Mambo-loving driver.\n\nHowever, Paulina, the lawyer she visits, is acting strangely. Pepa sees that Paulina has tickets to Stockholm. Iv\u00e1n calls the office at one point, and Paulina seems to know Pepa, and is very rude to her. Meanwhile, Candela reveals to Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to [[Stockholm]] that evening and divert it to [[Beirut]], where the Shiite terrorists have a friend who was captured by the authorities. After Carlos fixes the broken phone, he quickly calls the police, but hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, then surprisingly kisses Candela. Pepa returns and Luc\u00eda calls, announcing she is coming over to confront her about Iv\u00e1n. Carlos reveals that Luc\u00eda has been in a mental hospital since Iv\u00e1n left her and has only now been released. Pepa, now sick of Iv\u00e1n and no longer wanting to see him, heads back down with Iv\u00e1n's suitcase; she throws it out, just barely missing Iv\u00e1n, who has arrived with Paulina ([[Kiti M\u00e1nver]]) on their way to the airport. He leaves Pepa a message.\n\nPepa returns to her apartment and hears the song from the opening, \"Soy Infeliz\", which Carlos is playing. Enraged, Pepa yanks off the [[Gramophone record|record]] and throws it out of the window, and it ends up hitting Paulina. Pepa then hears Iv\u00e1n's message and once again rips out the phone and throws the answering machine back out of the window; it lands on Paulina's car. Back in the apartment, Luc\u00eda arrives, along with the phone repairman and the police, who have traced Carlos' earlier call. Candela starts to panic, but Carlos comes up with an idea: to serve everyone the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, Carlos and Candela make out on the sofa and also fall asleep, and Luc\u00eda grabs the policemen's guns and aims them at Pepa, who figures out that Paulina is the other woman Iv\u00e1n is going to Stockholm with, and that their flight is the one that the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc\u00eda reveals that she is still insane and only faked sanity when she heard Iv\u00e1n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho into Pepa's face and rushes to the airport to kill Iv\u00e1n; she sees a motorcyclist and forces him to act as her driver.\n\nPepa chases her and is joined by her neighbour Ana, who happens to be the motorcyclist's stood-up girlfriend. They quickly hail a cab (driven by the Mambo taxi driver again) and a mad chase ensues to the airport, with Luc\u00eda firing the gun at them. Luc\u00eda arrives at the airport, sees that Iv\u00e1n and Paulina are about to pass security, and aims her gun at them. Pepa arrives just in time and thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc\u00eda. Iv\u00e1n runs over to Pepa, who is now mentally and physically exhausted after two days of trying to chase down her lover. Iv\u00e1n offers to finally speak with her about whatever she has been trying to speak to him about, and for a moment, it seems he might even leave Paulina to take her back. But Pepa refuses, saying, \"There was still time last night, this morning, even today at noon. But now it's too late\". Having saved his life, she leaves the airport, and Iv\u00e1n, for good.\n\nPepa returns to her home, which is a mess with a burnt bedroom, broken windows, a telephone ripped from the wall, spilled gazpacho on the floor, her menagerie of chickens and geese running around loose, and several unconscious visitors all overdosed on sleeping pills. Pepa sits on her balcony where Marisa has just woken up. The two women chat, sharing a moment of tranquility at the end of a hectic 48 hours, and Pepa finally reveals what her big news for Iv\u00e1n was: she's pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Pepa Marcos\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Carlos\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Luc\u00eda\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as Marisa\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Candela\n* [[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]] as Iv\u00e1n\n* [[Kiti M\u00e1nver]] as Paulina Morales\n* Guillermo Montesinos as taxi driver\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Portera [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Testiga de Jehov\u00e1]]\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as Secretaria\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 89% out of 27 professional critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.7/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/women_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown/ Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown].

For this reason, Pollard's lambda algorithm is considered an [[exponential time]] algorithm.  For an example of a [[subexponential time]] discrete logarithm algorithm, see the [[index calculus algorithm]].\n\n==Naming==\nThe algorithm is well known by two names.\n\nThe first is \"Pollard's kangaroo algorithm\".  This name is a reference to an analogy used in the paper presenting the algorithm, where the algorithm is explained in terms of using a ''tame'' [[kangaroo]] to trap a ''wild'' kangaroo.  Pollard has explained<ref>J. M. Pollard, ''Kangaroos, Monopoly and Discrete Logarithms'', Journal of Cryptology, Volume 13, pp. 437\u2013447, 2000</ref> that this analogy was inspired by a \"fascinating\" article published in the same issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'' as an exposition of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[public key cryptosystem]].  The article<ref>T. J. Dawson, ''Kangaroos'', Scientific American, August 1977, pp. 78\u201389</ref> described an experiment in which a kangaroo's \"energetic cost of locomotion, measured in terms of oxygen consumption at various speeds, was determined by placing kangaroos on a [[treadmill]]\".\n\nThe second is \"Pollard's lambda algorithm\".  Much like the name of another of Pollard's discrete logarithm algorithms, [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard's rho algorithm]], this name refers to the similarity between a visualisation of the algorithm and the [[Greek letter]] [[lambda]] (<math>\\lambda</math>).  The shorter stroke of the letter lambda corresponds to the sequence <math>\\{x_i\\}</math>, since it starts from the position b to the right of x.  Accordingly, the longer stroke corresponds to the sequence <math>\\{y_i\\}</math>, which \"collides with\" the first sequence (just like the strokes of a lambda intersect) and then follows it subsequently.\n\nPollard has expressed a preference for the name \"kangaroo algorithm\",<ref>http://sites.google.com/site/jmptidcott2/</ref> as this avoids confusion with some parallel versions of his rho algorithm, which have also been called \"lambda algorithms\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow table]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}{{Number-theoretic algorithms}}\n[[Category:Number theoretic algorithms]]\n[[Category:Computer algebra]]\n[[Category:Logarithms]]\n", "text_old": "In [[computational number theory]] and [[computer algebra|computational algebra]], '''Pollard's kangaroo algorithm''' (also '''Pollard's lambda algorithm''', see [[#Naming|Naming]] below) is an [[algorithm]] for solving the [[discrete logarithm]] problem.

Dawson, ''Kangaroos'', Scientific American, August 1977, pp. 78\u201389</ref> described an experiment in which a kangaroo's \"energetic cost of locomotion, measured in terms of oxygen consumption at various speeds, was determined by placing kangaroos on a [[treadmill]]\".\n\nThe second is \"Pollard's lambda algorithm\".  Much like the name of another of Pollard's discrete logarithm algorithms, [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms|Pollard's rho algorithm]], this name refers to the similarity between a visualisation of the algorithm and the [[Greek letter]] [[lambda]] (<math>\\lambda</math>).  The shorter stroke of the letter lambda corresponds to the sequence <math>\\{x_i\\}</math>, since it starts from the position b to the right of x.  Accordingly, the longer stroke corresponds to the sequence <math>\\{y_i\\}</math>, which \"collides with\" the first sequence (just like the strokes of a lambda intersect) and then follows it subsequently.\n\nPollard has expressed a preference for the name \"kangaroo algorithm\",<ref>http://sites.google.com/site/jmptidcott2/</ref> as this avoids confusion with some parallel versions of his rho algorithm, which have also been called \"lambda algorithms\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow table]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Number theoretic algorithms]]\n[[Category:Computer algebra]]\n[[Category:Logarithms]]\n", "name_user": "Number0316", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_kangaroo_algorithm"}

He treated&nbsp;0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including [[division by zero|division]]. By this time (the 7th&nbsp;century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as [[Khmer numerals]], and documentation shows the idea later spreading to [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]].\n\n[[File:Khmer Numerals - 605 from the Sambor inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The number 605 in [[Khmer numerals]], from an inscription from 683 AD. Early use of zero as a decimal figure.]]\n\nBrahmagupta's ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as \"zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number.\" The ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.\n\nThe use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in [[place-value system]]s. Many ancient texts used&nbsp;0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word ''nfr'' to denote zero&nbsp;balance in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry accounting]]. Indian texts used a [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|Shunye}} or {{lang|sa|shunya}} to refer to the concept of ''void''. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |title=Historia Matematica Mailing List Archive: Re: [HM&#93; The Zero Story: a question |publisher=Sunsite.utk.edu |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112073735/http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df=}}</ref> In a similar vein, [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]'', an early example of an [[formal grammar|algebraic grammar]] for the Sanskrit language (also see [[Pingala]]).\n\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta''.\n\nRecords show that the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] seemed unsure about the status of&nbsp;0 as a number: they asked themselves \"how can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting [[philosophical]] and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of&nbsp;0 and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of&nbsp;0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether&nbsp;{{num|1}} was a number.)\n\nThe late [[Olmec]] people of south-central [[Mexico]] began to use a symbol for zero, a shell [[glyph]], in the New World, possibly by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} but certainly by 40&nbsp;BC, which became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]]. Mayan arithmetic used base&nbsp;4 and base&nbsp;5 written as base&nbsp;20. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base&nbsp;4, base&nbsp;5 \"finger\" abacus.\n\nBy 130 AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for&nbsp;0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was the first ''documented'' use of a true zero in the Old World. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of his ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' (''Almagest''), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Omicron]] (otherwise meaning&nbsp;70).\n\nAnother true zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, {{lang|la|nulla}} meaning ''nothing'', not as a symbol. When division produced&nbsp;0 as a remainder, {{lang|la|nihil}}, also meaning ''nothing'', was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of [[Easter]]). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\n\n===Negative numbers {{anchor|History of negative numbers}}===\n{{further|History of negative numbers}}\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China.  ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive [[coefficient]]s, black for negative.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Staszkow |first=Ronald |author2=Robert Bradshaw |title=The Mathematical Palette (3rd ed.) |publisher=Brooks Cole |year=2004 |page=41 |isbn=0-534-40365-4}}</ref> The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd&nbsp;century AD in [[Greece]]. [[Diophantus]] referred to the equation equivalent to {{nowrap|4''x'' + 20 {{=}} 0}} (the solution is negative) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\n\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in [[India]] to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta]]'' in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today. However, in the 12th&nbsp;century in India, [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara]] gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.\"\n\n[[Europe]]an mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th&nbsp;century, although [[Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter&nbsp;13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', 1202) and later as losses (in {{lang|la|Flos}}). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David Eugene |authorlink=David_Eugene_Smith |title=History of Modern Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1958 |page=259 |isbn=0-486-20429-4}}</ref> The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] during the 15th&nbsp;century. He used them as [[exponent]]s, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\n\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] did with negative solutions in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n===Rational numbers {{anchor|History of rational numbers}}===\nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to [[prehistoric times]]. The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used their [[Egyptian fraction]] notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Kahun Papyrus]]. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of [[number theory]]. The best known of these is [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], dating to roughly 300&nbsp;BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the [[Sthananga Sutra]], which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\n\nThe concept of [[decimal fraction]]s is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to [[pi]] or the [[square root of 2]]. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base&nbsp;60) fractions with great frequency.\n\n===Irrational numbers {{anchor|History of irrational numbers}}===\n{{further|History of irrational numbers}}\nThe earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] [[Sulba Sutras]] composed between 800 and 500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-link=Helaine Selin |title=Mathematics across cultures: the history of non-Western mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2000 |page=451 |isbn=0-7923-6481-3}}</ref> The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to [[Pythagoras]], more specifically to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]], who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |chapter=Horace and the Monuments: A New Interpretation of the Archytas ''Ode'' |author=Bernard Frischer |editor=D.R.

By the 17th&nbsp; century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since [[Euclid]]. In 1872, the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil E. Kossak), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]],'' 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]] was brought about. In 1869, [[Charles M\u00e9ray]] had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of [[real number]]s, separating all [[rational number]]s into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] (''Crelle'', 101), and M\u00e9ray.\n\nThe search for roots of [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations was an important development, the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] ([[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] 1799, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] 1824) showed that they could not be solved by [[nth root|radicals]] (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of [[algebraic numbers]] (all solutions to polynomial equations). [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]] (1832) linked polynomial equations to [[group theory]] giving rise to the field of [[Galois theory]].\n\n[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of [[Euler]], and at the opening of the 19th&nbsp;century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenm\u00fcller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and G\u00fcnther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with [[determinant]]s, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]], and G\u00fcnther, in the theory of {{Lang|deu|Kettenbruchdeterminanten}}.\n\n===Transcendental numbers and reals {{anchor|History of transcendental numbers and reals}}===\n{{further|History of \u03c0}}\n\nThe existence of [[transcendental numbers]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogomolny |first=A. |authorlink=Cut-the-Knot |title=What's a number? |work=Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923231547/http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |archive-date=23 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> was first established by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] (1844, 1851). [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] proved in 1873 that ''e'' is transcendental and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor]] showed that the set of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]], so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\n\n===Infinity and infinitesimals {{anchor|History of infinity and infinitesimals}}===\n{{further|History of infinity}}\nThe earliest known conception of mathematical [[infinity]] appears in the [[Yajur Veda]], an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.\" Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the [[Jain]] mathematicians c. 400&nbsp;BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.\n\n[[Aristotle]] defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between [[actual infinity]] and [[potential infinity]]\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' discussed the idea of [[bijection|one-to-one correspondences]] between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by [[Georg Cantor]]; in 1895 he published a book about his new [[set theory]], introducing, among other things, [[transfinite number]]s and formulating the [[continuum hypothesis]].\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of [[hyperreal numbers]] represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about [[infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by [[projective geometry]], which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing.\n\n===Complex numbers {{anchor|History of complex numbers}}===\n{{further|History of complex numbers}}\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the {{nowrap|1st century AD}}, when he considered the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]]. They became more prominent when in the 16th&nbsp;century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]]. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\n\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] coined the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See [[imaginary number]] for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\n:<math>\\left ( \\sqrt{-1}\\right )^2 =\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math>\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\n:<math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab},</math>\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a}}</math>\nin the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math> to guard against this mistake.\n\nThe 18th century saw the work of [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. [[De Moivre's formula]] (1730) states:\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta </math>\nwhile [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]] (1748) gave us:\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta }. </math>\n\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until [[Caspar Wessel]] described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in [[John Wallis|Wallis]]'s ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nAlso in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] studied [[Gaussian integer|complex numbers of the form]] {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integral, or rational (and ''i'' is one of the two roots of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}}). His student, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], studied the type {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b\u03c9''}}, where ''\u03c9'' is a complex root of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0.}} Other such classes (called [[cyclotomic fields]]) of complex numbers derive from the [[roots of unity]] {{nowrap|''x''<sup>''k''</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}} for higher values of ''k''. This generalization is largely due to [[Ernst Kummer]], who also invented [[ideal number]]s, which were expressed as geometrical entities by [[Felix Klein]] in 1893.\n\nIn 1850 [[Victor Alexandre Puiseux]] took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of [[mathematical singularity|essential singular points]]. This eventually led to the concept of the [[extended complex plane]].\n\n===Prime numbers {{anchor|History of prime numbers}}===\n[[Prime number]]s have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the ''Elements'' to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and presented the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\n\nIn 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] used the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the [[Renaissance]] and later eras.\n\nIn 1796, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] conjectured the [[prime number theorem]], describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859. The [[prime number theorem]] was finally proved by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\n\n=={{anchor|Classification|Classification of numbers}}Main classification==\n{{Redirect|Number system|systems for expressing numbers|Numeral system}}\n{{See also|List of types of numbers}}Numbers can be classified into [[set (mathematics)|sets]], called '''number systems''', such as the [[natural numbers]] and the [[real numbers]].<ref>\"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens \u2013 welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden \u2013 zu einem Ganzen.\" [http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610133240/http://brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |date=2011-06-10 }} <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref> The major categories of numbers are as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 200px; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ Main number systems\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{N}</math>\n![[Natural number|Natural]]\n| 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...<br />\n<math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> are sometimes used.\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n![[Integer]]\n|..., \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>\n![[Rational number|Rational]]\n|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' is not 0\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>\n![[Real number|Real]]\n|The limit of a convergent sequence of rational numbers\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{C}</math>\n![[Complex number|Complex]]\n|''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers and ''i'' is a formal square root of&nbsp;\u22121\n|}\n\nThere is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by [[abuse of notation#Equality vs. isomorphism|abuse of notation]]), because each of these number systems is [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]] to a proper subset of the next one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing\n:<math>\\mathbb{N} \\subset \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\n===Natural numbers===\n{{Main|Natural number}}\n[[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1]]\nThe most familiar numbers are the [[natural number]]s (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with&nbsp;1 (0 was not even considered a number for the [[Ancient Greeks]].) However, in the 19th&nbsp;century, [[set theory|set theorists]] and other mathematicians started including&nbsp;0 ([[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]], i.e. 0&nbsp;elements, where&nbsp;0 is thus the smallest [[cardinal number]]) in the set of natural numbers.<ref>\n{{MathWorld|title=Natural Number|id=NaturalNumber}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |title=natural number |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=4 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213133201/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |archive-date=13 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including&nbsp;0 or not. The [[mathematical symbol]] for the set of all natural numbers is '''N''', also written <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>, and sometimes <math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nIn the [[base 10]] numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base&nbsp;10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a [[place value]] of&nbsp;1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\n\nIn [[set theory]], which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suppes |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Suppes |title=Axiomatic Set Theory |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1972 |page=[https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 1] |isbn=0-486-61630-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 }}</ref> natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number&nbsp;3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in [[Peano Arithmetic]], the number&nbsp;3 is represented as sss0, where s is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,&nbsp;3 is the third successor of&nbsp;0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent&nbsp;3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\n\n===Integers===\n{{Main|Integer}}\nThe [[negative number|negative]] of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces&nbsp;0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a [[minus sign]]). As an example, the negative of&nbsp;7 is written&nbsp;\u22127, and {{nowrap|7 + (\u22127) {{=}} 0}}. When the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including&nbsp;0), the result is defined as the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''' also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.]] Here the letter Z comes {{ety|de|Zahl|number}}. The set of integers forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with the operations addition and multiplication.<ref>{{Mathworld|Integer|Integer}}</ref>\n\nThe natural numbers form a [[subset]] of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as '''positive integers''', and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as '''non-negative integers'''.\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{Main|Rational number}}\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} represents ''m'' parts of a whole divided into ''n'' equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|2|4}} are equal, that is:\n: <math>{1 \\over 2} = {2 \\over 4}.</math>\n\nIn general,\n:<math>{a \\over b} = {c \\over d}</math> if and only if <math>{ a \\times d} = {c \\times b}.</math>\n\nIf the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' is greater than ''n'' (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than&nbsp;1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to&nbsp;1 and can also be positive, negative, or&nbsp;0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator&nbsp;1. For example&nbsp;\u22127 can be written&nbsp;{{sfrac|\u22127|1}}. The symbol for the rational numbers is '''Q''' (for ''[[quotient]]''), also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>.]]\n\n===Real numbers===\n{{Main|Real number}}\n\nThe symbol for the real numbers is '''R''', also written as <math>\\mathbb{R}.</math> They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the [[number line]]. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a [[minus sign]], e.g. -123.456.\n\nMost real numbers can only be ''approximated'' by [[decimal]] numerals, in which a [[decimal point]] is placed to the right of the digit with place value&nbsp;1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents {{sfrac|123456|1000}}, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its [[fractional part]] has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a [[repeating decimal]]. Thus {{sfrac|3}} can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.{{overline|3}}.\n\nIt turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. A famous irrational real number is the number [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of any circle to its [[diameter]]. When pi is written as\n:<math>\\pi = 3.14159265358979\\dots,</math>\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that [[proof that pi is irrational|{{pi}} is irrational]]. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237\\dots,</math>\nthe [[square root of 2]], that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions {{nowrap|( 1 trillion {{=}}  10<sup>12</sup> {{=}} 1,000,000,000,000 )}} of digits.\n\nNot only these prominent examples but [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting [[rounding|rounded]] or [[truncation|truncated]] real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only [[countably many]]. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a [[margin of error]]. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to {{sfrac|1234555|10000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|1234565|10000}} (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to {{sfrac|123456|1000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|123457|1000}} (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called [[significant digits]]. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001&nbsp; meters. If the sides of a [[rectangle]] are measured as 1.23&nbsp;meters and 4.56&nbsp;meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between {{nowrap|5.614591 square meters}} and {{nowrap|5.603011 square meters}}. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not ''significant''. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.\n\nJust as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, [[0.999...]], 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number&nbsp;1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000.... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost -9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example, 99.999... = 100.\n\nThe real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the [[least upper bound]] property.\n\nIt can be shown that any [[ordered field]], which is also [[completeness of the real numbers|complete]], is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an [[algebraically closed field]], because they do not include a solution (often called a [[square root of minus one]]) to the algebraic equation <math> x^2+1=0</math>.\n\n===Complex numbers===\n{{Main|Complex number}}\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the [[complex number]]s. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quadratic function|quadratic]] polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a [[square root]] of&nbsp;\u22121, denoted by ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'', a symbol assigned by [[Leonhard Euler]], and called the [[imaginary unit]]. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form\n:<math>\\,a + b i</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the [[complex plane]], a [[vector space]] of two real [[dimension]]s. In the expression {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, the real number ''a'' is called the [[real part]] and ''b'' is called the [[imaginary part]]. If the real part of a complex number is&nbsp;0, then the number is called an [[imaginary number]] or is referred to as ''purely imaginary''; if the imaginary part is&nbsp;0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a [[Gaussian integer]]. The symbol for the complex numbers is '''C''' or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nThe [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the complex numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], meaning that every [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has a [[zero of a function|root]] in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which is [[complete space|complete]], but unlike the real numbers, it is not [[total order|ordered]]. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that '' I'' is greater than&nbsp;1, nor is there any meaning in saying that '' I'' is less than&nbsp;1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a [[total order]] that is [[ordered field|compatible with field operations]].\n\n==Subclasses of the integers==\n\n===Even and odd numbers===\n{{main|Even and odd numbers}}\nAn '''even number''' is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is [[Euclidean division|divisible by two without remainder]]; an '''odd number''' is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"[[divisibility|divisible]]\".) Any odd number ''n'' may be constructed by the formula {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2''k'' + 1,}} for a suitable integer ''k''. Starting with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 0,}} the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number ''m'' has the form {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2''k''}} where ''k'' is again an [[integer]]. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.\n\n===Prime numbers===\n{{main|Prime number}}\nA '''prime number''' is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belongs to [[number theory]].  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called [[Goldbach's conjecture]].\n\nThe question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. A proof appears in [[Euclid's Elements]].\n\n===Other classes of integers===\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[perfect number]]s. For more examples, see [[Integer sequence]].\n\n==Subclasses of the complex numbers==\n\n===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===\n[[Algebraic number]]s are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called [[irrational number]]s. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a [[monic polynomial]] equation with integer coefficients are called [[algebraic integer]]s.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\nMotivated by the classical problems of [[Straightedge and compass construction|constructions with straightedge and compass]], the [[constructible number]]s are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.\n\n===Computable numbers===\n{{Main|Computable number}}\nA '''computable number''', also known as ''recursive number'', is a [[real number]] such that there exists an [[algorithm]] which, given a positive number ''n'' as input, produces the first ''n'' digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using [[\u03bc-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machine]]s or [[\u03bb-calculus]]. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a [[polynomial]], and thus form a [[real closed field]] that contains the real [[algebraic number]]s.\n\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\n\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, [[almost all]] real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\n\n==Extensions of the concept==\n\n===''p''-adic numbers===\n{{main|p-adic number|l1=''p''-adic number}}\nThe ''p''-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what [[radix|base]] is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a [[prime number]] base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the ''p''-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\n\nThe elements of an [[algebraic function field]] over a [[finite field]] and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see [[Function field analogy]]). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The ''p''-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\n\n===Hypercomplex numbers===\n{{main|hypercomplex number}}\nSome number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called [[hypercomplex number]]s. They include the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', introduced by Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], in which multiplication is not [[commutative]], the [[octonion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[associative]] in addition to not being commutative, and the [[sedenion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[Alternative algebra|alternative]], neither associative nor commutative.\n\n===Transfinite numbers===\n{{main|transfinite number}}\nFor dealing with infinite [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the natural numbers have been generalized to the [[ordinal number]]s and to the [[cardinal number]]s. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\n\n===Nonstandard numbers===\n[[Hyperreal number]]s are used in [[non-standard analysis]]. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *'''R'''), denote an [[ordered field]] that is a proper [[Field extension|extension]] of the ordered field of [[real number]]s '''R''' and satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. This principle allows true [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about '''R''' to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *'''R'''.\n\n[[Superreal number|Superreal]] and [[surreal number]]s extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Concrete number]]\n* [[List of numbers]]\n* [[List of numbers in various languages]]\n* [[List of types of numbers]]\n* [[Mathematical constant]]s\n* [[Mythical number]]s\n* [[Numerical cognition]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude]]\n* [[Physical constant]]s\n* [[Pi]]\n* [[Positional notation]]\n* [[Prime number]]\n* [[Subitizing and counting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Tobias Dantzig]], ''Number, the language of science; a critical survey written for the cultured non-mathematician'', New York, The Macmillan company, 1930.\n* Erich Friedman, ''[http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html What's special about this number?]''\n* Steven Galovich, ''Introduction to Mathematical Structures'', Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 23 January 1989, {{isbn|0-15-543468-3}}.\n* [[Paul Halmos]], ''Naive Set Theory'', Springer, 1974, {{isbn|0-387-90092-6}}.\n* [[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Oxford University Press, 1972.\n* [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to *56, Cambridge University Press, 1910.\n* George I.

He treated&nbsp;0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including [[division by zero|division]]. By this time (the 7th&nbsp;century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as [[Khmer numerals]], and documentation shows the idea later spreading to [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]].\n\n[[File:Khmer Numerals - 605 from the Sambor inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The number 605 in [[Khmer numerals]], from an inscription from 683 AD. Early use of zero as a decimal figure.]]\n\nBrahmagupta's ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as \"zero plus a positive number is a positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number.\" The ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta'' is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.\n\nThe use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in [[place-value system]]s. Many ancient texts used&nbsp;0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word ''nfr'' to denote zero&nbsp;balance in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry accounting]]. Indian texts used a [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|Shunye}} or {{lang|sa|shunya}} to refer to the concept of ''void''. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |title=Historia Matematica Mailing List Archive: Re: [HM&#93; The Zero Story: a question |publisher=Sunsite.utk.edu |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112073735/http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df=}}</ref> In a similar vein, [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]'', an early example of an [[formal grammar|algebraic grammar]] for the Sanskrit language (also see [[Pingala]]).\n\nThere are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the ''Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta''.\n\nRecords show that the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] seemed unsure about the status of&nbsp;0 as a number: they asked themselves \"how can 'nothing' be something?\" leading to interesting [[philosophical]] and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of&nbsp;0 and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of&nbsp;0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether&nbsp;{{num|1}} was a number.)\n\nThe late [[Olmec]] people of south-central [[Mexico]] began to use a symbol for zero, a shell [[glyph]], in the New World, possibly by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} but certainly by 40&nbsp;BC, which became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]]. Mayan arithmetic used base&nbsp;4 and base&nbsp;5 written as base&nbsp;20. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base&nbsp;4, base&nbsp;5 \"finger\" abacus.\n\nBy 130 AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for&nbsp;0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was the first ''documented'' use of a true zero in the Old World. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of his ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' (''Almagest''), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Omicron]] (otherwise meaning&nbsp;70).\n\nAnother true zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, {{lang|la|nulla}} meaning ''nothing'', not as a symbol. When division produced&nbsp;0 as a remainder, {{lang|la|nihil}}, also meaning ''nothing'', was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of [[Easter]]). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.\n\n===Negative numbers {{anchor|History of negative numbers}}===\n{{further|History of negative numbers}}\nThe abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100\u201350 BC in China.  ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive [[coefficient]]s, black for negative.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Staszkow |first=Ronald |author2=Robert Bradshaw |title=The Mathematical Palette (3rd ed.) |publisher=Brooks Cole |year=2004 |page=41 |isbn=0-534-40365-4}}</ref> The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd&nbsp;century AD in [[Greece]]. [[Diophantus]] referred to the equation equivalent to {{nowrap|4''x'' + 20 {{=}} 0}} (the solution is negative) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation gave an absurd result.\n\nDuring the 600s, negative numbers were in use in [[India]] to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta]]'' in 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today. However, in the 12th&nbsp;century in India, [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara]] gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value \"is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots.\"\n\n[[Europe]]an mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th&nbsp;century, although [[Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter&nbsp;13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', 1202) and later as losses (in {{lang|la|Flos}}). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David Eugene |authorlink=David_Eugene_Smith |title=History of Modern Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1958 |page=259 |isbn=0-486-20429-4}}</ref> The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] during the 15th&nbsp;century. He used them as [[exponent]]s, but referred to them as \"absurd numbers\".\n\nAs recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] did with negative solutions in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n===Rational numbers {{anchor|History of rational numbers}}===\nIt is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to [[prehistoric times]]. The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used their [[Egyptian fraction]] notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Kahun Papyrus]]. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of [[number theory]]. The best known of these is [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], dating to roughly 300&nbsp;BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the [[Sthananga Sutra]], which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.\n\nThe concept of [[decimal fraction]]s is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to [[pi]] or the [[square root of 2]]. Similarly, Babylonian math texts used sexagesimal (base&nbsp;60) fractions with great frequency.\n\n===Irrational numbers {{anchor|History of irrational numbers}}===\n{{further|History of irrational numbers}}\nThe earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] [[Sulba Sutras]] composed between 800 and 500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-link=Helaine Selin |title=Mathematics across cultures: the history of non-Western mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2000 |page=451 |isbn=0-7923-6481-3}}</ref> The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to [[Pythagoras]], more specifically to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]], who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However, Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.<ref>{{cite book |title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |chapter=Horace and the Monuments: A New Interpretation of the Archytas ''Ode'' |author=Bernard Frischer |editor=D.R.

By the 17th&nbsp; century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook the scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since [[Euclid]]. In 1872, the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil E. Kossak), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]],'' 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]] was brought about. In 1869, [[Charles M\u00e9ray]] had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of [[real number]]s, separating all [[rational number]]s into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] (''Crelle'', 101), and M\u00e9ray.\n\nThe search for roots of [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations was an important development, the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]] ([[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] 1799, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] 1824) showed that they could not be solved by [[nth root|radicals]] (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of [[algebraic numbers]] (all solutions to polynomial equations). [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]] (1832) linked polynomial equations to [[group theory]] giving rise to the field of [[Galois theory]].\n\n[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of [[Euler]], and at the opening of the 19th&nbsp;century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenm\u00fcller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and G\u00fcnther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with [[determinant]]s, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]], and G\u00fcnther, in the theory of {{Lang|deu|Kettenbruchdeterminanten}}.\n\n===Transcendental numbers and reals {{anchor|History of transcendental numbers and reals}}===\n{{further|History of \u03c0}}\n\nThe existence of [[transcendental numbers]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogomolny |first=A. |authorlink=Cut-the-Knot |title=What's a number? |work=Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923231547/http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |archive-date=23 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> was first established by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] (1844, 1851). [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] proved in 1873 that ''e'' is transcendental and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proved in 1882 that \u03c0 is transcendental. Finally, [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor]] showed that the set of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]], so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.\n\n===Infinity and infinitesimals {{anchor|History of infinity and infinitesimals}}===\n{{further|History of infinity}}\nThe earliest known conception of mathematical [[infinity]] appears in the [[Yajur Veda]], an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, \"If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity.\" Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the [[Jain]] mathematicians c. 400&nbsp;BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.\n\n[[Aristotle]] defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between [[actual infinity]] and [[potential infinity]]\u2014the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' discussed the idea of [[bijection|one-to-one correspondences]] between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by [[Georg Cantor]]; in 1895 he published a book about his new [[set theory]], introducing, among other things, [[transfinite number]]s and formulating the [[continuum hypothesis]].\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of [[hyperreal numbers]] represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about [[infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\nA modern geometrical version of infinity is given by [[projective geometry]], which introduces \"ideal points at infinity\", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing.\n\n===Complex numbers {{anchor|History of complex numbers}}===\n{{further|History of complex numbers}}\nThe earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the {{nowrap|1st century AD}}, when he considered the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]]. They became more prominent when in the 16th&nbsp;century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]]. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.\n\nThis was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] coined the term \"imaginary\" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See [[imaginary number]] for a discussion of the \"reality\" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation\n:<math>\\left ( \\sqrt{-1}\\right )^2 =\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math>\nseemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity\n:<math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab},</math>\nwhich is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a}}</math>\nin the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math> to guard against this mistake.\n\nThe 18th century saw the work of [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. [[De Moivre's formula]] (1730) states:\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta </math>\nwhile [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]] (1748) gave us:\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta }. </math>\n\nThe existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until [[Caspar Wessel]] described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in [[John Wallis|Wallis]]'s ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nAlso in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] studied [[Gaussian integer|complex numbers of the form]] {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integral, or rational (and ''i'' is one of the two roots of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}}). His student, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], studied the type {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b\u03c9''}}, where ''\u03c9'' is a complex root of {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0.}} Other such classes (called [[cyclotomic fields]]) of complex numbers derive from the [[roots of unity]] {{nowrap|''x''<sup>''k''</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}} for higher values of ''k''. This generalization is largely due to [[Ernst Kummer]], who also invented [[ideal number]]s, which were expressed as geometrical entities by [[Felix Klein]] in 1893.\n\nIn 1850 [[Victor Alexandre Puiseux]] took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of [[mathematical singularity|essential singular points]]. This eventually led to the concept of the [[extended complex plane]].\n\n===Prime numbers {{anchor|History of prime numbers}}===\n[[Prime number]]s have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the ''Elements'' to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and presented the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.\n\nIn 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] used the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the [[Renaissance]] and later eras.\n\nIn 1796, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] conjectured the [[prime number theorem]], describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859. The [[prime number theorem]] was finally proved by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.\n\n=={{anchor|Classification|Classification of numbers}}Main classification==\n{{Redirect|Number system|systems for expressing numbers|Numeral system}}\n{{See also|List of types of numbers}}Numbers can be classified into [[set (mathematics)|sets]], called '''number systems''', such as the [[natural numbers]] and the [[real numbers]].<ref>\"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens \u2013 welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden \u2013 zu einem Ganzen.\" [http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610133240/http://brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm |date=2011-06-10 }} <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</ref> The major categories of numbers are as follows:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 200px; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|+ Main number systems\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{N}</math>\n![[Natural number|Natural]]\n| 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...<br />\n<math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> are sometimes used.\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>\n![[Integer]]\n|..., \u22125, \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>\n![[Rational number|Rational]]\n|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' is not 0\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{R}</math>\n![[Real number|Real]]\n|The limit of a convergent sequence of rational numbers\n|-\n!<math>\\mathbb{C}</math>\n![[Complex number|Complex]]\n|''a'' + ''bi'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers and ''i'' is a formal square root of&nbsp;\u22121\n|}\n\nThere is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by [[abuse of notation#Equality vs. isomorphism|abuse of notation]]), because each of these number systems is [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]] to a proper subset of the next one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing\n:<math>\\mathbb{N} \\subset \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\n===Natural numbers===\n{{Main|Natural number}}\n[[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1]]\nThe most familiar numbers are the [[natural number]]s (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with&nbsp;1 (0 was not even considered a number for the [[Ancient Greeks]].) However, in the 19th&nbsp;century, [[set theory|set theorists]] and other mathematicians started including&nbsp;0 ([[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]], i.e. 0&nbsp;elements, where&nbsp;0 is thus the smallest [[cardinal number]]) in the set of natural numbers.<ref>\n{{MathWorld|title=Natural Number|id=NaturalNumber}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |title=natural number |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=4 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213133201/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |archive-date=13 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including&nbsp;0 or not. The [[mathematical symbol]] for the set of all natural numbers is '''N''', also written <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>, and sometimes <math>\\mathbb{N}_0</math> or <math>\\mathbb{N}_1</math> when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nIn the [[base 10]] numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10). In this base&nbsp;10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a [[place value]] of&nbsp;1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.\n\nIn [[set theory]], which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suppes |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Suppes |title=Axiomatic Set Theory |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1972 |page=[https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 1] |isbn=0-486-61630-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/axiomaticsettheo00supp_0/page/1 }}</ref> natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number&nbsp;3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in [[Peano Arithmetic]], the number&nbsp;3 is represented as sss0, where s is the \"successor\" function (i.e.,&nbsp;3 is the third successor of&nbsp;0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent&nbsp;3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.\n\n===Integers===\n{{Main|Integer}}\nThe [[negative number|negative]] of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces&nbsp;0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a [[minus sign]]). As an example, the negative of&nbsp;7 is written&nbsp;\u22127, and {{nowrap|7 + (\u22127) {{=}} 0}}. When the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including&nbsp;0), the result is defined as the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''' also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>.]] Here the letter Z comes {{ety|de|Zahl|number}}. The set of integers forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with the operations addition and multiplication.<ref>{{Mathworld|Integer|Integer}}</ref>\n\nThe natural numbers form a [[subset]] of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as '''positive integers''', and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as '''non-negative integers'''.\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{Main|Rational number}}\nA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} represents ''m'' parts of a whole divided into ''n'' equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|2|4}} are equal, that is:\n: <math>{1 \\over 2} = {2 \\over 4}.</math>\n\nIn general,\n:<math>{a \\over b} = {c \\over d}</math> if and only if <math>{ a \\times d} = {c \\times b}.</math>\n\nIf the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' is greater than ''n'' (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than&nbsp;1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to&nbsp;1 and can also be positive, negative, or&nbsp;0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator&nbsp;1. For example&nbsp;\u22127 can be written&nbsp;{{sfrac|\u22127|1}}. The symbol for the rational numbers is '''Q''' (for ''[[quotient]]''), also written [[Blackboard bold|<math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>.]]\n\n===Real numbers===\n{{Main|Real number}}\n\nThe symbol for the real numbers is '''R''', also written as <math>\\mathbb{R}.</math> They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the [[number line]]. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by a [[minus sign]], e.g. -123.456.\n\nMost real numbers can only be ''approximated'' by [[decimal]] numerals, in which a [[decimal point]] is placed to the right of the digit with place value&nbsp;1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents {{sfrac|123456|1000}}, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its [[fractional part]] has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one-tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a [[repeating decimal]]. Thus {{sfrac|3}} can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.{{overline|3}}.\n\nIt turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. A famous irrational real number is the number [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of any circle to its [[diameter]]. When pi is written as\n:<math>\\pi = 3.14159265358979\\dots,</math>\nas it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that [[proof that pi is irrational|{{pi}} is irrational]]. Another well-known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is\n:<math>\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237\\dots,</math>\nthe [[square root of 2]], that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions {{nowrap|( 1 trillion {{=}}  10<sup>12</sup> {{=}} 1,000,000,000,000 )}} of digits.\n\nNot only these prominent examples but [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting [[rounding|rounded]] or [[truncation|truncated]] real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only [[countably many]]. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always have a [[margin of error]]. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to {{sfrac|1234555|10000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|1234565|10000}} (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to {{sfrac|123456|1000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|123457|1000}} (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called [[significant digits]]. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001&nbsp; meters. If the sides of a [[rectangle]] are measured as 1.23&nbsp;meters and 4.56&nbsp;meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between {{nowrap|5.614591 square meters}} and {{nowrap|5.603011 square meters}}. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not ''significant''. Therefore, the result is usually rounded to 5.61.\n\nJust as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, [[0.999...]], 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number&nbsp;1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000.... Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost -9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example, 99.999... = 100.\n\nThe real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the [[least upper bound]] property.\n\nIt can be shown that any [[ordered field]], which is also [[completeness of the real numbers|complete]], is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an [[algebraically closed field]], because they do not include a solution (often called a [[square root of minus one]]) to the algebraic equation <math> x^2+1=0</math>.\n\n===Complex numbers===\n{{Main|Complex number}}\nMoving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the [[complex number]]s. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quadratic function|quadratic]] polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a [[square root]] of&nbsp;\u22121, denoted by ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'', a symbol assigned by [[Leonhard Euler]], and called the [[imaginary unit]]. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form\n:<math>\\,a + b i</math>\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the [[complex plane]], a [[vector space]] of two real [[dimension]]s. In the expression {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, the real number ''a'' is called the [[real part]] and ''b'' is called the [[imaginary part]]. If the real part of a complex number is&nbsp;0, then the number is called an [[imaginary number]] or is referred to as ''purely imaginary''; if the imaginary part is&nbsp;0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a [[Gaussian integer]]. The symbol for the complex numbers is '''C''' or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nThe [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the complex numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], meaning that every [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has a [[zero of a function|root]] in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which is [[complete space|complete]], but unlike the real numbers, it is not [[total order|ordered]]. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that '' I'' is greater than&nbsp;1, nor is there any meaning in saying that '' I'' is less than&nbsp;1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack a [[total order]] that is [[ordered field|compatible with field operations]].\n\n==Subclasses of the integers==\n\n===Even and odd numbers===\n{{main|Even and odd numbers}}\nAn '''even number''' is an integer that is \"evenly divisible\" by two, that is [[Euclidean division|divisible by two without remainder]]; an '''odd number''' is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term \"evenly divisible\" is now almost always shortened to \"[[divisibility|divisible]]\".) Any odd number ''n'' may be constructed by the formula {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2''k'' + 1,}} for a suitable integer ''k''. Starting with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 0,}} the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number ''m'' has the form {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2''k''}} where ''k'' is again an [[integer]]. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.\n\n===Prime numbers===\n{{main|Prime number}}\nA '''prime number''' is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belongs to [[number theory]].  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called [[Goldbach's conjecture]].\n\nThe question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. A proof appears in [[Euclid's Elements]].\n\n===Other classes of integers===\nMany subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[perfect number]]s. For more examples, see [[Integer sequence]].\n\n==Subclasses of the complex numbers==\n\n===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===\n[[Algebraic number]]s are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called [[irrational number]]s. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a [[monic polynomial]] equation with integer coefficients are called [[algebraic integer]]s.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\nMotivated by the classical problems of [[Straightedge and compass construction|constructions with straightedge and compass]], the [[constructible number]]s are those complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts can be constructed using straightedge and compass, starting from a given segment of unit length, in a finite number of steps.\n\n===Computable numbers===\n{{Main|Computable number}}\nA '''computable number''', also known as ''recursive number'', is a [[real number]] such that there exists an [[algorithm]] which, given a positive number ''n'' as input, produces the first ''n'' digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using [[\u03bc-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machine]]s or [[\u03bb-calculus]]. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a [[polynomial]], and thus form a [[real closed field]] that contains the real [[algebraic number]]s.\n\nThe computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.\n\nThe set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, [[almost all]] real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.\n\n==Extensions of the concept==\n\n===''p''-adic numbers===\n{{main|p-adic number|l1=''p''-adic number}}\nThe ''p''-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what [[radix|base]] is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a [[prime number]] base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the ''p''-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.\n\nThe elements of an [[algebraic function field]] over a [[finite field]] and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see [[Function field analogy]]). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The ''p''-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.\n\n===Hypercomplex numbers===\n{{main|hypercomplex number}}\nSome number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called [[hypercomplex number]]s. They include the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', introduced by Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], in which multiplication is not [[commutative]], the [[octonion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[associative]] in addition to not being commutative, and the [[sedenion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[Alternative algebra|alternative]], neither associative nor commutative.\n\n===Transfinite numbers===\n{{main|transfinite number}}\nFor dealing with infinite [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the natural numbers have been generalized to the [[ordinal number]]s and to the [[cardinal number]]s. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.\n\n===Nonstandard numbers===\n[[Hyperreal number]]s are used in [[non-standard analysis]]. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *'''R'''), denote an [[ordered field]] that is a proper [[Field extension|extension]] of the ordered field of [[real number]]s '''R''' and satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. This principle allows true [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about '''R''' to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *'''R'''.\n\n[[Superreal number|Superreal]] and [[surreal number]]s extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Concrete number]]\n* [[List of numbers]]\n* [[List of numbers in various languages]]\n* [[List of types of numbers]]\n* [[Mathematical constant]]s\n* [[Mythical number]]s\n* [[Numerical cognition]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude]]\n* [[Physical constant]]s\n* [[Pi]]\n* [[Positional notation]]\n* [[Prime number]]\n* [[Subitizing and counting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Tobias Dantzig]], ''Number, the language of science; a critical survey written for the cultured non-mathematician'', New York, The Macmillan company, 1930.\n* Erich Friedman, ''[http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html What's special about this number?]''\n* Steven Galovich, ''Introduction to Mathematical Structures'', Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 23 January 1989, {{isbn|0-15-543468-3}}.\n* [[Paul Halmos]], ''Naive Set Theory'', Springer, 1974, {{isbn|0-387-90092-6}}.\n* [[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Oxford University Press, 1972.\n* [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to *56, Cambridge University Press, 1910.\n* George I.
