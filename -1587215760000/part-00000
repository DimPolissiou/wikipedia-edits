The range of ''T'' is ''m'' and the null space is ''k''.]]\n\n===Idempotence===\nBy definition, a projection <math>P</math> is [[idempotent]] (i.e. <math>P^2 = P</math>).\n\n===Complementarity of range and kernel===\nLet <math>W</math> be a finite dimensional vector space and <math>P</math> be a projection on <math>W</math>. Suppose the [[Linear subspace|subspace]]s <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> are the [[range of a matrix|range]] and [[null space|kernel]] of <math>P</math> respectively.\nThen <math>P</math> has the following properties:\n\n# <math>P</math> is the identity operator <math>I</math> on <math>U</math>\n#:<math>\\forall x \\in U: Px = x</math>.\n# We have a [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] <math>W = U \\oplus V</math>. Every vector <math>x \\in W</math> may be decomposed uniquely as <math>x = u + v</math> with <math>u = Px</math> and <math>v = x - Px = (I-P)x</math>, and where <math>u \\in U, v \\in V</math>.\n\nThe range and kernel of a projection are ''complementary'', as are <math>P</math> and <math>Q = I - P</math>. The operator <math>Q</math> is also a projection as the range and kernel of <math>P</math> become the kernel and range of <math>Q</math> and vice versa. We say <math>P</math> is a projection along <math>V</math> onto <math>U</math> (kernel/range) and <math>Q</math> is a projection along <math>U</math> onto <math>V</math>.\n\n===Spectrum===\nIn infinite dimensional vector spaces, the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of a projection is contained in <math>\\{0,1\\}</math> as\n:<math> (\\lambda I - P)^{-1}= \\frac 1 \\lambda I+\\frac 1{\\lambda(\\lambda-1)} P.</math>\nOnly 0 or 1 can be an [[eigenvalue]] of a projection, implying that <math>P</math> is always a positive semi-definite matrix. The corresponding eigenspaces are (respectively) the kernel and range of the projection. Decomposition of a vector space into direct sums is not unique in general. Therefore, given a subspace <math>V</math>, there may be many projections whose range (or kernel) is <math>V</math>.\n\nIf a projection is nontrivial it has [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] <math>x^2-x = x(x-1)</math>, which factors into distinct roots, and thus <math>P</math> is [[diagonalizable]].\n\n===Product of projections===\nThe product of projections is not in general a projection, even if they are orthogonal. If two projections commute then their product is a projection, but the converse if false: the product of two non-commuting projections may be a projection. \n\nIf two orthogonal projections commute then their product is an orthogonal projection. \n\n===Orthogonal projections===\nWhen the vector space <math>W</math> has an inner product and is complete (is a [[Hilbert space]]) the concept of [[orthogonality]] can be used. An '''orthogonal projection''' is a projection for which the range <math>U</math> and the null space <math>V</math> are [[orthogonality|orthogonal subspaces]]. Thus, for every <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>W</math>, <math> \\langle Px, (y-Py) \\rangle = \\langle (x-Px) , Py \\rangle = 0</math>. Equivalently:\n:<math> \\langle x, Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, y \\rangle </math>.\n\nA projection is orthogonal if and only if it is [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]. Using the self-adjoint and idempotent properties of <math>P</math>, for any <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>W</math> we have <math>Px \\in U</math>, <math>y-Py \\in V</math>, and\n:<math> \\langle Px, y-Py \\rangle = \\langle P^2x, y-Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, P(I-P)y \\rangle = \\langle Px, (P-P^2)y \\rangle = 0 \\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle</math> is the [[inner product]] associated with <math>W</math>. Therefore, <math>Px</math> and <math>y-Py</math> are orthogonal projections.<ref>Meyer, p. 433</ref>\nThe other direction, namely that if <math>P</math> is orthogonal then it is self-adjoint, follows from\n:<math> \\langle x, Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, y \\rangle = \\langle x, P^*y \\rangle </math>\nfor every <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>W</math>; thus <math>P=P^*</math>.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"90%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Proof of existence\n|-\n|\nLet <math>H</math> be a complete metric space with an [[inner product]], and let <math>U</math> be a closed [[linear subspace]] of <math>H</math> (and hence complete as well).\n\nFor every <math>x</math> the following set of non-negative [[Normed vector space|norms]] <math>\\{\\|x-u\\| | u\\in U\\}</math>  has an [[infimum]], and due to the completeness of <math>U</math> it is a [[minimum]]. We define <math>Px</math> as the point in <math>U</math> where this minimum is obtained.\n\nObviously <math>Px</math> is in <math>U</math>. It remains to show that <math>Px</math> satisfies <math>\\langle x-Px,Px \\rangle = 0</math> and that it is linear.\n\nLet us define <math>a = x-Px</math>. For every non-zero <math>v</math> in <math>U</math>, the following holds:\n:<math>\\|a-\\frac{\\langle a,v\\rangle}{\\|v\\|^2}v\\|^2 = \\|a\\|^2 - \\frac{{\\langle a,v\\rangle}^2}{\\|v\\|^2}</math>\nBy defining <math>w = Px+\\frac{\\langle a,v\\rangle}{\\|v\\|^2}v</math> we see that <math>\\|x - w\\| < \\|x - Px\\|</math> unless <math>\\langle a,v\\rangle</math> vanishes. Since <math>Px</math> was chosen as the minimum of the abovementioned set, it follows that <math>\\langle a,v\\rangle</math> indeed vanishes. In particular, (for <math>y=Px</math>): <math>\\langle x - Px, Px\\rangle = 0</math>.\n\nLinearity follows from the vanishing of <math>\\langle x - Px, v\\rangle</math> for every <math>v \\in U</math>:\n:<math> \\langle \\left(x+y\\right)-P\\left(x+y\\right),v\\rangle = 0</math>\n:<math> \\langle \\left(x-Px\\right)+\\left(y-Py\\right),v\\rangle = 0</math>\nBy taking the difference between the equations we have \n:<math> \\langle Px+Py-P\\left(x+y\\right),v\\rangle = 0</math>\nBut since we may choose <math>v=Px+Py-P(x+y)</math> (as it is itself in <math>U</math>) it follows that <math>Px+Py=P(x+y)</math>. Similarly we have <math>\\lambda Px=P(\\lambda x)</math> for every [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] <math>\\lambda</math>.\n|}\n\n====Properties and special cases====\nAn orthogonal projection is a [[bounded operator]]. This is because for every <math>v</math> in the vector space we have, by [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]]:\n:<math>\\|Pv\\|^2 = \\langle Pv,Pv\\rangle = \\langle Pv,v\\rangle \\leq \\|Pv\\|\\cdot\\|v\\|</math>\nThus <math>\\|Pv\\|\\leq \\|v\\|</math>.\n\nFor finite dimensional complex or real vector spaces, the [[standard inner product]] can be substituted for <math>\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle</math>.\n\n=====Formulas=====\nA simple case occurs when the orthogonal projection is onto a line. If <math>u</math> is a [[unit vector]] on the line, then the projection is given by the [[outer product]]\n:<math> P_u = uu^\\mathrm{T}.</math>\n(If <math>u</math> is complex-valued, the transpose in the above equation is replaced by a Hermitian transpose). This operator leaves ''u'' invariant, and it annihilates all vectors orthogonal to <math>u</math>, proving that it is indeed the orthogonal projection onto the line containing ''u''.<ref>Meyer, p. 431</ref> A simple way to see this is to consider an arbitrary vector <math>x</math> as the sum of a component on the line (i.e. the projected vector we seek) and another perpendicular to it, <math>x=x_\\parallel+x_\\perp</math>. Applying projection, we get\n\n:<math>P_ux=u u^\\mathrm{T}x_\\parallel+uu^\\mathrm{T}x_\\perp=u \\left (\\mathrm{sign}(u^\\mathrm{T}x_\\parallel)\\|x_\\parallel\\| \\right )+u\\cdot 0=x_\\parallel</math>\n\nby the properties of the [[dot product]] of parallel and perpendicular vectors.\n\nThis formula can be generalized to orthogonal projections on a subspace of arbitrary dimension. Let <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math> be an [[orthonormal basis]] of the subspace <math>U</math>, and let <math>A</math> denote the <math>n \\times k</math> matrix whose columns are <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math>, i.e <math>A=\\begin{bmatrix} u_1 & \\ldots & u_k \\end{bmatrix}</math>. Then the projection is given by:<ref>Meyer, equation (5.13.4)</ref>\n:<math>P_A = A A^\\mathrm{T}</math>\nwhich can be rewritten as\n:<math>P_A = \\sum_i \\langle u_i,\\cdot\\rangle u_i.</math>\n\nThe matrix <math>A^{\\mathrm T}</math> is the [[partial isometry]] that vanishes on the orthogonal complement of <math>U</math> and <math>A</math> is the isometry that embeds <math>U</math> into the underlying vector space. The range of <math>P_A</math> is therefore the ''final space'' of <math>A</math>. It is also clear that <math>A A^{\\mathrm T}</math> is the identity operator on <math>U</math>.\n\nThe orthonormality condition can also be dropped. If <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math> is a (not necessarily orthonormal) basis, and <math>A</math> is the matrix with these vectors as columns, then the projection is:<ref>{{Citation | last = Banerjee | first = Sudipto | last2 = Roy | first2 = Anindya | date = 2014 | title = Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics | series = Texts in Statistical Science | publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC | edition =  1st | isbn =  978-1420095388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIOhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=projection&f=false}}</ref><ref>Meyer, equation (5.13.3)</ref>\n:<math>P_A = A (A^\\mathrm{T} A)^{-1} A^\\mathrm{T}.</math>\n\nThe matrix <math>A</math> still embeds <math>U</math> into the underlying vector space but is no longer an isometry in general. The matrix <math>(A^{\\mathrm T}A)^{-1}</math> is a \"normalizing factor\" that recovers the norm. For example, the rank-1 operator <math>u u^{\\mathrm T}</math> is not a projection if <math>\\|u\\| \\neq 1.</math> After dividing by <math>u^{\\mathrm{T}}u = \\|u\\|^2,</math> we obtain the projection <math>u(u^{\\mathrm T}u)^{-1}u^{\\mathrm T}</math> onto the subspace spanned by <math>u</math>.\n\nIn the general case, we can have an arbitrary positive definite matrix <math>D</math> defining an inner product <math>\\langle x, y \\rangle_D = y^\\dagger Dx</math>, and the projection <math>P_A</math> is given by <math>P_A x = \\mathrm{argmin}_{y \\in \\mathrm{range}(A)} \\|x - y\\|^2_D</math>.

These projections are also used to represent spatial figures in two-dimensional drawings (see [[oblique projection]]), though not as frequently as orthogonal projections. Whereas calculating the fitted value of an [[ordinary least squares]] regression requires an orthogonal projection, calculating the fitted value of an [[Instrumental_variable|instrumental variables regression]] requires an oblique projection.\n\nProjections are defined by their null space and the basis vectors used to characterize their range (which is the complement of the null space). When these basis vectors are orthogonal to the null space, then the projection is an orthogonal projection. When these basis vectors are not orthogonal to the null space, the projection is an oblique projection. Let the vectors <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math> form a basis for the range of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the <math>n \\times k</math> matrix <math>A</math>. The range and the null space are complementary spaces, so the null space has dimension <math>n-k</math>. It follows that the [[orthogonal complement]] of the null space has dimension <math>k</math>. Let <math>v_1,\\ldots,v_k</math> form a basis for the orthogonal complement of the null space of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the matrix <math>B</math>. Then the projection is defined by\n:<math> P = A (B^\\mathrm{T} A)^{-1} B^\\mathrm{T}. </math>\nThis expression generalizes the formula for orthogonal projections given above.<ref>{{Citation | last = Banerjee | first = Sudipto | last2 = Roy | first2 = Anindya | date = 2014 | title = Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics | series = Texts in Statistical Science | publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC | edition =  1st | isbn =  978-1420095388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIOhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=projection&f=false}}</ref><ref>Meyer, equation (7.10.39)</ref>\n\n===Finding projection with an inner product===\nLet <math>V</math> be a vector space (in this case a plane) spanned by orthogonal vectors <math>u_1,u_2,\\cdots ,u_p</math>. Let <math>y</math> be a vector. One can define a projection of <math>y</math> onto <math>V</math> as\n:<math> \\operatorname{proj}_Vy = \\frac{y \\cdot u^i}{u^j \\cdot u^j} u^i </math>\nwhere the <math>i</math> 's and <math>j</math> 's imply [[Einstein notation | Einstein sum notation]]. The vector <math>y</math> can be written as an orthogonal sum such that <math>y=\\operatorname{proj}_Vy + z</math>. <math>\\operatorname{proj}_Vy</math> is sometimes denoted as <math>\\hat{y}</math>. There is a theorem in Linear Algebra that states that this <math>z</math> is the shortest distance from <math>y</math> to <math>V</math> and is commonly used in areas such as machine learning.\n\n[[File:Ortho projection.svg|thumb|y is being projected onto the vector space V.]]\n\n== Canonical forms ==\n\nAny projection <math>P=P^2</math> on a vector space of dimension <math>d</math> over a field is a [[diagonalizable matrix]], since its [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] divides <math>x^2-x</math>, which splits into distinct linear factors.

Assume now <math>X</math> is a [[Banach space]].\n\nMany of the algebraic results discussed above survive the passage to this context. A given direct sum decomposition of <math>X</math> into complementary subspaces still specifies a projection, and vice versa. If <math>X</math> is the direct sum <math>X = U \\oplus V</math>, then the operator defined by <math>P(u+v) = u</math> is still a projection with range <math>U</math> and kernel <math>V</math>. It is also clear that <math>P^2 = P</math>. Conversely, if <math>P</math> is projection on <math>X</math>, i.e. <math>P^2 = P</math>, then it is easily verified that <math>(1-P)^2 = (1-P)</math>. In other words, <math>1 - P</math> is also a projection. The relation <math>P^2 = P</math> implies <math>1 = P + (1-P)</math> and <math>X</math> is the direct sum <math>\\mathrm{ran}(P) \\oplus \\mathrm{ran}(1 - P)</math>.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the finite-dimensional case, projections need not be [[bounded linear operator|continuous]] in general. If a subspace <math>U</math> of <math>X</math> is not closed in the norm topology, then projection onto <math>U</math> is not continuous. In other words, the range of a continuous projection <math>P</math> must be a closed subspace. Furthermore, the kernel of a continuous projection (in fact, a continuous linear operator in general) is closed. Thus a ''continuous'' projection <math>P</math> gives a decomposition of <math>X</math> into two complementary ''closed'' subspaces: <math>X = \\mathrm{ran}(P) \\oplus \\mathrm{ker}(P) = \\mathrm{ker}(1-P) \\oplus \\mathrm{ker}(P)</math>.\n\nThe converse holds also, with an additional assumption. Suppose <math>U</math> is a closed subspace of <math>X</math>. If there exists a closed subspace <math>V</math> such that {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''U'' \u2295 ''V''}}, then the projection <math>P</math> with range <math>U</math> and kernel <math>V</math> is continuous. This follows from the [[closed graph theorem]]. Suppose {{nowrap|''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''x''}} and {{nowrap|''Px<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''y''}}. One needs to show that <math>Px=y</math>. Since <math>U</math> is closed and {{nowrap|{''Px<sub>n</sub>''} \u2282 ''U''}}, ''y'' lies in <math>U</math>, i.e. {{nowrap|1=''Py'' = ''y''}}. Also, {{nowrap|1=''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''Px<sub>n</sub>'' = (''I'' \u2212 ''P'')''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''x'' \u2212 ''y''}}. Because <math>V</math> is closed and {{nowrap|{(''I'' \u2212 ''P'')''x<sub>n</sub>''} \u2282 ''V''}}, we have <math>x-y \\in V</math>, i.e. <math>P(x-y)=Px-Py=Px-y=0</math>, which proves the claim.\n\nThe above argument makes use of the assumption that both <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> are closed. In general, given a closed subspace <math>U</math>, there need not exist a complementary closed subspace <math>V</math>, although for [[Hilbert space]]s this can always be done by taking the [[orthogonal complement]]. For Banach spaces, a one-dimensional subspace always has a closed complementary subspace. This is an immediate consequence of [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]]. Let <math>U</math> be the linear span of <math>u</math>. By Hahn\u2013Banach, there exists a bounded linear functional <math>\\varphi</math> such that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''(''u'') = 1}}. The operator <math>P(x)=\\varphi(x)u</math> satisfies <math>P^2=P</math>, i.e. it is a projection. Boundedness of <math>\\varphi</math> implies continuity of <math>P</math> and therefore <math>\\operatorname{ker}(P) = \\operatorname{ran}(I-P)</math> is a closed complementary subspace of <math>U</math>.\n\n== Applications and further considerations ==\n\nProjections (orthogonal and otherwise) play a major role in [[algorithm]]s for certain linear algebra problems:\n* [[QR decomposition]] (see [[Householder transformation]] and [[Gram\u2013Schmidt decomposition]]);\n* [[Singular value decomposition]]\n* Reduction to [[Hessenberg matrix|Hessenberg]] form (the first step in many [[eigenvalue algorithm]]s)\n* [[Linear regression]]\n* Projective elements of matrix algebras are used in the construction of certain K-groups in [[Operator K-theory]]\n\nAs stated above, projections are a special case of idempotents. Analytically, orthogonal projections are non-commutative generalizations of [[characteristic polynomial|characteristic functions]]. Idempotents are used in classifying, for instance, [[semisimple algebra]]s, while measure theory begins with considering characteristic functions of measurable sets. Therefore, as one can imagine, projections are very often encountered in the context [[operator algebra]]s. In particular, a [[von Neumann algebra]] is generated by its complete [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of projections.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nMore generally, given a map between normed vector spaces <math>T\\colon V \\to W,</math> one can analogously ask for this map to be an isometry on the orthogonal complement of the kernel: that <math>(\\ker T)^\\perp \\to W</math> be an isometry (compare [[Partial isometry]]); in particular it must be onto. The case of an orthogonal projection is when ''W'' is a subspace of ''V.'' In [[Riemannian geometry]], this is used in the definition of a [[Riemannian submersion]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Centering matrix]], which is an example of a projection matrix.\n*[[Orthogonalization]]\n*[[Invariant subspace]]\n*[[Trace (linear algebra)#Properties|Properties of trace]]\n*[[Dykstra's projection algorithm]] to compute the projection onto an intersection of sets\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last = Banerjee | first = Sudipto | last2 = Roy | first2 = Anindya | date = 2014 | title = Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics | series = Texts in Statistical Science | publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC | edition =  1st | isbn =  978-1420095388}}\n* {{cite book|first1=N. |last1=Dunford |first2= J.

Suppose the [[Linear subspace|subspace]]s <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> are the [[range of a matrix|range]] and [[null space|kernel]] of <math>P</math> respectively.\nThen <math>P</math> has the following properties:\n\n# <math>P</math> is the identity operator <math>I</math> on <math>U</math>\n#:<math>\\forall x \\in U: Px = x</math>.\n# We have a [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] <math>W = U \\oplus V</math>. Every vector <math>x \\in W</math> may be decomposed uniquely as <math>x = u + v</math> with <math>u = Px</math> and <math>v = x - Px = (I-P)x</math>, and where <math>u \\in U, v \\in V</math>.\n\nThe range and kernel of a projection are ''complementary'', as are <math>P</math> and <math>Q = I - P</math>. The operator <math>Q</math> is also a projection as the range and kernel of <math>P</math> become the kernel and range of <math>Q</math> and vice versa. We say <math>P</math> is a projection along <math>V</math> onto <math>U</math> (kernel/range) and <math>Q</math> is a projection along <math>U</math> onto <math>V</math>.\n\n===Spectrum===\nIn infinite dimensional vector spaces, the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of a projection is contained in <math>\\{0,1\\}</math> as\n:<math> (\\lambda I - P)^{-1}= \\frac 1 \\lambda I+\\frac 1{\\lambda(\\lambda-1)} P.</math>\nOnly 0 or 1 can be an [[eigenvalue]] of a projection, implying that <math>P</math> is always a positive semi-definite matrix. The corresponding eigenspaces are (respectively) the kernel and range of the projection. Decomposition of a vector space into direct sums is not unique in general. Therefore, given a subspace <math>V</math>, there may be many projections whose range (or kernel) is <math>V</math>.\n\nIf a projection is nontrivial it has [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] <math>x^2-x = x(x-1)</math>, which factors into distinct roots, and thus <math>P</math> is [[diagonalizable]].\n\n===Product of projections===\nThe product of projections is not in general a projection, even if they are orthogonal. If two projections commute then their product is a projection, but the converse if false: the product of two non-commuting projections may be a projection (e.g. one can construct two projections $P$ and $Q$ such that $PQ = Q \\neq P = QP$). \n\nIf two orthogonal projections commute then their product is an orthogonal projection. \n\n===Orthogonal projections===\nWhen the vector space <math>W</math> has an inner product and is complete (is a [[Hilbert space]]) the concept of [[orthogonality]] can be used. An '''orthogonal projection''' is a projection for which the range <math>U</math> and the null space <math>V</math> are [[orthogonality|orthogonal subspaces]]. Thus, for every <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>W</math>, <math> \\langle Px, (y-Py) \\rangle = \\langle (x-Px) , Py \\rangle = 0</math>. Equivalently:\n:<math> \\langle x, Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, y \\rangle </math>.\n\nA projection is orthogonal if and only if it is [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]]. Using the self-adjoint and idempotent properties of <math>P</math>, for any <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>W</math> we have <math>Px \\in U</math>, <math>y-Py \\in V</math>, and\n:<math> \\langle Px, y-Py \\rangle = \\langle P^2x, y-Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, P(I-P)y \\rangle = \\langle Px, (P-P^2)y \\rangle = 0 \\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle</math> is the [[inner product]] associated with <math>W</math>. Therefore, <math>Px</math> and <math>y-Py</math> are orthogonal projections.<ref>Meyer, p. 433</ref>\nThe other direction, namely that if <math>P</math> is orthogonal then it is self-adjoint, follows from\n:<math> \\langle x, Py \\rangle = \\langle Px, y \\rangle = \\langle x, P^*y \\rangle </math>\nfor every <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in <math>W</math>; thus <math>P=P^*</math>.\n\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"90%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Proof of existence\n|-\n|\nLet <math>H</math> be a complete metric space with an [[inner product]], and let <math>U</math> be a closed [[linear subspace]] of <math>H</math> (and hence complete as well).\n\nFor every <math>x</math> the following set of non-negative [[Normed vector space|norms]] <math>\\{\\|x-u\\| | u\\in U\\}</math>  has an [[infimum]], and due to the completeness of <math>U</math> it is a [[minimum]].

It remains to show that <math>Px</math> satisfies <math>\\langle x-Px,Px \\rangle = 0</math> and that it is linear.\n\nLet us define <math>a = x-Px</math>. For every non-zero <math>v</math> in <math>U</math>, the following holds:\n:<math>\\|a-\\frac{\\langle a,v\\rangle}{\\|v\\|^2}v\\|^2 = \\|a\\|^2 - \\frac{{\\langle a,v\\rangle}^2}{\\|v\\|^2}</math>\nBy defining <math>w = Px+\\frac{\\langle a,v\\rangle}{\\|v\\|^2}v</math> we see that <math>\\|x - w\\| < \\|x - Px\\|</math> unless <math>\\langle a,v\\rangle</math> vanishes. Since <math>Px</math> was chosen as the minimum of the abovementioned set, it follows that <math>\\langle a,v\\rangle</math> indeed vanishes. In particular, (for <math>y=Px</math>): <math>\\langle x - Px, Px\\rangle = 0</math>.\n\nLinearity follows from the vanishing of <math>\\langle x - Px, v\\rangle</math> for every <math>v \\in U</math>:\n:<math> \\langle \\left(x+y\\right)-P\\left(x+y\\right),v\\rangle = 0</math>\n:<math> \\langle \\left(x-Px\\right)+\\left(y-Py\\right),v\\rangle = 0</math>\nBy taking the difference between the equations we have \n:<math> \\langle Px+Py-P\\left(x+y\\right),v\\rangle = 0</math>\nBut since we may choose <math>v=Px+Py-P(x+y)</math> (as it is itself in <math>U</math>) it follows that <math>Px+Py=P(x+y)</math>.

This is because for every <math>v</math> in the vector space we have, by [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]]:\n:<math>\\|Pv\\|^2 = \\langle Pv,Pv\\rangle = \\langle Pv,v\\rangle \\leq \\|Pv\\|\\cdot\\|v\\|</math>\nThus <math>\\|Pv\\|\\leq \\|v\\|</math>.\n\nFor finite dimensional complex or real vector spaces, the [[standard inner product]] can be substituted for <math>\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle</math>.\n\n=====Formulas=====\nA simple case occurs when the orthogonal projection is onto a line. If <math>u</math> is a [[unit vector]] on the line, then the projection is given by the [[outer product]]\n:<math> P_u = uu^\\mathrm{T}.</math>\n(If <math>u</math> is complex-valued, the transpose in the above equation is replaced by a Hermitian transpose). This operator leaves ''u'' invariant, and it annihilates all vectors orthogonal to <math>u</math>, proving that it is indeed the orthogonal projection onto the line containing ''u''.<ref>Meyer, p. 431</ref> A simple way to see this is to consider an arbitrary vector <math>x</math> as the sum of a component on the line (i.e. the projected vector we seek) and another perpendicular to it, <math>x=x_\\parallel+x_\\perp</math>. Applying projection, we get\n\n:<math>P_ux=u u^\\mathrm{T}x_\\parallel+uu^\\mathrm{T}x_\\perp=u \\left (\\mathrm{sign}(u^\\mathrm{T}x_\\parallel)\\|x_\\parallel\\| \\right )+u\\cdot 0=x_\\parallel</math>\n\nby the properties of the [[dot product]] of parallel and perpendicular vectors.\n\nThis formula can be generalized to orthogonal projections on a subspace of arbitrary dimension. Let <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math> be an [[orthonormal basis]] of the subspace <math>U</math>, and let <math>A</math> denote the <math>n \\times k</math> matrix whose columns are <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math>, i.e <math>A=\\begin{bmatrix} u_1 & \\ldots & u_k \\end{bmatrix}</math>. Then the projection is given by:<ref>Meyer, equation (5.13.4)</ref>\n:<math>P_A = A A^\\mathrm{T}</math>\nwhich can be rewritten as\n:<math>P_A = \\sum_i \\langle u_i,\\cdot\\rangle u_i.</math>\n\nThe matrix <math>A^{\\mathrm T}</math> is the [[partial isometry]] that vanishes on the orthogonal complement of <math>U</math> and <math>A</math> is the isometry that embeds <math>U</math> into the underlying vector space. The range of <math>P_A</math> is therefore the ''final space'' of <math>A</math>. It is also clear that <math>A A^{\\mathrm T}</math> is the identity operator on <math>U</math>.\n\nThe orthonormality condition can also be dropped. If <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math> is a (not necessarily orthonormal) basis, and <math>A</math> is the matrix with these vectors as columns, then the projection is:<ref>{{Citation | last = Banerjee | first = Sudipto | last2 = Roy | first2 = Anindya | date = 2014 | title = Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics | series = Texts in Statistical Science | publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC | edition =  1st | isbn =  978-1420095388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIOhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=projection&f=false}}</ref><ref>Meyer, equation (5.13.3)</ref>\n:<math>P_A = A (A^\\mathrm{T} A)^{-1} A^\\mathrm{T}.</math>\n\nThe matrix <math>A</math> still embeds <math>U</math> into the underlying vector space but is no longer an isometry in general.

Then\n:<math>P_A = A (A^\\mathrm{T} D A)^{-1} A^\\mathrm{T} D.</math>\n\nWhen the range space of the projection is generated by a [[Frame of a vector space|frame]] (i.e. the number of generators is greater than its dimension), the formula for the projection takes the form: \n<math>P_A = A A^+</math>. Here <math>A^+</math> stands for the [[Moore\u2013Penrose pseudoinverse]].

These projections are also used to represent spatial figures in two-dimensional drawings (see [[oblique projection]]), though not as frequently as orthogonal projections. Whereas calculating the fitted value of an [[ordinary least squares]] regression requires an orthogonal projection, calculating the fitted value of an [[Instrumental_variable|instrumental variables regression]] requires an oblique projection.\n\nProjections are defined by their null space and the basis vectors used to characterize their range (which is the complement of the null space). When these basis vectors are orthogonal to the null space, then the projection is an orthogonal projection. When these basis vectors are not orthogonal to the null space, the projection is an oblique projection. Let the vectors <math>u_1,\\ldots,u_k</math> form a basis for the range of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the <math>n \\times k</math> matrix <math>A</math>. The range and the null space are complementary spaces, so the null space has dimension <math>n-k</math>. It follows that the [[orthogonal complement]] of the null space has dimension <math>k</math>. Let <math>v_1,\\ldots,v_k</math> form a basis for the orthogonal complement of the null space of the projection, and assemble these vectors in the matrix <math>B</math>. Then the projection is defined by\n:<math> P = A (B^\\mathrm{T} A)^{-1} B^\\mathrm{T}. </math>\nThis expression generalizes the formula for orthogonal projections given above.<ref>{{Citation | last = Banerjee | first = Sudipto | last2 = Roy | first2 = Anindya | date = 2014 | title = Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics | series = Texts in Statistical Science | publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC | edition =  1st | isbn =  978-1420095388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIOhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=projection&f=false}}</ref><ref>Meyer, equation (7.10.39)</ref>\n\n===Finding projection with an inner product===\nLet <math>V</math> be a vector space (in this case a plane) spanned by orthogonal vectors <math>u_1,u_2,\\cdots ,u_p</math>. Let <math>y</math> be a vector. One can define a projection of <math>y</math> onto <math>V</math> as\n:<math> \\operatorname{proj}_Vy = \\frac{y \\cdot u^i}{u^j \\cdot u^j} u^i </math>\nwhere the <math>i</math> 's and <math>j</math> 's imply [[Einstein notation | Einstein sum notation]]. The vector <math>y</math> can be written as an orthogonal sum such that <math>y=\\operatorname{proj}_Vy + z</math>. <math>\\operatorname{proj}_Vy</math> is sometimes denoted as <math>\\hat{y}</math>. There is a theorem in Linear Algebra that states that this <math>z</math> is the shortest distance from <math>y</math> to <math>V</math> and is commonly used in areas such as machine learning.\n\n[[File:Ortho projection.svg|thumb|y is being projected onto the vector space V.]]\n\n== Canonical forms ==\n\nAny projection <math>P=P^2</math> on a vector space of dimension <math>d</math> over a field is a [[diagonalizable matrix]], since its [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] divides <math>x^2-x</math>, which splits into distinct linear factors.

Assume now <math>X</math> is a [[Banach space]].\n\nMany of the algebraic results discussed above survive the passage to this context. A given direct sum decomposition of <math>X</math> into complementary subspaces still specifies a projection, and vice versa. If <math>X</math> is the direct sum <math>X = U \\oplus V</math>, then the operator defined by <math>P(u+v) = u</math> is still a projection with range <math>U</math> and kernel <math>V</math>. It is also clear that <math>P^2 = P</math>. Conversely, if <math>P</math> is projection on <math>X</math>, i.e. <math>P^2 = P</math>, then it is easily verified that <math>(1-P)^2 = (1-P)</math>. In other words, <math>1 - P</math> is also a projection. The relation <math>P^2 = P</math> implies <math>1 = P + (1-P)</math> and <math>X</math> is the direct sum <math>\\mathrm{ran}(P) \\oplus \\mathrm{ran}(1 - P)</math>.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the finite-dimensional case, projections need not be [[bounded linear operator|continuous]] in general. If a subspace <math>U</math> of <math>X</math> is not closed in the norm topology, then projection onto <math>U</math> is not continuous. In other words, the range of a continuous projection <math>P</math> must be a closed subspace. Furthermore, the kernel of a continuous projection (in fact, a continuous linear operator in general) is closed. Thus a ''continuous'' projection <math>P</math> gives a decomposition of <math>X</math> into two complementary ''closed'' subspaces: <math>X = \\mathrm{ran}(P) \\oplus \\mathrm{ker}(P) = \\mathrm{ker}(1-P) \\oplus \\mathrm{ker}(P)</math>.\n\nThe converse holds also, with an additional assumption. Suppose <math>U</math> is a closed subspace of <math>X</math>. If there exists a closed subspace <math>V</math> such that {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''U'' \u2295 ''V''}}, then the projection <math>P</math> with range <math>U</math> and kernel <math>V</math> is continuous. This follows from the [[closed graph theorem]]. Suppose {{nowrap|''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''x''}} and {{nowrap|''Px<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''y''}}. One needs to show that <math>Px=y</math>. Since <math>U</math> is closed and {{nowrap|{''Px<sub>n</sub>''} \u2282 ''U''}}, ''y'' lies in <math>U</math>, i.e. {{nowrap|1=''Py'' = ''y''}}. Also, {{nowrap|1=''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''Px<sub>n</sub>'' = (''I'' \u2212 ''P'')''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2192 ''x'' \u2212 ''y''}}. Because <math>V</math> is closed and {{nowrap|{(''I'' \u2212 ''P'')''x<sub>n</sub>''} \u2282 ''V''}}, we have <math>x-y \\in V</math>, i.e. <math>P(x-y)=Px-Py=Px-y=0</math>, which proves the claim.\n\nThe above argument makes use of the assumption that both <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> are closed. In general, given a closed subspace <math>U</math>, there need not exist a complementary closed subspace <math>V</math>, although for [[Hilbert space]]s this can always be done by taking the [[orthogonal complement]]. For Banach spaces, a one-dimensional subspace always has a closed complementary subspace. This is an immediate consequence of [[Hahn\u2013Banach theorem]]. Let <math>U</math> be the linear span of <math>u</math>. By Hahn\u2013Banach, there exists a bounded linear functional <math>\\varphi</math> such that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''(''u'') = 1}}. The operator <math>P(x)=\\varphi(x)u</math> satisfies <math>P^2=P</math>, i.e. it is a projection. Boundedness of <math>\\varphi</math> implies continuity of <math>P</math> and therefore <math>\\operatorname{ker}(P) = \\operatorname{ran}(I-P)</math> is a closed complementary subspace of <math>U</math>.\n\n== Applications and further considerations ==\n\nProjections (orthogonal and otherwise) play a major role in [[algorithm]]s for certain linear algebra problems:\n* [[QR decomposition]] (see [[Householder transformation]] and [[Gram\u2013Schmidt decomposition]]);\n* [[Singular value decomposition]]\n* Reduction to [[Hessenberg matrix|Hessenberg]] form (the first step in many [[eigenvalue algorithm]]s)\n* [[Linear regression]]\n* Projective elements of matrix algebras are used in the construction of certain K-groups in [[Operator K-theory]]\n\nAs stated above, projections are a special case of idempotents. Analytically, orthogonal projections are non-commutative generalizations of [[characteristic polynomial|characteristic functions]]. Idempotents are used in classifying, for instance, [[semisimple algebra]]s, while measure theory begins with considering characteristic functions of measurable sets. Therefore, as one can imagine, projections are very often encountered in the context [[operator algebra]]s. In particular, a [[von Neumann algebra]] is generated by its complete [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of projections.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nMore generally, given a map between normed vector spaces <math>T\\colon V \\to W,</math> one can analogously ask for this map to be an isometry on the orthogonal complement of the kernel: that <math>(\\ker T)^\\perp \\to W</math> be an isometry (compare [[Partial isometry]]); in particular it must be onto. The case of an orthogonal projection is when ''W'' is a subspace of ''V.'' In [[Riemannian geometry]], this is used in the definition of a [[Riemannian submersion]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Centering matrix]], which is an example of a projection matrix.\n*[[Orthogonalization]]\n*[[Invariant subspace]]\n*[[Trace (linear algebra)#Properties|Properties of trace]]\n*[[Dykstra's projection algorithm]] to compute the projection onto an intersection of sets\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last = Banerjee | first = Sudipto | last2 = Roy | first2 = Anindya | date = 2014 | title = Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics | series = Texts in Statistical Science | publisher = Chapman and Hall/CRC | edition =  1st | isbn =  978-1420095388}}\n* {{cite book|first1=N. |last1=Dunford |first2= J.

They were not able to restock the city before Kerbogha, in turn, began besieging the city. \n\nDuring the siege, on 27 June, [[Peter the Hermit]] was sent as emissary to Kerbogha by the Crusaders to suggest that the parties settle all differences by a duel. Presumably feeling his position secure, Kerbogha did not see this course of action as being in his interest, and he declined.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the city, [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed to have discovered the [[Holy Lance]] through a vision. This discovery re-energized the Christian army. At the same time, disagreements and infighting broke out within the Atabeg's army. Kerbogha's mighty army was actually made up of levies from Baghdad, Persia, Palestine and Damascus, and the internal quarrels amongst the Emirs took precedence over any unity against the Franks. The only thing that united his allies was a common fear of Kerbogha's real goal, which was the conquest of all their lands.

By the time he arrived, around June 7, the Crusaders had already won the siege, and had held the city since 3 June. They were not able to restock the city before Kerbogha, in turn, began besieging the city. \n\nDuring the siege, on 27 June, [[Peter the Hermit]] was sent as emissary to Kerbogha by the Crusaders to suggest that the parties settle all differences by a duel. Presumably feeling his position secure, Kerbogha did not see this course of action as being in his interest, and he declined.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the city, [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed to have discovered the [[Holy Lance]] through a vision. This discovery re-energized the Christian army. At the same time, disagreements and infighting broke out within the Atabeg's army. Kerbogha's mighty army was actually made up of levies from Baghdad, Persia, Palestine and Damascus, and the internal quarrels amongst the Emirs took precedence over any unity against the Franks. The only thing that united his allies was a common fear of Kerbogha's real goal, which was the conquest of all their lands.  If [[Antioch]] fell to him, he would have been invincible.<ref>Jones, Terry., Ereira, Alan. \"''Crusades''\". [[Penguin Books]], 1996. pp.43</ref>\n\nOn 28 June, when [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], the leader of the Christian army, decided to attack, the Emirs decided to humble Kerbogha by abandoning him at the critical moment. Kerbogha was taken by surprise by the organization and discipline of the Christian army. This motivated, unified Christian army was in fact so large that Kerbogha's strategy of dividing his own forces was ineffective.<ref>''Gesta Francorum:The Defeat of Kerbogha'', excerpt online at [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gesta-cde.html Medieval Sourcebook], accessed November, 2008.</ref> He was quickly routed by the Crusaders. He was forced to retreat, and returned to [[Mosul]] a broken man.\n\n== Later Life ==\nDespite his defeats outside of the cities of both Edessa and Antioch, Kerbogha's position in Mosul went unchallenged through the rest of his life. He spent time raising [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], the namesake of the [[Zengid dynasty]], who took power in Mosul in 1127 following the rule of a series of Seljuk vassals after Kerbogha's death in 1102.\n\n==See also== \n*[[Baldwin and Arnold of Beauvais]]\n*[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]]\n*[[First Crusade]]\n*[[Siege of Antioch]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Turkic rulers]] \n[[Category:Muslims of the First Crusade]]\n[[Category:Atabegs]]\n[[Category:11th-century Turkic people]]\n[[Category:Seljuk Empire]]\n[[Category:Medieval rulers]]\n[[Category:Mosul]]\n[[Category:year of birth missing]]\n[[Category:1102 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Mugsalot", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u00b1 3 categories usingHotCat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbogha"}
