The original founder [[Hans Ziller]] is still in the band and is the only one who has the rights to the Bonfire name.\n\n==Biography==\n===Cacumen (1972\u20131986)===\nIn 1972, in the Bavarian town of [[Ingolstadt]] the teenaged guitarist Hans Ziller, put together a rock band called Cacumen with his guitarist brother Karl and gathered a bunch of friends to complete the band. The name of the group was taken from a school test Hans had done and it translates from Latin as \"the top of a mountain\". For the next six years, the band played in small local venues, but formed a fan base in their hometown. In 1978, the group consisted of Hans and Karl on guitars, Horst Maier on guitar (in 1983, Maier's last name would become Maier-Thorn), Hans Hauptmann on bass and Hans Forstner on drums. When the band started searching for a replacement singer, [[Claus Lessmann]], a fellow student of Hans', was hired.\n\nLessmann previously had performed in the bands Ginger and Sunset and was known for his harmonic vocals and he fit in perfectly with Cacumen. With this line-up, the band had a chance to start branching out to venues outside Ingolstadt. The band recorded a single in 1979 called \"[[Riding Away]]\", which featured the song \"Wintertale\" on the flip side. The group used this opportunity to begin touring in clubs, schools and even in parking lots. The fan base grew and Cacumen was finally signed to an independent label. By then though, Karl Ziller had departed the group. The self-titled ''[[Cacumen (album)|Cacumen]]'' album was released in 1981 and featured a new version of \"Riding Away\".\n\nEventually, Cacumen got in contact with Hanns Schmidt-Theissen, who owned a small music studio. Schmidt-Theissen had played with the group on the \"Riding Away\" single and was supporting the band at live venues on keyboards. Since money was poor and Schmidt-Theissen was willing to help, they recorded the album ''[[Bad Widow]]'' at his studio in [[Rodgau]], Germany in 1982. Schmidt-Theissen helped the group to get a contract, and was successful at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the fan base of the band was growing as was the number of performance dates. In 1983, Robert Prskalowicz replaced Hans Hauptmann on bass and this group became the best-known Cacumen formation, but when they signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], the group had had a total make-over. Prskalowicz and Hans Forstner were no longer with the group as of March 1985. They departed because they could not commit to the group full-time and were replaced with [[Joerg Deisinger]] on bass, previously from Rascal and Dynasty, while Dominik H\u00fclshorst from Darxon became the new drummer.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\">Deisinger, J. & Begai, C. (2008), ''[http://www.fireandfame.com Fire And Fame]'', BOD Publishing GmbH, {{ISBN|978-3-8370-4594-9}}</ref> The band updated also their image, donning the standard look of an 80s hard rock group. Finally, the company requested a name change, as they found Cacumen was too hard for the average customer to pronounce and not a very marketable name. After a brain storming session, the new name selected was Bonfire, which came into effect in May 1986.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" />\n\n===Bonfire, the first coming (1986\u20131994)===\nBonfire's worldwide debut album was released in June 1986 with the title ''[[Don't Touch the Light]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> During the recording of the follow-up album in May 1987, H\u00fclshorst was fired due to musical differences and Bonfire proceeded to release their next album ''[[Fireworks (Bonfire album)|Fireworks]]'' as a quartet,<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> with the drums played by [[Ken Mary]] from the American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Fifth Angel]].<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> Two versions of this album exist, the worldwide version and the North American version, which cover features the four members and contains the song \"You Make Me Feel\" from the first album.\n\nBetween the second and third albums, Bonfire went through many changes. Although Tommy Wagner filled the drum kit for a TV spot, the band needed a new full-time drummer, which appeared in December 1987, when Edgar Patrik from [[Sinner (band)|Sinner]], [[Samson (band)|Samson]] and Tyran Pace joined.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> In July 1988, during the ''Fireworks'' Tour, Maier had to leave due to his [[rheumatism]] becoming too much of a crippling factor to play guitar and be on stage. Taking his spot in August was Angel Schleifer, formerly of Doc Savage, Red Alert, [[Sinner (band)|Sinner]], Mad Max, [[Pretty Maids]] and Helter Skelter.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> The tour went on and once it was completed, the band settled down to collaborate for a new album. It was then that Hans Ziller had problems with the record company and the band's management due in part to his family commitments at the time. Against the band's better decisions, he was fired from the group for not having his focus on the band and in June 1989 and Bonfire carried on as a quartet.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> Bonfire's first two albums were the only ones released commercially in North America.\n\nDespite the business decision, Lessmann and Ziller maintained a great friendship. When Ziller formed his own group, Lessmann was asked to write songs as well as perform vocals. The record company's policy did not allow him to do so, leaving Ziller the task to find a replacement singer for his new band, EZ Livin'.\n\nThe decision to remove Ziller from Bonfire began to show on Lessmann, who had remained in the band. After many attempts to break through in the North American scene and what he thought was a disappointing fourth album, Lessmann left the band on September 25, 1992.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> His announcement was not a total shock to the rest of the band, but it did leave them with the dilemma of who would take his place. One vocalist that had the group's attention was [[Michael Bormann]], who was singing for Letter X and had his own side-group called Jaded Heart. Moreover, he was previously in High Voltage and the J.R. Blackmore Group.  Even though he was willing to sing with Bonfire, he was committed to his other two projects so the group continued looking. The unsuccessful attempt to find a full-time vocalist led to Bormann becoming the new frontman of Bonfire in March 1993.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> Although he did leave Letter X, he maintained his band Jaded Heart.\n\nDespite the new singer, Bonfire were in a rut now. Their record company refused to release any new material that did not have Lessmann singing and the years of [[grunge]] music had started.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> The band felt that the end was in sight and released a live album featuring concert recordings from the ''Point Blank'' Tour with Lessmann on vocals. The album Bormann had sung on was shelved (but later released as a bootleg called ''Bonfire - End of an Era Demos'') and Bonfire performed for the last time on July 29, 1994 without officially breaking up.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" />\n\n===Claus & Hans - Lessmann/Ziller to Ex (1992\u20131996)===\nWhile Bonfire was trying to carry on with their new lead vocalist, Lessmann and Ziller reunited in 1992 to form the project Lessmann/Ziller, after Hans Ziller had disbanded EZ Livin'.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> In 1993, they released the German sung [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Glaub Dran]]''. The EP was followed by a few single releases of songs that were not on the initial recording. The project had limited success, not as was initially expected. In 1995, Lessmann/Ziller evolved to become a group called Ex, which in May featured Joerg Deisinger on bass and Dominik H\u00fclshorst on drums, almost a reunion of the 1986 Bonfire line-up. EX was a good band, but Lessmann and Ziller realized that the only means of recapturing their old fan base was under the name Bonfire.\n\n===The Return of Bonfire - Charade emerges (1996\u20132000)===\nIn 1996, Lessmann and Ziller decided to start legal proceedings to get the rights to the Bonfire name as well as to the music from 1986 to 1992. On July 3, a one-time payment was made to the last Bonfire members of 1994 and Lessmann and Ziller renamed their Ex project to Bonfire. The second coming began with the reissue of ''Glaub Dran'' with other songs in English in 1996. In 1997 they hired Chris Lausmann on guitar and keyboards, who had played with Affair and Frontline; Uwe K\u00f6hler on bass, formally from Black Tears, Paradise Leaf, Big Apple, Lipstikk, [[Blitzkrieg (band)|Blitzkrieg]] and British Steel; and finally Jurgen Wiehler on drums, who had played with Backdoor Affair, Heaven Sent, Chain Reaction, Loud & Proud, EZ Livin', Parish Garden, Wet Paint and 88 Crash.\n\nAlso in 1997, Michael Bormann and Angel Schleifer got back together and wanted to release the shelved Bonfire album they had recorded in 1993. Joerg Deisinger was not interested and Edgar Patrik had other commitments, so the reunion was only for the duo composed by Bormann and Schleifer. Because of the change of ownership for the Bonfire name, Bormann and Schleifer decided to call themselves Charade. The shelved album was released in 1998 in Japan, becoming a highly sought after CD. The partnership between Bormann and Schleifer ended in May 2011, releasing 2 albums in total.\n\n===Worldwide exposure (2001\u20132014)===\nSince 1996, Bonfire has released at least one album a year and their fan base has grown, surpassing their 1980s popularity. In 2002, Lausmann left the group, but that did not stop the band. In 2004, after successfully gaining the rights to their pre-Bonfire material, the band released a five-part CD series called ''The Early Days''. Parts 1, 2 and 3 were the reissuing of the Cacumen albums, part 4 was the EZ Livin' album and part 5 was the Lessmann/Ziller album, every one of them featuring bonus material.\n\nIn 2006, Bonfire celebrated their 20th anniversary with Chris Limburg from Vice, Wet Paint and Lustfinger in the role of co-guitarist. In 2008, Bonfire released a [[rock opera]] album called ''[[The R\u00e4uber]]''.  A special DVD of the opera performance that also featured new music videos of several of the songs from the album was released soon afterwards, including a remixed version of the song \"You Make Me Feel\". The new version of the song is featured on the [[PlayStation]] game ''[[SingStar]]''.\n\n2009 saw the return of yet another original member of Bonfire. J\u00fcrgen Wiehler left the band unexpectedly and was replaced with the returning Dominik H\u00fclshorst on January 15. This was followed by the long anticipated return to the North American stage as the band performed at the [[Rocklahoma]] Festival on July 12 in [[Pryor, Oklahoma]], USA. In 2010, on March 25, Bonfire signed to a major label again, this time with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], with hopes that they would be handled and promoted much better than BMG did in the 1980s.  Unfortunately this partnership lasted only a few months. They released the single \"Deutsche National Hymne\" for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup in South Africa 2010]], remaining on the German Top 50 Single Charts for seven weeks.\n\nIn 2011, the band released [[Branded (Bonfire album)|Branded]] as a studio album, which also made the German album charts. This was followed up with a complete live performance release of their 1987 album, Fireworks, entitled [[Fireworks Still Alive]]. Dominik H\u00fclshorst's stay with Bonfire unfortunately was short, ending in March 2012. He was replaced by Gregorian drummer Harry Reischmann.\n\n===New line-up (2015\u2013present)===\nIt was announced on 11 January by a member of Bonfire's public relations team, with direct quotes from [[Hans Ziller]], that Bonfire had gone through a great change for 2015.  According to an e-mail that was sent out to fans by Willi Wrede, a falling out had occurred between long time singer [[Claus Lessmann]] and founder member Ziller that resulted in \"an ending\" to the band.  The web site known as melodicrock.com <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/articles/news-feed/2015/01/12/bonfire-announce-new-albumline-uplabelmanagement-and-2015-tour|title=BONFIRE Announce New Album/Line-Up/Label/Management and 2015 Tour|date=January 12, 2015|website=MelodicRock.com|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref> had already published the news two days prior that this had happened with addition information that former [[Accept (band)|Accept]] and [[Bangalore Choir]] vocalist [[David Reece]] would be taking on the vocal duties and recording a new album with the group.  The e-mail by Wrede went into further details of what had occurred.  Lessmann and Chris Limburg no longer had the desire to continue and Uwe K\u00f6hler had also decided to leave the group and pursue a new course in music with another band.  Ziller had wanted to carry on with Harry Reischmann (drums) and so hired Reece as well as Ronnie Parkes (Bass) from [[Seven Witches]] These musicians for the year of 2014 were performing together as EZ Livin', a solo venture by Ziller while Bonfire had taken a break. The new second guitarist of Bonfire is Frank Pan\u00e9, member of the German metal band Solemnity and ex-member of Red to Grey, and Valley's Eve.\n\nIn 2016, Bonfire celebrated their 30th anniversary and a new double album, ''Pearls'', released on UDR/Warner on the 18 March 2016. This recording featured past band hits that were re-recorded.  At the beginning of July it was announced that Reece and the band had mutually agreed to part ways.  To fill in the vacancy [[Michael Bormann]] was announced as the new frontman, but he was not be able to join the group for a few months.  Alexx Stahl of Purple Rising and Roxxcalibur agreed to be a temporary singer to fulfill the band's commitments until Bormann's arrival.  During that time the group agreed that Stahl put a lot of effort in to the performances, so it was agreed all around that he would become the full-time lead vocalist.\n\n==Band members==\n\n===Current

Problems arose and he stayed with Bonfire, but he recorded some demos, which appeared on ''Bonfire - The Early Days Part 4''.\n\nMichael Bormann, when he joined Bonfire in 1993, maintained his membership in Jaded Heart and also was involved with a recording by the J.R. Blackmore Group. During the time Charade existed from 1997 to 2011, he was still with Jaded Heart until 2004 doing five albums in that time.  He has been involved with other projects since then as well. The Sygnet until 2000 with one album; being a soloist since 2002 (four albums up to 2011); created the band known as Rain in 1997 and disbanded by 2008 (two albums); part of Biss (2002\u20132004) doing one album; 20th Century Boys (2003-2004) with one release.  This was followed with [[Zeno Roth|Zeno]] (2005\u2013present) with one album; The Trophy (2006\u2013present) one album; and [[Bloodbound]] (2007) also one album.  He has been with Redrum since 2004 with one album in 2007 and Idea (2003\u2013present).  During his VERY brief time with Bonfire on 2016, Michael was still associated with Zeno, The Trophy, Redrum, Idea, Powerworld, Grindhouse and [[Silent Force]] as well as remaining a soloist.\n\nHans Ziller, when Bonfire took a break in 2014, resurrected EZ Livin' temporarily for one release.  The group was then rebranded to become the third incarnation of Bonfire.\n\nChris Lausmann's former band, Frontline, reunited in 2000. He stayed with them until 2002 that included two albums. He also had a project with Frontline vocalist Stephen Kaemmerer called Revolution, but nothing came of that.\n\nUwe K\u00f6hler joined Affair in 1999 and the group released an album in 2002. News from the band's website states a new album is in the works with a new membership line-up but it is unknown if K\u00f6hler is still a member.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Wiehler was part of the punk-rock band known as Lustfinger from 2002 to 2012, appearing on a couple of albums. He was listed as a member of The Scovilles (2004\u20132008) and has been a member of the industrial metal band [[industrial metal]] band [[Megaherz]] since 2007.\n\nAngel Schleifer, since Charade came into existence, was part of Sabu until 1998 and a short reunion in 2003, that included two albums, but he and [[Paul Sabu]] have worked together on one of Paul's solo alums. He was also involved with Demon Drive until 2001 with one album and has contributed to the two albums done by the Voices of Rock project spanning from 2007 to 2009.\n\nHarry Reischmann, during his time with Bonfire, was involved with AXEperience, Solemnity until 2012, [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]], Skibbie, Rock The Big Band and even was part of Hans Ziller's resurrected EZ Livin\u2019, which became the third incarnation of Bonfire.\n\nDavid Reece was with the following groups while he was involved with Bonfire: Tango Down, Wicked Sensation, Reece Percudani Group and has done some solo work.\n\nRonnie Parkes has been with Tango Down and [[Seven Witches]] since joining Bonfire.\n\nFrank Pane joined Bonfire but maintained his membership in Purpendicular and AXEperience along with his own solo effort.  He has since started a band called Sainted Sinners.\n\nTim Breideband joined Bonfire while still maintaining his position in Roughhouse.\n\nAlexx Stahl, upon joining Bonfire, maintained his membership in Purple Risng and Roxxcalibur.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bonfire (band)}}\n\n* {{MusicBrainz artist|id=780fcd1f-9808-4da6-aad8-2858884dd7df}}\n* [http://planetmosh.com/claus-lessmann-of-bonfire-interviewed/ Audio interview with Claus Lessmann April 2012]\n* [http://www.bonfire.de Bonfire Official Website]\n* [http://www.charade-project.de Charade Official Website]\n* [http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonfirerocks Bonfire's Yahoo Fan Group]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090708090934/http://www.bonfire-fanclub-germany.de/ Bonfire Fanclub Germany]\n\n{{Bonfire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bonfire}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1972]]\n[[Category:German heavy metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:German hard rock musical groups]]\n[[Category:RCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Sony BMG artists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Bonfire\n| background          = group_or_band\n| image               =\n| image_size          = \n| landscape           = yes\n| caption             = \n| alias               = Cacumen, Lessmann/Ziller, Ex, EZ Livin'\n| origin              = [[Ingolstadt]], [[Germany]]\n| genre               = [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], [[glam metal]]\n| years_active        = 1972\u20131985 (as Cacumen), 1986\u2013present (as Bonfire)\n| label               = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], LZ Records, [[Universal Music Group|Universal]], H\u00c1rt, UDR/Warner\n| website             = {{URL|bonfire.de}}\n| current_members     = Alexx Stahl<br />[[Hans Ziller]]<br />Frank Pan\u00e9<br />Ronnie Parkes<br />Tim Breideband\n| past_members        = Hans Zehetbauer<br />Alfons Schlamp<br />Karl Ziller<br />Hanns Schmidt-Thei\u00dfen<br />Hans Hauptmann<br />Hans Forstner<br />Robert Prskalowicz<br />Horst Maier-Thorn<br />[[David Reece]]<br />Angel Schleifer<br />[[Joerg Deisinger]]<br />Edgar Patrik<br />Chris Lausmann<br />J\u00fcrgen \"Bam Bam\" Wiehler<br />Dominik H\u00fclshorst<br />[[Claus Lessmann]]<br />Chris \"Yps\" Limburg<br />Uwe K\u00f6hler<br />Harry Reischmann<br />[[Michael Bormann]]\n}}\n\n'''Bonfire''' (originally '''Cacumen''') is a [[Germany|German]] [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, founded in [[Ingolstadt]], [[Germany]] in 1972 by Hans Ziller.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=62}}</ref>  In 1986, based on the advice of the record company and the management, the band changed its name to Bonfire. The original founder [[Hans Ziller]] is still in the band and is the only one who has the rights to the Bonfire name.\n\n==Biography==\n===Cacumen (1972\u20131986)===\nIn 1972, in the Bavarian town of [[Ingolstadt]] the teenaged guitarist Hans Ziller, put together a rock band called Cacumen with his guitarist brother Karl and gathered a bunch of friends to complete the band. The name of the group was taken from a school test Hans had done and it translates from Latin as \"the top of a mountain\". For the next six years, the band played in small local venues, but formed a fan base in their hometown. In 1978, the group consisted of Hans and Karl on guitars, Horst Maier on guitar (in 1983, Maier's last name would become Maier-Thorn), Hans Hauptmann on bass and Hans Forstner on drums. When the band started searching for a replacement singer, [[Claus Lessmann]], a fellow student of Hans', was hired.\n\nLessmann previously had performed in the bands Ginger and Sunset and was known for his harmonic vocals and he fit in perfectly with Cacumen. With this line-up, the band had a chance to start branching out to venues outside Ingolstadt. The band recorded a single in 1979 called \"[[Riding Away]]\", which featured the song \"Wintertale\" on the flip side. The group used this opportunity to begin touring in clubs, schools and even in parking lots. The fan base grew and Cacumen was finally signed to an independent label. By then though, Karl Ziller had departed the group. The self-titled ''[[Cacumen (album)|Cacumen]]'' album was released in 1981 and featured a new version of \"Riding Away\".\n\nEventually, Cacumen got in contact with Hanns Schmidt-Theissen, who owned a small music studio. Schmidt-Theissen had played with the group on the \"Riding Away\" single and was supporting the band at live venues on keyboards. Since money was poor and Schmidt-Theissen was willing to help, they recorded the album ''[[Bad Widow]]'' at his studio in [[Rodgau]], Germany in 1982. Schmidt-Theissen helped the group to get a contract, and was successful at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, the fan base of the band was growing as was the number of performance dates. In 1983, Robert Prskalowicz replaced Hans Hauptmann on bass and this group became the best-known Cacumen formation, but when they signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], the group had had a total make-over. Prskalowicz and Hans Forstner were no longer with the group as of March 1985. They departed because they could not commit to the group full-time and were replaced with [[Joerg Deisinger]] on bass, previously from Rascal and Dynasty, while Dominik H\u00fclshorst from Darxon became the new drummer.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\">Deisinger, J. & Begai, C. (2008), ''[http://www.fireandfame.com Fire And Fame]'', BOD Publishing GmbH, {{ISBN|978-3-8370-4594-9}}</ref> The band updated also their image, donning the standard look of an 80s hard rock group. Finally, the company requested a name change, as they found Cacumen was too hard for the average customer to pronounce and not a very marketable name. After a brain storming session, the new name selected was Bonfire, which came into effect in May 1986.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" />\n\n===Bonfire, the first coming (1986\u20131994)===\nBonfire's worldwide debut album was released in June 1986 with the title ''[[Don't Touch the Light]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> During the recording of the follow-up album in May 1987, H\u00fclshorst was fired due to musical differences and Bonfire proceeded to release their next album ''[[Fireworks (Bonfire album)|Fireworks]]'' as a quartet,<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> with the drums played by [[Ken Mary]] from the American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Fifth Angel]].<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> Two versions of this album exist, the worldwide version and the North American version, which cover features the four members and contains the song \"You Make Me Feel\" from the first album.\n\nBetween the second and third albums, Bonfire went through many changes. Although Tommy Wagner filled the drum kit for a TV spot, the band needed a new full-time drummer, which appeared in December 1987, when Edgar Patrik from [[Sinner (band)|Sinner]], [[Samson (band)|Samson]] and Tyran Pace joined.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> In July 1988, during the ''Fireworks'' Tour, Maier had to leave due to his [[rheumatism]] becoming too much of a crippling factor to play guitar and be on stage. Taking his spot in August was Angel Schleifer, formerly of Doc Savage, Red Alert, [[Sinner (band)|Sinner]], Mad Max, [[Pretty Maids]] and Helter Skelter.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> The tour went on and once it was completed, the band settled down to collaborate for a new album. It was then that Hans Ziller had problems with the record company and the band's management due in part to his family commitments at the time. Against the band's better decisions, he was fired from the group for not having his focus on the band and in June 1989 and Bonfire carried on as a quartet.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> Bonfire's first two albums were the only ones released commercially in North America.\n\nDespite the business decision, Lessmann and Ziller maintained a great friendship. When Ziller formed his own group, Lessmann was asked to write songs as well as perform vocals. The record company's policy did not allow him to do so, leaving Ziller the task to find a replacement singer for his new band, EZ Livin'.\n\nThe decision to remove Ziller from Bonfire began to show on Lessmann, who had remained in the band. After many attempts to break through in the North American scene and what he thought was a disappointing fourth album, Lessmann left the band on September 25, 1992.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> His announcement was not a total shock to the rest of the band, but it did leave them with the dilemma of who would take his place. One vocalist that had the group's attention was [[Michael Bormann]], who was singing for Letter X and had his own side-group called Jaded Heart. Moreover, he was previously in High Voltage and the J.R. Blackmore Group.  Even though he was willing to sing with Bonfire, he was committed to his other two projects so the group continued looking. The unsuccessful attempt to find a full-time vocalist led to Bormann becoming the new frontman of Bonfire in March 1993.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> Although he did leave Letter X, he maintained his band Jaded Heart.\n\nDespite the new singer, Bonfire were in a rut now. Their record company refused to release any new material that did not have Lessmann singing and the years of [[grunge]] music had started.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" /> The band felt that the end was in sight and released a live album featuring concert recordings from the ''Point Blank'' Tour with Lessmann on vocals. The album Bormann had sung on was shelved (but later released as a bootleg called ''Bonfire - End of an Era Demos'') and Bonfire performed for the last time on July 29, 1994 without officially breaking up.<ref name=\"Fire And Fame\" />\n\n===Claus & Hans - Lessmann/Ziller to Ex (1992\u20131996)===\nWhile Bonfire was trying to carry on with their new lead vocalist, Lessmann and Ziller reunited in 1992 to form the project Lessmann/Ziller, after Hans Ziller had disbanded EZ Livin'.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> In 1993, they released the German sung [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Glaub Dran]]''. The EP was followed by a few single releases of songs that were not on the initial recording. The project had limited success, not as was initially expected. In 1995, Lessmann/Ziller evolved to become a group called Ex, which in May featured Joerg Deisinger on bass and Dominik H\u00fclshorst on drums, almost a reunion of the 1986 Bonfire line-up. EX was a good band, but Lessmann and Ziller realized that the only means of recapturing their old fan base was under the name Bonfire.\n\n===The Return of Bonfire - Charade emerges (1996\u20132000)===\nIn 1996, Lessmann and Ziller decided to start legal proceedings to get the rights to the Bonfire name as well as to the music from 1986 to 1992. On July 3, a one-time payment was made to the last Bonfire members of 1994 and Lessmann and Ziller renamed their Ex project to Bonfire. The second coming began with the reissue of ''Glaub Dran'' with other songs in English in 1996. In 1997 they hired Chris Lausmann on guitar and keyboards, who had played with Affair and Frontline; Uwe K\u00f6hler on bass, formally from Black Tears, Paradise Leaf, Big Apple, Lipstikk, [[Blitzkrieg (band)|Blitzkrieg]] and British Steel; and finally Jurgen Wiehler on drums, who had played with Backdoor Affair, Heaven Sent, Chain Reaction, Loud & Proud, EZ Livin', Parish Garden, Wet Paint and 88 Crash.\n\nAlso in 1997, Michael Bormann and Angel Schleifer got back together and wanted to release the shelved Bonfire album they had recorded in 1993. Joerg Deisinger was not interested and Edgar Patrik had other commitments, so the reunion was only for the duo composed by Bormann and Schleifer. Because of the change of ownership for the Bonfire name, Bormann and Schleifer decided to call themselves Charade. The shelved album was released in 1998 in Japan, becoming a highly sought after CD. The partnership between Bormann and Schleifer ended in May 2011, releasing 2 albums in total.\n\n===Worldwide exposure (2001\u20132014)===\nSince 1996, Bonfire has released at least one album a year and their fan base has grown, surpassing their 1980s popularity. In 2002, Lausmann left the group, but that did not stop the band. In 2004, after successfully gaining the rights to their pre-Bonfire material, the band released a five-part CD series called ''The Early Days''. Parts 1, 2 and 3 were the reissuing of the Cacumen albums, part 4 was the EZ Livin' album and part 5 was the Lessmann/Ziller album, every one of them featuring bonus material.\n\nIn 2006, Bonfire celebrated their 20th anniversary with Chris Limburg from Vice, Wet Paint and Lustfinger in the role of co-guitarist. In 2008, Bonfire released a [[rock opera]] album called ''[[The R\u00e4uber]]''.  A special DVD of the opera performance that also featured new music videos of several of the songs from the album was released soon afterwards, including a remixed version of the song \"You Make Me Feel\". The new version of the song is featured on the [[PlayStation]] game ''[[SingStar]]''.\n\n2009 saw the return of yet another original member of Bonfire. J\u00fcrgen Wiehler left the band unexpectedly and was replaced with the returning Dominik H\u00fclshorst on January 15. This was followed by the long anticipated return to the North American stage as the band performed at the [[Rocklahoma]] Festival on July 12 in [[Pryor, Oklahoma]], USA. In 2010, on March 25, Bonfire signed to a major label again, this time with [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]], with hopes that they would be handled and promoted much better than BMG did in the 1980s.  Unfortunately this partnership lasted only a few months. They released the single \"Deutsche National Hymne\" for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup in South Africa 2010]], remaining on the German Top 50 Single Charts for seven weeks.\n\nIn 2011, the band released [[Branded (Bonfire album)|Branded]] as a studio album, which also made the German album charts. This was followed up with a complete live performance release of their 1987 album, Fireworks, entitled [[Fireworks Still Alive]]. Dominik H\u00fclshorst's stay with Bonfire unfortunately was short, ending in March 2012. He was replaced by Gregorian drummer Harry Reischmann.\n\n===New line-up (2015\u2013present)===\nIt was announced on 11 January by a member of Bonfire's public relations team, with direct quotes from [[Hans Ziller]], that Bonfire had gone through a great change for 2015.  According to an e-mail that was sent out to fans by Willi Wrede, a falling out had occurred between long time singer [[Claus Lessmann]] and founder member Ziller that resulted in \"an ending\" to the band.  The web site known as melodicrock.com <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/articles/news-feed/2015/01/12/bonfire-announce-new-albumline-uplabelmanagement-and-2015-tour|title=BONFIRE Announce New Album/Line-Up/Label/Management and 2015 Tour|date=January 12, 2015|website=MelodicRock.com|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref> had already published the news two days prior that this had happened with addition information that former [[Accept (band)|Accept]] and [[Bangalore Choir]] vocalist [[David Reece]] would be taking on the vocal duties and recording a new album with the group.  The e-mail by Wrede went into further details of what had occurred.  Lessmann and Chris Limburg no longer had the desire to continue and Uwe K\u00f6hler had also decided to leave the group and pursue a new course in music with another band.  Ziller had wanted to carry on with Harry Reischmann (drums) and so hired Reece as well as Ronnie Parkes (Bass) from [[Seven Witches]] These musicians for the year of 2014 were performing together as EZ Livin', a solo venture by Ziller while Bonfire had taken a break. The new second guitarist of Bonfire is Frank Pan\u00e9, member of the German metal band Solemnity and ex-member of Red to Grey, and Valley's Eve.\n\nIn 2016, Bonfire celebrated their 30th anniversary and a new double album, ''Pearls'', released on UDR/Warner on the 18 March 2016. This recording featured past band hits that were re-recorded.  At the beginning of July it was announced that Reece and the band had mutually agreed to part ways.  To fill in the vacancy [[Michael Bormann]] was announced as the new frontman, but he was not be able to join the group for a few months.  Alexx Stahl of Purple Rising and Roxxcalibur agreed to be a temporary singer to fulfill the band's commitments until Bormann's arrival.  During that time the group agreed that Stahl put a lot of effort in to the performances, so it was agreed all around that he would become the full-time lead vocalist.\n\n==Band members==\n\n===Current

Problems arose and he stayed with Bonfire, but he recorded some demos, which appeared on ''Bonfire - The Early Days Part 4''.\n\nMichael Bormann, when he joined Bonfire in 1993, maintained his membership in Jaded Heart and also was involved with a recording by the J.R. Blackmore Group. During the time Charade existed from 1997 to 2011, he was still with Jaded Heart until 2004 doing five albums in that time.  He has been involved with other projects since then as well. The Sygnet until 2000 with one album; being a soloist since 2002 (four albums up to 2011); created the band known as Rain in 1997 and disbanded by 2008 (two albums); part of Biss (2002\u20132004) doing one album; 20th Century Boys (2003-2004) with one release.  This was followed with [[Zeno Roth|Zeno]] (2005\u2013present) with one album; The Trophy (2006\u2013present) one album; and [[Bloodbound]] (2007) also one album.  He has been with Redrum since 2004 with one album in 2007 and Idea (2003\u2013present).  During his VERY brief time with Bonfire on 2016, Michael was still associated with Zeno, The Trophy, Redrum, Idea, Powerworld, Grindhouse and [[Silent Force]] as well as remaining a soloist.\n\nHans Ziller, when Bonfire took a break in 2014, resurrected EZ Livin' temporarily for one release.  The group was then rebranded to become the third incarnation of Bonfire.\n\nChris Lausmann's former band, Frontline, reunited in 2000. He stayed with them until 2002 that included two albums. He also had a project with Frontline vocalist Stephen Kaemmerer called Revolution, but nothing came of that.\n\nUwe K\u00f6hler joined Affair in 1999 and the group released an album in 2002. News from the band's website states a new album is in the works with a new membership line-up but it is unknown if K\u00f6hler is still a member.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Wiehler was part of the punk-rock band known as Lustfinger from 2002 to 2012, appearing on a couple of albums. He was listed as a member of The Scovilles (2004\u20132008) and has been a member of the industrial metal band [[industrial metal]] band [[Megaherz]] since 2007.\n\nAngel Schleifer, since Charade came into existence, was part of Sabu until 1998 and a short reunion in 2003, that included two albums, but he and [[Paul Sabu]] have worked together on one of Paul's solo alums. He was also involved with Demon Drive until 2001 with one album and has contributed to the two albums done by the Voices of Rock project spanning from 2007 to 2009.\n\nHarry Reischmann, during his time with Bonfire, was involved with AXEperience, Solemnity until 2012, [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]], Skibbie, Rock The Big Band and even was part of Hans Ziller's resurrected EZ Livin\u2019, which became the third incarnation of Bonfire.\n\nDavid Reece was with the following groups while he was involved with Bonfire: Tango Down, Wicked Sensation, Reece Percudani Group and has done some solo work.\n\nRonnie Parkes has been with Tango Down and [[Seven Witches]] since joining Bonfire.\n\nFrank Pane joined Bonfire but maintained his membership in Purpendicular and AXEperience along with his own solo effort.  He has since started a band called Sainted Sinners.\n\nTim Breideband joined Bonfire while still maintaining his position in Roughhouse.\n\nAlexx Stahl, upon joining Bonfire, maintained his membership in Purple Risng and Roxxcalibur.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bonfire (band)}}\n* [http://planetmosh.com/claus-lessmann-of-bonfire-interviewed/ Audio interview with Claus Lessmann April 2012]\n* [http://www.bonfire.de Bonfire Official Website]\n* [http://www.charade-project.de Charade Official Website]\n* [http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/bonfirerocks Bonfire's Yahoo Fan Group]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090708090934/http://www.bonfire-fanclub-germany.de/ Bonfire Fanclub Germany]\n\n{{Bonfire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bonfire}}\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1972]]\n[[Category:German heavy metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:German hard rock musical groups]]\n[[Category:RCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Sony BMG artists]]\n", "name_user": "Pembes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add link to MusicBrainz", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_(band)"}

(Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of [[Voicelessness|unvoiced consonants]], [[Click consonant|clicks]], [[whistling]] and [[whispering]].)\n\nGenerally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the [[larynx]] (voice box), and the articulators. The [[lungs]], the \"pump\" must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds. The vocal folds (vocal cords) then vibrate to use airflow from the lungs to create audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lionsvoiceclinic.umn.edu/page2.htm#physiology101|title=About the voice|website=www.lionsvoiceclinic.umn.edu|access-date=2018-02-08}}</ref> The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to \u2018fine-tune\u2019 [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]].

Adult male voices are usually lower-pitched and have larger folds. The male vocal folds (which would be measured vertically in the opposite diagram), are between 17&nbsp;mm and 25&nbsp;mm in length.<ref>Thurman, Leon & Welch, ed., Graham (2000), Body mind & voice: Foundations of voice education (revised ed.), Collegeville, Minnesota: The Voice Care Network et al., {{ISBN|0-87414-123-0}}</ref> The female vocal folds are between 12.5&nbsp;mm and 17.5&nbsp;mm in length.\n\nThe folds are within the [[larynx]]. They are attached at the back (side nearest the spinal cord) to the ''arytenoids cartilages'', and at the front (side under the chin) to the [[thyroid]] cartilage. They have no outer edge as they blend into the side of the [[Vertebrate trachea|breathing tube]] (the illustration is out of date and does not show this well) while their inner edges or \"margins\" are free to vibrate (the hole). They have a three layer construction of an [[epithelium]], vocal ligament, then muscle ([[vocalis muscle]]), which can shorten and bulge the folds. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the vocal cord is the [[vestibular fold]] or ''false vocal cord'', which has a small [[wikt:sac|sac]] between its two folds.\n\nThe difference in vocal folds size between men and women means that they have differently pitched voices. Additionally, [[genetics]] also causes variances amongst the same sex, with men's and women's [[singing]] voices being categorized into types. For example, among men, there are [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]] (ranging from [[scientific pitch notation|E2 to D7 and higher]]), and among women, [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (ranging from F3 to C6 and higher). There are additional categories for [[Opera#Operatic voices|operatic voices]], see [[voice type]]. This is not the only source of difference between male and female voice. Men, generally speaking, have a larger [[vocal tract]], which essentially gives the resultant voice a lower-sounding [[timbre]]. This is mostly independent of the vocal folds themselves.\n\n==Voice modulation in spoken language==\nHuman spoken language makes use of the ability of almost all people in a given society to dynamically modulate certain parameters of the laryngeal voice source in a consistent manner. The most important communicative, or phonetic, parameters are the voice pitch (determined by the vibratory frequency of the vocal folds) and the degree of separation of the vocal folds, referred to as vocal fold adduction (coming together) or abduction (separating).<ref name=\"Rothenberg_BSD\">[http://www.rothenberg.org/Breath-Stream/BSD_contents.htm Rothenberg, M. ''The Breath-Stream Dynamics of Simple-Released Plosive Production'', Vol. 6, Bibliotheca Phonetica, Karger, Basel, 1968.]</ref>\n\nThe ability to vary the ab/adduction of the vocal folds quickly has a strong genetic component, since vocal fold adduction has a life-preserving function in keeping food from passing into the lungs, in addition to the covering action of the epiglottis. Consequently, the muscles that control this action are among the fastest in the body.<ref name=\"Rothenberg_BSD\" /> Children can learn to use this action consistently during speech at an early age, as they learn to speak the difference between utterances such as \"apa\" (having an abductory-adductory gesture for the p) as \"aba\" (having no abductory-adductory gesture).<ref name=\"Rothenberg_BSD\" /> Surprisingly enough, they can learn to do this well before the age of two by listening only to the voices of adults around them who have voices much different from their own, and even though the laryngeal movements causing these phonetic differentiations are deep in the throat and not visible to them.\n\nIf an abductory movement or adductory movement is strong enough, the vibrations of the vocal folds will stop (or not start). If the gesture is abductory and is part of a speech sound, the sound will be called [[voiceless]]. However, voiceless speech sounds are sometimes better identified as containing an abductory gesture, even if the gesture was not strong enough to stop the vocal folds from vibrating. This anomalous feature of voiceless speech sounds is better understood if it is realized that it is the change in the spectral qualities of the voice as abduction proceeds that is the primary acoustic attribute that the listener attends to when identifying a voiceless speech sound, and not simply the presence or absence of voice (periodic energy).<ref name=\"Rothenberg_IF\">[http://www.rothenberg.org/Glottal/glottal.pdf Rothenberg, M. The glottal volume velocity waveform during loose and tight voiced glottal adjustments, Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, 22-28 August 1971 ed. by A. Rigault and R. Charbonneau, published in 1972 by Mouton, The Hague \u2013 Paris.]</ref>\n\nAn adductory gesture is also identified by the change in voice spectral energy it produces. Thus, a speech sound having an adductory gesture may be referred to as a \"glottal stop\" even if the vocal fold vibrations do not entirely stop.<ref name=\"Rothenberg_IF\"/>\n\nOther aspects of the voice, such as variations in the regularity of vibration, are also used for communication, and are important for the trained voice user to master, but are more rarely used in the formal phonetic code of a spoken language.\n\n==Physiology and vocal timbre==\nThe sound of each individual's voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body, especially the vocal tract, and the manner in which the speech sounds are habitually formed and articulated. (It is this latter aspect of the sound of the voice that can be mimicked by skilled performers.) Humans have vocal folds that can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume, timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body, and an individual's size and bone structure can affect somewhat the sound produced by an individual.\n\nSingers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx, which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].<ref name=Vennard>{{cite book\n|title= singing: The Mechanism and the Technic\n|last= Vennard\n|first= William\n|year= 1967\n|publisher= Carl Fischer\n|isbn= 978-0-8258-0055-9}}</ref> The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the [[Singer's Formant]], which has been shown to be a resonance added to the normal resonances of the vocal tract above the frequency range of most instruments and so enables the singer's voice to carry better over musical accompaniment.<ref>Sundberg, Johan, The Acoustics of the Singing Voice, Scientific American Mar 77, p82\n</ref><ref>E.

A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal folds]], and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in ''[[larynx|laryngeal]]'' functioning. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Chest\u2010 and falsetto\u2010like oscillations in a two\u2010mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355\u20133359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}</ref> Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular ''Vocal range'' of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.<ref name=Large>{{cite journal\n|last=Large\n|first= John\n|date=February\u2013March 1972\n|title= Towards an Integrated Physiologic-Acoustic Theory of Vocal Registers\n|journal= The NATS Bulletin\n|volume= 28\n|pages= 30\u201335}}</ref> The occurrence of registers has also been attributed to effects of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Effect of source\u2013tract acoustical coupling on the oscillation onset of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 2012|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 403\u2013411|volume = 132|issue = 1|doi = 10.1121/1.4728170|pmid = 22779487|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero|first2 = K\u00e9lem G.|last2 = Louren\u00e7o|first3 = Nicolas|last3 = Hermant|first4 = Annemie Van|last4 = Hirtum|first5 = Xavier|last5 = Pelorson|bibcode = 2012ASAJ..132..403L|url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00726367/file/LucEtAlJASA2012.pdf}}</ref> The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:<ref name = McKinney/>\n* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.\n* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].\n* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process.\n* A certain vocal [[timbre]].\n* A region of the voice that is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.\n* A subset of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.\n\nIn [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language that combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system.\n\nWithin [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists.<ref name=McKinney />\n\n===Vocal resonation===\n{{main|Vocal resonation}}\n'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation; although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.<ref name=McKinney>{{cite book\n|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults\n|last= McKinney\n|first= James\n|year= 1994\n|publisher= Genovex Music Group\n|isbn= 978-1-56593-940-0}}</ref>\nThere are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators.

Adult male voices are usually lower-pitched and have larger folds. The male vocal folds (which would be measured vertically in the opposite diagram), are between 17&nbsp;mm and 25&nbsp;mm in length.<ref>Thurman, Leon & Welch, ed., Graham (2000), Body mind & voice: Foundations of voice education (revised ed.), Collegeville, Minnesota: The Voice Care Network et al., {{ISBN|0-87414-123-0}}</ref> The female vocal folds are between 12.5&nbsp;mm and 17.5&nbsp;mm in length.\n\nThe folds are within the [[larynx]]. They are attached at the back (side nearest the spinal cord) to the ''arytenoids cartilages'', and at the front (side under the chin) to the [[thyroid]] cartilage. They have no outer edge as they blend into the side of the [[Vertebrate trachea|breathing tube]] (the illustration is out of date and does not show this well) while their inner edges or \"margins\" are free to vibrate (the hole). They have a three layer construction of an [[epithelium]], vocal ligament, then muscle ([[vocalis muscle]]), which can shorten and bulge the folds. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the vocal cord is the [[vestibular fold]] or ''false vocal cord'', which has a small [[wikt:sac|sac]] between its two folds.\n\nThe difference in vocal folds size between men and women means that they have differently pitched voices. Additionally, [[genetics]] also causes variances amongst the same sex, with men's and women's [[singing]] voices being categorized into types. For example, among men, there are [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]] (ranging from [[scientific pitch notation|E2 to D7 and higher]]), and among women, [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (ranging from F3 to C6 and higher). There are additional categories for [[Opera#Operatic voices|operatic voices]], see [[voice type]]. This is not the only source of difference between male and female voice. Men, generally speaking, have a larger [[vocal tract]], which essentially gives the resultant voice a lower-sounding [[timbre]]. This is mostly independent of the vocal folds themselves.\n\n==Voice modulation in spoken language==\nHuman spoken language makes use of the ability of almost all people in a given society to dynamically modulate certain parameters of the laryngeal voice source in a consistent manner. The most important communicative, or phonetic, parameters are the voice pitch (determined by the vibratory frequency of the vocal folds) and the degree of separation of the vocal folds, referred to as vocal fold adduction (coming together) or abduction (separating).<ref name=\"Rothenberg_BSD\">[http://www.rothenberg.org/Breath-Stream/BSD_contents.htm Rothenberg, M. ''The Breath-Stream Dynamics of Simple-Released Plosive Production'', Vol. 6, Bibliotheca Phonetica, Karger, Basel, 1968.]</ref>\n\nThe ability to vary the ab/adduction of the vocal folds quickly has a strong genetic component, since vocal fold adduction has a life-preserving function in keeping food from passing into the lungs, in addition to the covering action of the epiglottis. Consequently, the muscles that control this action are among the fastest in the body.<ref name=\"Rothenberg_BSD\" /> Children can learn to use this action consistently during speech at an early age, as they learn to speak the difference between utterances such as \"apa\" (having an abductory-adductory gesture for the p) as \"aba\" (having no abductory-adductory gesture).<ref name=\"Rothenberg_BSD\" /> Surprisingly enough, they can learn to do this well before the age of two by listening only to the voices of adults around them who have voices much different from their own, and even though the laryngeal movements causing these phonetic differentiations are deep in the throat and not visible to them.\n\nIf an abductory movement or adductory movement is strong enough, the vibrations of the vocal folds will stop (or not start). If the gesture is abductory and is part of a speech sound, the sound will be called [[voiceless]]. However, voiceless speech sounds are sometimes better identified as containing an abductory gesture, even if the gesture was not strong enough to stop the vocal folds from vibrating. This anomalous feature of voiceless speech sounds is better understood if it is realized that it is the change in the spectral qualities of the voice as abduction proceeds that is the primary acoustic attribute that the listener attends to when identifying a voiceless speech sound, and not simply the presence or absence of voice (periodic energy).<ref name=\"Rothenberg_IF\">[http://www.rothenberg.org/Glottal/glottal.pdf Rothenberg, M. The glottal volume velocity waveform during loose and tight voiced glottal adjustments, Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, 22-28 August 1971 ed. by A. Rigault and R. Charbonneau, published in 1972 by Mouton, The Hague \u2013 Paris.]</ref>\n\nAn adductory gesture is also identified by the change in voice spectral energy it produces. Thus, a speech sound having an adductory gesture may be referred to as a \"glottal stop\" even if the vocal fold vibrations do not entirely stop.<ref name=\"Rothenberg_IF\"/>\n\nOther aspects of the voice, such as variations in the regularity of vibration, are also used for communication, and are important for the trained voice user to master, but are more rarely used in the formal phonetic code of a spoken language.\n\n==Physiology and vocal timbre==\nThe sound of each individual's voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body, especially the vocal tract, and the manner in which the speech sounds are habitually formed and articulated. (It is this latter aspect of the sound of the voice that can be mimicked by skilled performers.) Humans have vocal folds that can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume, timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body, and an individual's size and bone structure can affect somewhat the sound produced by an individual.\n\nSingers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx, which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].<ref name=Vennard>{{cite book\n|title= singing: The Mechanism and the Technic\n|last= Vennard\n|first= William\n|year= 1967\n|publisher= Carl Fischer\n|isbn= 978-0-8258-0055-9}}</ref> The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the [[Singer's Formant]], which has been shown to be a resonance added to the normal resonances of the vocal tract above the frequency range of most instruments and so enables the singer's voice to carry better over musical accompaniment.<ref>Sundberg, Johan, The Acoustics of the Singing Voice, Scientific American Mar 77, p82\n</ref><ref>E.

A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal folds]], and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in ''[[larynx|laryngeal]]'' functioning. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Chest\u2010 and falsetto\u2010like oscillations in a two\u2010mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355\u20133359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}</ref> Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular ''Vocal range'' of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.<ref name=Large>{{cite journal\n|last=Large\n|first= John\n|date=February\u2013March 1972\n|title= Towards an Integrated Physiologic-Acoustic Theory of Vocal Registers\n|journal= The NATS Bulletin\n|volume= 28\n|pages= 30\u201335}}</ref> The occurrence of registers has also been attributed to effects of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Effect of source\u2013tract acoustical coupling on the oscillation onset of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 2012|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 403\u2013411|volume = 132|issue = 1|doi = 10.1121/1.4728170|pmid = 22779487|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero|first2 = K\u00e9lem G.|last2 = Louren\u00e7o|first3 = Nicolas|last3 = Hermant|first4 = Annemie Van|last4 = Hirtum|first5 = Xavier|last5 = Pelorson|bibcode = 2012ASAJ..132..403L|url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00726367/file/LucEtAlJASA2012.pdf}}</ref> The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:<ref name = McKinney/>\n* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.\n* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].\n* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process.\n* A certain vocal [[timbre]].\n* A region of the voice that is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.\n* A subset of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.\n\nIn [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language that combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system.\n\nWithin [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists.<ref name=McKinney />\n\n===Vocal resonation===\n{{main|Vocal resonation}}\n'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation; although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.<ref name=McKinney>{{cite book\n|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults\n|last= McKinney\n|first= James\n|year= 1994\n|publisher= Genovex Music Group\n|isbn= 978-1-56593-940-0}}</ref>\nThere are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators.

He also developed a blowing device for [[blast furnace]]s that allowed higher temperatures, increasing their efficiency.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJohn Wilkinson was born in [[Little Clifton]], [[Bridgefoot]], [[Cumberland]] (now part of [[Cumbria]]), the eldest son of [[Isaac Wilkinson]] and Mary Johnson. Isaac was then the [[potfounder]] at the [[blast furnace]] there,<ref>W. H. Chaloner, 'Isaac Wilkinson, potfounder' in L. S. Pressnell (ed.), ''Studies in the industrial revolution presented to T.S. Ashton'' (Athlone Press, Univ. of London 1960), 23\u201351.</ref> one of the first to use [[coke (fuel)|coke]] instead of charcoal, which was pioneered by [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]].\n\nJohn and his half-brother William, who was 17 years younger, were raised in a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] [[Presbyterian]] family and he was educated at a [[Dissenting academies|dissenting academy]] at Kendal, run by Dr [[Caleb Rotherham]].<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris J R</ref> His sister Mary married another non-conformist, [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1762.  Priestley also played a role in educating John's younger brother, William.\n\nIn 1745, when John was 17, he was apprenticed to a [[Liverpool]] merchant for five years and then entered into partnership with his father.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>\n\nWhen his father moved to [[Bersham Ironworks|Bersham furnace]] near [[Wrexham]] in 1753 John remained at [[Kirkby Lonsdale]] in [[Westmorland]] where he married Ann Maudesley on 12 June 1755.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>\n\n===Iron master===\n\nFrom 1755 John Wilkinson became a partner in the Bersham concern and in 1757 with partners, he erected a blast furnace at [[Willey, Shropshire|Willey]], near [[Broseley]] in Shropshire.<ref>B. Trinder, ''The Industrial Revolution in Shropshire'' (2000), 42.</ref> Later he built another furnace and works at New Willey.  He made his home in Broseley in a house called 'The Lawns' which became his headquarters for many years.  He had houses either side of 'The Lawns' which served for administration, one being named 'The Mint' used for distribution of the thousands of tokens, each valued equivalent to a halfpenny.  In East Shropshire he also developed iron works at Snedshill, Hollinswood, [[Hadley, Shropshire|Hadley]] and [[Hampton Loade]].   He and Edward Blakeway also leased land to build another at [[Bradley, West Midlands|Bradley]] works in [[Bilston]] parish, near [[Wolverhampton]].<ref>Herefordshire Record Office, E12/S/378, 20 October 1784.</ref> He became known as the Father of the extensive South Staffordshire iron industry with Bilston as the start of the [[Black Country]].   In 1761, he took over [[Bersham]] Ironworks as well.  Bradley became his largest and most successful enterprise, and was the site of extensive experiments in getting raw coal to substitute for [[Coke (coal)|coke]] in the production of [[cast iron]].  At its peak, it included a number of [[blast furnace]]s, a brick works, potteries, glass works, and [[rolling mill]]s.  The [[Birmingham Canal]] was subsequently built near the Bradley works.\n\n==Inventions==\nWilkinson was a prolific inventor of new products and processes, and especially anything connected with novel uses of [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]]. His development of a [[machine tool]] for boring cast iron cannons presaged the accurate boring of cylinders for the first Watt steam engines. He also improved the air supply for the [[blast furnace]] using a new design of [[bellows]], and was the first to use wrought iron in canal barges. He supported the construction of the first important cast iron bridge at [[Coalbrookdale]].\n\n===Cannon boring machine===\nBersham became well known for high-quality casting and a producer of guns and cannon. Historically cannons had been cast with a core and then bored to remove imperfections, but in 1774 Wilkinson patented a technique for boring iron guns from a solid piece, rotating the gun barrel rather than the boring-bar. This technique made the guns more accurate and less likely to explode. While bronze cannon were already being bored from the solid, the boring of large naval iron cannon was novel. The patent was quashed in 1779 (the navy saw it as a monopoly and sought to overthrow it) but Wilkinson still remained a major manufacturer.<ref name=\"Harris\"/>\n\nIn 1792 Wilkinson bought the [[Brymbo Hall]] estate in [[Denbighshire]], not far from Bersham, where furnaces and other plant were installed.<ref name=\"Harris\"/> After his death and the decline of his industrial empire, the ironworks lay idle for some years until in 1842.<ref>[http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/brymbo_steelworks/scottish.htm Brymbo Steelworks \u2013 the Scottish connection], Wrexham County Borough Council</ref> It became once again an important works and eventually became [[Brymbo Steelworks]], which continued to operate until 1990.<ref name=wcbc2>[http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/english/heritage/brymbo_steelworks/last_tap.htm Brymbo Steelworks \u2013 The last tap], Wrexham County Borough Council</ref>\n\n===Boring machine for steam engines===\n[[File:WattsSteamEngine.jpeg|thumbnail|240px|[[Steam engine]] by [[James Watt]] (1797)]]\n\n[[James Watt]] had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain accurately bored cylinders for his steam engines, and was forced to use hammered iron, which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston.  In 1774 John Wilkinson invented a boring machine in which the shaft that held the cutting tool extended through the cylinder and was supported on both ends, unlike the [[cantilever]]ed borers then in use. With this machine he was able to bore the cylinder for [[Boulton and Watt|Boulton & Watt]]'s first commercial engine, and was given an exclusive contract for the provision of cylinders.<ref>{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}.

Among his many inventions was a reversing [[rolling mill]] with two steam cylinders that made the process much more economical.\n\nJohn Wilkinson took a key interest in obtaining orders for these more efficient steam engines and other uses for cast iron from the owners of Cornish copper mines. As part of this interest he bought shares in eight of the mines to help provide capital.\n\n===Hydraulic blowing engine===\nIn 1757 Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered [[blowing engine]] to increase the air blast through the [[tuyeres]] for blast furnaces, so improving the rate of production of cast iron.  The historian [[Joseph Needham]] likened Wilkinson's design to the one described in 1313 by the Chinese Imperial Government metallurgist [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] in his [[Wang Zhen (official)#Technical innovations|''Treatise on Agriculture'']].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention\n |last1=Temple\n |first1= Robert\n|authorlink= \n|author2=Joseph Needham\n|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster\n|location=New York\n|isbn= |pages=65\n| postscript = <Based on the works of Joseph Needham>}}\n</ref>\n\n==Iron Bridge==\n[[File:Ironbridge002.JPG|thumbnail|350px|[[The Iron Bridge]]]]\n\nIn 1775 John Wilkinson was the prime mover initiating the building of [[the Iron Bridge]] connecting the then-important industrial town of Broseley with the other side of the [[River Severn]].  His friend [[Thomas Farnolls Pritchard]], had written to him with plans for the bridge.  A committee of subscribers was formed, mostly including Broseley businessmen, to agree to the use of iron rather than wood or stone and obtain price quotations and an authorising act of Parliament.\n\nWilkinson's persuasion and drive held together the group support through several problems during the parliamentary process.  Had Wilkinson not succeeded in this and also drawn support from influential parliamentarians, the bridge might not have been built or might have been made of other materials.  Consequently, the name 'Ironbridge' would not have been coined for the district in Madeley; the area would not have attained the status of a [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Abraham Darby III]] was chosen as the preferred builder after quoting to build the bridge for \u00a33,150/-/-.  When construction started, Wilkinson sold his shares to Abraham Darby III in 1777, leaving the latter to steer the project to its successful conclusion in 1779 and be opened in 1781.\n\nIn 1787 he launched the first [[wrought iron]], [[barge]], constructed in [[Broseley]]. It was a development which would become common over the years ahead and in large ships in the following century. He patented several other inventions.\n\n==Copper interests==\n[[File:Parys mountain.jpg|thumbnail|350px|[[Parys Mountain]] opencast copper mine]]\nJohn Wilkinson made his fortune selling good quality goods made of iron and reached his limit of investment expansion.  His expertise proved useful when he invested in many copper interests.  In 1761 the Royal Navy clad the hull of the frigate {{HMS|Alarm|1758|6}} with copper sheet to reduce the growth of marine biofouling and prevent attack by the [[Teredo navalis|Teredo shipworm]]. The drag from the hull growth cut the speed and the shipworm caused severe hull damage, especially in tropical waters. After the success of this work the Navy decreed that all ships should be clad and this created a large demand for copper that Wilkinson noted during his visits to shipyards.  He bought shares in eight Cornish copper mines and met [[Thomas Williams of Llanidan|Thomas Williams]], the 'Copper King' of the [[Parys Mountain]] mines in [[Anglesey]].  Besides supplying Williams with large quantities of plate and equipment, Wilkinson also supplied scrap for the process of recovery of copper from solution by cementation.  Wilkinson bought a 1/16th share in the Mona Mine at Parys Mountain and shares in Williams industries at [[Holywell, Flintshire]], St Helens, near Liverpool and [[Swansea]], South Wales.  Wilkinson and Williams worked together on several projects. They were amongst the first to issue trade tokens ('Willys' and 'Druids') to alleviate the shortage of small coins. Jointly they set up the Cornish Metal Company in 1785 as a marketing company for copper. Its aim was to ensure both a good return for the Cornish miners and a stable price for the users of copper. Warehouses were set up in Birmingham, London, Bristol and Liverpool.\n\nTo help his business interests and to service his trade tokens, Wilkinson bought into partnerships with banks in Birmingham, Bilston, Bradley, Brymbo and [[Shrewsbury]].\n\n==Lead mines and works==\n\nWilkinson bought lead mines at [[Minera]] in Wrexham, five miles from Bersham, Llyn Pandy at Soughton (now [[Sychdyn]]) and Mold, also in Flintshire.  He installed steam pumping engines to make them viable again.  His lead was exported through the port of [[Chester]]. To use some of the lead produced, Wilkinson had a lead pipe works at [[Rotherhithe]], London.  This factory lasted for many years eventually making the solder filler alloys used in the car factory at [[Dagenham]].\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:PriestleyPeale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Priestley]], painted late in life by [[Rembrandt Peale]]]]\n\n\nWilkinson had a good reputation as an employer. Wherever new works were established, cottages were built to accommodate employees and their families. He gave significant financial support to his brother-in-law, the famous chemist Dr [[Joseph Priestley]]. He became a church warden in Broseley and was later elected [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire]]. In schools that had no slates he was able to provide iron troughs to hold sand for the practice of writing and arithmetic. He provided a cast-iron pulpit for the church at Bilston.\n\n==Family life, and death==\n\n[[File:Wilkinsontoken.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Wilkinson, as depicted on a 1793 [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] token struck by [[Matthew Boulton]]'s Soho Mint]]\nJohn married Ann Maudsley in 1759. Her family was wealthy and her [[dowry]] helped to pay for a share in the [[New Willey Company]]. After the death of Ann, his second marriage, when he was 35, was to Mary Lee, whose money helped him to buy out his partners. When he was in his seventies, his mistress Mary Ann Lewis, a maid at his estate in Brymbo Hall, gave birth to his only children, a boy and two girls.\n\nBy 1796, when he was 68, he was producing about one-eighth of Britain's cast iron.<ref>Soldon, p. 67</ref> He became \"a titan\" \u2013 very wealthy, and somewhat eccentric.  His \"iron madness\" reached a peak in the 1790s, when he had almost everything around him made of iron, even several [[coffin]]s and a massive [[obelisk]] to mark his grave, which still stands in the village of [[Lindale, Cumbria|Lindale-in-Cartmel]], now in [[Cumbria]]. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire|Sheriff of Denbighshire]] for 1799.<ref>{{cite book|title = Annals of the Counties and County Families of Wales|url = https://archive.org/details/annalsandantiqu00goog|first= Thomas|last= Nicholas}}</ref>\n\nHe died on 14 July 1808 at his works in [[Bradley, West Midlands|Bradley]], probably from [[diabetes]]. He was originally buried at his Castlehead estate at Lindale.\n\nHe left a very large estate in his will (more than \u00a3130,000 - equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|130000|1808|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, to which he intended to make his three children the principal heirs, with executors to manage the estate for them. However his nephew Thomas Jones contested the will in the [[Court of Chancery]]. By 1828, the estate had largely been dissipated by lawsuits and poor management. His corpse, in its distinctive iron coffin, was moved several times over the next decades, but is now lost.<ref>Soldon, pp 347\u2013348</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Soldon, Norbert C.

Warehouses were set up in Birmingham, London, Bristol and Liverpool.\n\nTo help his business interests and to service his trade tokens, Wilkinson bought into partnerships with banks in Birmingham, Bilston, Bradley, Brymbo and [[Shrewsbury]].\n\n==Lead mines and works==\n\nWilkinson bought lead mines at [[Minera]] in Wrexham, five miles from Bersham, Llyn Pandy at Soughton (now [[Sychdyn]]) and Mold, also in Flintshire.  He installed steam pumping engines to make them viable again.  His lead was exported through the port of [[Chester]]. To use some of the lead produced, Wilkinson had a lead pipe works at [[Rotherhithe]], London.  This factory lasted for many years eventually making the solder filler alloys used in the car factory at [[Dagenham]].\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:PriestleyPeale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Priestley]], painted late in life by [[Rembrandt Peale]]]]\n\n\nWilkinson had a good reputation as an employer. Wherever new works were established, cottages were built to accommodate employees and their families. He gave significant financial support to his brother-in-law, the famous chemist Dr [[Joseph Priestley]]. He became a church warden in Broseley and was later elected [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire]]. In schools that had no slates he was able to provide iron troughs to hold sand for the practice of writing and arithmetic. He provided a cast-iron pulpit for the church at Bilston.\n\n==Family life, and death==\n\n[[File:Wilkinsontoken.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Wilkinson, as depicted on a 1793 [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] token struck by [[Matthew Boulton]]'s Soho Mint]]\nJohn married Ann Maudsley in 1759. Her family was wealthy and her [[dowry]] helped to pay for a share in the [[New Willey Company]]. After the death of Ann, his second marriage, when he was 35, was to Mary Lee, whose money helped him to buy out his partners. When he was in his seventies, his mistress Mary Ann Lewis, a maid at his estate in Brymbo Hall, gave birth to his only children, a boy and two girls.\n\nBy 1796, when he was 68, he was producing about one-eighth of Britain's cast iron.<ref>Soldon, p. 67</ref> He became \"a titan\" \u2013 very wealthy, and somewhat eccentric.  His \"iron madness\" reached a peak in the 1790s, when he had almost everything around him made of iron, even several [[coffin]]s and a massive [[obelisk]] to mark his grave, which still stands in the village of [[Lindale, Cumbria|Lindale-in-Cartmel]], now in [[Cumbria]]. He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire|Sheriff of Denbighshire]] for 1799.<ref>{{cite book|title = Annals of the Counties and County Families of Wales|url = https://archive.org/details/annalsandantiqu00goog|first= Thomas|last= Nicholas}}</ref>\n\nHe died on 14 July 1808 at his works in [[Bradley, West Midlands|Bradley]], probably from [[diabetes]]. He was originally buried at his Castlehead estate at Lindale.\n\nHe left a very large estate in his will (more than \u00a3130,000 - equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|130000|1808|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}, to which he intended to make his three children the principal heirs, with executors to manage the estate for them. However his nephew Thomas Jones contested the will in the [[Court of Chancery]]. By 1828, the estate had largely been dissipated by lawsuits and poor management. His corpse, in its distinctive iron coffin, was moved several times over the next decades, but is now lost.<ref>Soldon, pp 347\u2013348</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Soldon, Norbert C.
