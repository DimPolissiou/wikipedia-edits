{"title_page": "Marxist criminology", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=August 2014}}\n{{Marxism|Aspects}}\n\n{{Criminology and penology|schools}}\n\n'''Marxist criminology''' is one of the [[School (discipline)|schools]] of [[criminology]]. It parallels the work of the [[structural functionalism]] school which focuses on what produces stability and continuity in [[society]] but, unlike the functionalists, it adopts a predefined [[political philosophy]]. As in [[conflict criminology]], it focuses on why things change, identifying the disruptive forces in industrialized societies, and describing how society is divided by power, wealth, prestige, and the perceptions of the world. \"The shape and character of the legal system in complex societies can be understood as deriving from the conflicts inherent in the structure of these societies which are stratified economically and politically\" (Chambliss, 1971, p3). It is concerned with the causal relationships between society and crime, i.e. to establish a critical understanding of how the immediate and structural social environment gives rise to crime and criminogenic conditions.\n\n[[Karl Marx]] argued that the [[law]] is the mechanism by which one [[social class]], usually referred to as the \"[[ruling class]]\", keeps all the other classes in a disadvantaged position.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Criminological Theory: The Essentials|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XPA44ThcnJkC|publisher = SAGE Publications|date = 2011-04-06|isbn = 9781412992343|language = en|first = Stephen G.|last = Tibbetts}}</ref> Thus, this school uses a Marxist lens through which, ''inter alia'' (among other things), to consider the criminalization process, and by which explain why some acts are defined as [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant]] whereas others are not. It is therefore interested in [[political crime]], [[state crime]], and [[state-corporate crime]]. \n\n==Discussion==\nMarxism provides a systematic theoretical basis upon which to interrogate social structural arrangements, and the hypothesis that economic power is translated into political power substantially accounts for the general disempowerment of the majority who live in the modern state and the limitations of political [[discourse]]. Hence, whether directly or indirectly, it informs much of the research into social phenomena not only in criminology, but also in [[semiotics]] and the other disciplines which explore the structural relationships of power, knowledge, meaning, and positional interests within society.\n\nMany criminologists agree{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that for a society to function efficiently, social order is necessary and that conformity is induced through a [[socialization]] process. \"Law\" is the label given to one of the means used to enforce the interests of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Hence, because each state is [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the law can be used for any purpose. It is also common ground that, whether the society is [[meritocratic]], [[democracy|democratic]] or [[autocratic]], a small group emerges to lead. The reason for this group's emergence may be their ability to use power more effectively, or simple expediency in that, as population size grows, the delegation of decision-making powers to a group representative of the majority leads to more efficiency. Marxists are critical of the ideas, values, and norms of capitalist ideology, and characterize the modern state as being under the control of the group that owns the means of production. For example, [[William Chambliss]] (1973) examined the way in which the [[vagrancy]] laws were amended to reflect the interests of the ruling elite. He also looked at how British Colonial Law was applied in East Africa, so that the capitalist \"ruling class\" could profit from coffee plantations,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  and how the law in medieval England benefited feudal landowners.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Similarly, Pearce (2003) looks at evidence that corporate crime is widespread but is rarely prosecuted.\n\nThese researchers assert that political power is used to reinforce [[economic inequality]] by embedding individual property rights in the law and that the resulting poverty is one of the causes of criminal activity as a means of survival. Marxists argue that a socialist society with communal ownership of the means of production would have much less crime. Indeed, Milton Mankoff asserts that there is much less crime in Western Europe than in the United States because Europe is more \u2018Socialist\u2019 than America. The implication of such views is that the solution to the \"crime problem\" is to engage in a socialist revolution.\n\nA different issue emerges by applying [[Marx's theory of alienation]]. A proportion of crime is said to be the result of society offering only demeaning work with little sense of creativity. However, the characterization of some crime as \"working-class crime\" and portraying it as a response to oppression is problematic. It selectively labels crime committed by people simply on the basis of their membership of a class, without engaging in [[victimology]] to identify whether any particular class or group is most likely to be the victim of such crime (because many criminals are disinclined to travel far, working-class crime is often directed at working-class people who live in the same neighborhood). In fact, the social differentiation of crime may vary by age, class, ethnicity, gender, demographic, and locality. This can cause some individuals to be at greater risk to victimization simply based on their location or even daily routine. According to Miethe and Stafford, different roles correlate to risks of victimization, and \"structural changes in activity patterns influence crime rates.\" The three necessary elements of victimization include \"motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absence of capable guardians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miethe|first=Terance D.|last2=Stafford|first2=Mark C.|last3=Long|first3=J. Scott|date=1987|title=Social Differentiation in Criminal Victimization: A Test of Routine Activities/Lifestyle Theories|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=52|issue=2|pages=184\u2013194|doi=10.2307/2095447|issn=0003-1224|jstor=2095447}}</ref>\"\n\nFurther, if ''[[anomie]]'' (the feeling one has when there is no longer any type of regulation or predictability in one\u2019s life) is a primary cause of crime, there should be a [[theory]] to explain why only some working-class people commit crimes. According to Charles R. Tittle, anomie can be considered one of eight theories or schools that \u201c[imply] a negative association between socioeconomic status and the probability of criminal behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tittle|first=Charles R.|date=1983|title=Social Class and Criminal Behavior: A Critique of the Theoretical Foundation|journal=Social Forces|volume=62|issue=2|pages=334\u2013358|doi=10.2307/2578311|issn=0037-7732|jstor=2578311}}</ref>\u201d But if there is evidence that some individuals and, in some cases, entire groups are [[social alienation|alienated]] from mainstream society, there should be detailed research into the effect that this has on society as a whole (see [[normlessness]]). In such research, Marxism tends to focus on societal forces rather than the motives of individuals and their dualistic capacity for both right and wrong, moral and immoral. This can lead to a less comprehensive explanation of why people exercise their autonomy by choosing to act in particular ways. By comparison, in the [[sociology of deviance]], [[Robert K. Merton]] borrows [[Durkheim]]'s concept of ''anomie'' to form the [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain Theory]]. Merton argues that the real problem of alienation is not created by a sudden social change, as Durkheim proposed, but rather by a social structure that holds out the same goals to all its members without giving them equal means to achieve them. It is this lack of integration between what the culture calls for and what the structure permits that causes deviant behavior. Deviance then is a symptom of the social structure. Taylor et al. intend a combination of Interactionism and Marxism as a radical alternative to previous theories to formulate a \"fully social theory of deviance\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new criminology : for a social theory of deviance|last=Taylor, Ian R.|others=Walton, Paul., Young, Jock.|isbn=978-0-415-85586-0|location=London|oclc=827528457|year = 2013}}</ref> \n \nAccording to the Oxford dictionary, deviance can be defined as \"departing from usual or accepted standards, especially in social or sexual behavior.\" The power to label behavior as \"deviant\" arises partly from the unequal distribution of power within the state, and because the judgment carries the authority of the state, it attributes greater stigma to the prohibited behavior. This is true no matter what the political orientation of the state. All states enact laws which, to a greater or lesser extent, protect property. This may take the form of [[theft]], or prohibit damage or trespass. Even though a theft law may not appear judgmental, a Marxist analysis of the conviction rates may detect inequalities in the way in which the law is applied.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Thus, the decision whether to prosecute or to convict may be skewed by having the resources to employ a good [[lawyer]]. The same analysis may also show that the distribution of [[punishment]] for any given crime may vary according to the social class of the perpetrator. But, the law of theft exists to protect the interests of all those who own property. It does not discriminate by reference to the class of the owner. Indeed, few laws in any states are drafted to protect property interests by reference to class, and the acceptance and enforcement of laws generally depend on a consensus within the community that such laws meet local needs. In this, a comparison of the crime rates between states shows little correlation by reference to political orientation. Such correlations as do exist tend to reflect disparities between rich and poor, and features describing the development of the social and economic environment. Hence, the crimes rates are comparable in states where there are the largest disparities of wealth distribution, regardless of whether they are first, second or third world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n[[Ronald L. Akers]] has criticized Marxist criminology on the grounds that societies based on Marxist principles \"have been unjust and repressive and do not represent a future for which criminologists should strive\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Akers |first=Ronald L. |date=1979-02-01 |title=Theory and Ideology in Marxist Criminology |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=527\u2013544 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1979.tb01391.x |issn=1745-9125}}</ref>\n\n==Individual theorists==\n\n===Willem Adriaan Bonger===\nDutch criminologist Willem Bonger believed in a causal link between crime and economic and social conditions. He asserted that crime is social in origin and a normal response to prevailing cultural conditions. In more primitive societies, he contended that survival requires more selfless [[altruism]] within the community. But once agricultural technology improved and a surplus of food was generated, systems of exchange and barter began offering the opportunity for selfishness. As capitalism emerged, there were social forces of competition and wealth, resulting in an unequal distribution of resources, avarice and individualism.  Once self-interest and more egoistic impulses assert themselves, crime emerges. The poor would commit crime out of need or out of a sense of injustice. Hence, those with power exercise control and impose punishment, equating the definition of crime with harm or threat of harm to the property and business interests of the powerful. Although the inherent activities comprising, say, a theft, may be identical, theft by the poor will be given greater emphasis than theft by the rich. This will have two consequences: direct which will increase the pressure for survival in an unequal society, and indirect in that it will increase a sense of alienation among the poor. Crime in the streets was a result of the miserable conditions in which workers lived in competition with one another. He believed that poverty alone could not be a cause of crime but rather poverty coupled with individualism, materialism, false needs, racism, and the false masculinity of violence and domination among street thugs.\n\n===Thorsten Sellin===\n[[Thorsten Sellin|Sellin]] was a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the pioneers of scientific criminology. His method involved a comprehensive view of the subject incorporating historical, sociological, psychological, and legal factors into the analysis. He applied both Marxism and Conflict Theory to an examination of the cultural diversity of modern industrial society. In a homogeneous society, norms or codes of behavior will emerge and become laws where enforcement is necessary to preserve the unitary culture. But where separate cultures diverge from the mainstream, those minority groups will establish their own norms. Socialization will therefore be to the subgroup and to the mainstream norms. When laws are enacted, they will represent the norms, values and interests of the dominant cultural or ethnic groups in a state which may produce Border Culture Conflict. When the two cultures interact and one seeks to extend its influence into the other, each side is likely to react protectively. If the balance of power is relatively equal, an accommodation will usually be reached. But if the distribution of power is unequal, the everyday behavior of the minority group may be defined as deviant. The more diversified and heterogeneous a society becomes, the greater the probability of more frequent conflict as subgroups who live by their own rules break the rules of other groups.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Bonger, Willem.

The only two biblical reference to the ''maror'' is the verse quoted above (Exodus 12:8) in which it is mentioned in reference to the offering, and in Numbers 9:11 where \"They are to eat the lamb, together with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs\".<ref name=\"MC\"/> This is in contradistinction to the obligation to consume ''[[matzo]]'' on the first night of Passover, which remains a biblical commandment even in the absence of the Paschal Lamb, because there are other biblical verses that mention ''matzo'' as a standalone obligation (Exodus 12:18, Deuteronomy 16:8)\n\nThe word derives from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''mar'' (\u05de\u05b5\u05e8 or \u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 \u2013 \"bitter\"), and thus may be related to the English word [[myrrh]] (through \u00a0[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] \u0721\u072a\u071d\u072a\u0710 ''mriro'', in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] \u0645\u0631\u0651 ''murr'').\n\n==Symbolism==\nAccording to the [[Haggadah]], the traditional text which is recited at the Seder and which defines the Seder's form and customs, the maror symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The following verse from the [[Torah]] underscores that symbolism: \"And they embittered (''ve-yimareru'' \u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05e8\u05d5) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1:14).\n\n==Use at the Seder==\n{{Seder plate}}\nMaror is one of the foods placed on the [[Passover Seder Plate]] and there is a rabbinical requirement to eat ''maror'' at the Seder. ''Chazeret'' ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea}}) is used for the requirement called ''korech'', in which the maror is eaten together with ''matzo''. There are various customs about the kinds of ''maror'' placed at each location.\n\nDuring the Seder, each participant recites a specific [[blessing]] over the ''maror'' and eats it. It is first dipped into the [[charoset]]&mdash;a brown, pebbly mixture which symbolizes the mortar with which the [[Israelite]]s bound bricks for the Egyptians.  The excess charoset is then shaken off and the maror is eaten.  The ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish Law) prescribes the minimum amount of ''maror'' that should be eaten to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] (a ''kazayis'' or ''[[kezayit]]'', literally meaning the volume of an [[olive]]) and the amount of time in which it should be consumed. To fulfill the obligation, the flavor of the ''maror'' must be unadulterated by cooking or preservatives, such as being soaked in vinegar.<ref>''[[Mishna]]'' ''[[Pesachim]]'' 2:6</ref>\n\n==Types of maror==\nThe [[Mishnah]]<ref>''Pesahim'' 2:6</ref> specifies five types of bitter herbs eaten on the night of Passover: ''\u1e25azzeret'' ([[lettuce]]), ''\u02bfulesh\u012bn'' ([[endive]]/[[chicory]]), ''temakha'', ''\u1e25ar\u1e25avina'' ([[Melilotus|sweet clover]] or [[Eryngium|Eryngium creticum]]), and ''maror'' (likely [[Sonchus oleraceus]], a type of [[dandelion]]). The most common vegetables used as bitter herbs are [[horseradish]] and [[romaine lettuce]].\n\n===Hazzeret===\nHazzaret is undoubtedly domestic lettuce<ref>Thus explained in Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]'s Commentary on Mishnah ''Uktzin'' 1:2 [3]; ''Sefer Arukh'', s.v. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea; Mishnah Commentary of [[Rabbi Nathan, President of the Academy]], s.v. Mishnah ''Kila'im'' 1:2; Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kefar Darom 2015, p. 77 {{OCLC|783455868}}[Hebrew].</ref>, and the word is cognate to other near-eastern terms for lettuce. While in the past, domestic lettuce was bitter, modern varieties are only slightly bitter or not at all, such as [[iceberg lettuce]] and [[romaine lettuce]]. [[Heirloom plant|Heirloom varieties]] of lettuce are still available to gardeners that are bitter. Romaine lettuce is the most commonly used variety, perhaps because it still preserves a slight bitter taste, though all domestic varieties constitute Hazzereth.\n\nRomaine lettuce is not initially bitter, but becomes so later on, which is symbolic of the experience of the Jews in Egypt.<ref>[[Talmud]], Pesachim 39a</ref> The \"later\" bitterness of lettuce refers to fact that lettuce plants become bitter after they \"bolt\" (flower), a process which occurs naturally when days lengthen or temperatures rise.<ref>[https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-lettuce-bolt-do-1402981 Why Lettuce Bolts and How to Stop It]</ref>\n\nWild or [[Lactuca serriola|prickly lettuce (''Lactuca serriola'')]], is listed in Tosefta Pisha as suitable for maror under the name \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05dc or \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05df. However, its absence from the approved list in the Mishnah and Talmud indicate that it is not halakhically suitable.\n\n===`Ulshin===\nThe second species listed in the Mishnah is `ulshin, which is a plural to refer to both wild and cultivated types<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.39a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en TB Pesahim 39 a]</ref> of plants in the genus [[Endive|Chicorium]].<ref>Yehuda Felix, ''Mareos Hamishna''.

Of these, the most commonly grown chervil in Israel is [[Chaetosciadium trichospermum]]. Cf. William Smith (ed.), ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', Third edition, New York 1858, s.v. \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\"gingidium\"), \"a kind of chervil.\" [[Ibn Baytar]], citing [[Galen]], explains ''Gingidium'' as rather meaning a species of [[wild carrot]] (e.g. ''Daucus gingidium'', or something similar). This view is accepted by [[Pliny the Elder]] who, in his ''Natural History'' (Book XX, ch. XVI), wrote: \"In [[Greater Syria|Syria]] very great pains are taken over kitchen-gardens; hence the Greek proverb: 'Syrians have plenty of vegetables.' They sow a vegetable called by some ''gingidion'' that is very like ''staphylinus'' (=parsnip; carrot), only it is slighter and more bitter, though its properties are the same. It is eaten, cooked or raw, with great advantage to the stomach, for it dries up all its humours, however deep these may lie.\"</ref>\n\nRabbi [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]], in his ''Tosafot Yom-Tov'', identified the Mishna's \"temakha\" with Yiddish \"chreyn\" ([[horseradish]]). This identification has long been recognized as problematic, as horseraddish does not grow natively in Israel and was not available to Jews in the Mishnaic period. Many Jews use [[horseradish]] condiment (a mixture of cooked horseradish, beetroot and sugar), though the [[Shulchan Aruch]] requires that maror be used as is, that is raw, and not cooked or mixed with salt, vinegar, sugar, lemon, or beets.<ref>Orach Chaim 473:5</ref>\n\n===Harhavina===\nThe identity of harhavina is somewhat disputed.<ref>El'ad Kapah, ''The Identification of the Mishna Plants According to Rabbi Nathan's Commentary of the Mishna'', Ramat-Gan 2007, p. 48 (Hebrew); Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teaching''s, Kfar Darom 2015, pp. 88\u201389 {{OCLC|783455868}}. The species is variously identified as a vine growing around palms, a type of thistle, or a type of acacia.</ref>\n\n===Maror===\nThe identity of this autohyponym which names the vegetables suitable for the mitzvah was preserved among the Jews of Yemen as the plant [[Sonchus oleraceus]], a type of [[dandelion]] native to Israel.<ref>[[Adin Steinsaltz]], ''Talmud Bavli \u2013 explained, punctuated and translated\", Pesachim, volume A, p. 276</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Maror}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Passover Footer}}\n\n[[Category:Passover foods]]\n[[Category:Passover seder]]\n[[Category:Jewish ceremonial food and drink]]\n[[Category:Positive Mitzvoth]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:3TypesMaror.jpg|thumb|Grated [[horseradish]] mixed with cooked beets (known as ''chrein''), [[romaine lettuce]], and horseradish root, which should be freshly grated]]\n[[File:Seder Plate.jpg|thumb|[[Passover Seder plate]].

There are various customs about the kinds of ''maror'' placed at each location.\n\nDuring the Seder, each participant recites a specific [[blessing]] over the ''maror'' and eats it. It is first dipped into the [[charoset]]&mdash;a brown, pebbly mixture which symbolizes the mortar with which the [[Israelite]]s bound bricks for the Egyptians.  The excess charoset is then shaken off and the maror is eaten.  The ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish Law) prescribes the minimum amount of ''maror'' that should be eaten to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] (a ''kazayis'' or ''[[kezayit]]'', literally meaning the volume of an [[olive]]) and the amount of time in which it should be consumed. To fulfill the obligation, the flavor of the ''maror'' must be unadulterated by cooking or preservatives, such as being soaked in vinegar.<ref>''[[Mishna]]'' ''[[Pesachim]]'' 2:6</ref>\n\n==Types of maror==\nThe [[Mishnah]]<ref>''Pesahim'' 2:6</ref> specifies five types of bitter herbs eaten on the night of Passover: ''\u1e25azzeret'' ([[lettuce]]), ''\u02bfulesh\u012bn'' ([[endive]]/[[chicory]]), ''temakha'', ''\u1e25ar\u1e25avina'' ([[Melilotus|sweet clover]] or [[Eryngium|Eryngium creticum]]), and ''maror'' (likely [[Sonchus oleraceus]], a type of [[dandelion]]). The most common vegetables used as bitter herbs are [[horseradish]] and [[romaine lettuce]].\n\n===Hazzeret===\nHazzaret is undoubtedly domestic lettuce<ref>Thus explained in Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]]'s Commentary on Mishnah ''Uktzin'' 1:2 [3]; ''Sefer Arukh'', s.v. \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea; Mishnah Commentary of [[Rabbi Nathan, President of the Academy]], s.v. Mishnah ''Kila'im'' 1:2; Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings'', Kefar Darom 2015, p. 77 {{OCLC|783455868}}[Hebrew].</ref>, and the word is cognate to other near-eastern terms for lettuce. While in the past, domestic lettuce was bitter, modern varieties are only slightly bitter or not at all, such as [[iceberg lettuce]] and [[romaine lettuce]]. [[Heirloom plant|Heirloom varieties]] of lettuce are still available to gardeners that are bitter. Romaine lettuce is the most commonly used variety, perhaps because it still preserves a slight bitter taste, though all domestic varieties constitute Hazzereth.\n\nRomaine lettuce is not initially bitter, but becomes so later on, which is symbolic of the experience of the Jews in Egypt.<ref>[[Talmud]], Pesachim 39a</ref> The \"later\" bitterness of lettuce refers to fact that lettuce plants become bitter after they \"bolt\" (flower), a process which occurs naturally when days lengthen or temperatures rise.<ref>[https://www.thespruce.com/what-does-lettuce-bolt-do-1402981 Why Lettuce Bolts and How to Stop It]</ref>\n\nWild or [[Lactuca serriola|prickly lettuce (''Lactuca serriola'')]], is listed in Tosefta Pisha as suitable for maror under the name \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d2\u05dc or \u05d7\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05df. However, its absence from the approved list in the Mishnah and Talmud indicate that it is not halakhically suitable.\n\n===`Ulshin===\nThe second species listed in the Mishnah is `ulshin, which is a plural to refer to both wild and cultivated types<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.39a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en TB Pesahim 39 a]</ref> of plants in the genus [[Endive|Chicorium]]<ref>Yehuda Felix, ''Mareos Hamishna''. [http://www.neveh.org/pesach/pesblm1.html Source] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317082009/http://www.neveh.org/pesach/pesblm1.html |date=2016-03-17 }}</ref>. The term is cognate to other near-eastern terms for endives, such as Aramaic \u05e2\u05dc\u05ea and Arabic `alath. \n\n===Tamcha===\nThe Talmud Yershalmi identified Hebrew Tamcha with Greek \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, which has been positively identified via the illustration in the [[Vienna Dioscurides]] as the carrot ''Daucus gingidium''<ref>The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Pesahim'' 2:5 [18a]) calls the '''\u05ea\u05de\u05db\u05d4''' by the name '''\u05d2\u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05df''' (''Gingidium''), which, according to [[Dioscorides]] (Book II\u2013167), is a kind of chervil, and can apply to any of the following genera: Chaerophyllum, Anthriscus, Chaetosciadium and Scandix. Of these, the most commonly grown chervil in Israel is [[Chaetosciadium trichospermum]]. Cf. William Smith (ed.), ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', Third edition, New York 1858, s.v. \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\"gingidium\"), \"a kind of chervil.\" [[Ibn Baytar]], citing [[Galen]], explains ''Gingidium'' as rather meaning a species of [[wild carrot]] (e.g. ''Daucus gingidium'', or something similar). This view is accepted by [[Pliny the Elder]] who, in his ''Natural History'' (Book XX, ch. XVI), wrote: \"In [[Greater Syria|Syria]] very great pains are taken over kitchen-gardens; hence the Greek proverb: 'Syrians have plenty of vegetables.' They sow a vegetable called by some ''gingidion'' that is very like ''staphylinus'' (=parsnip; carrot), only it is slighter and more bitter, though its properties are the same. It is eaten, cooked or raw, with great advantage to the stomach, for it dries up all its humours, however deep these may lie.\"</ref>.\n\nRabbi [[Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller]], in his ''Tosafot Yom-Tov'', identified the Mishna's \"temakha\" with Yiddish \"chreyn\" ([[horseradish]]). This identification has long been recognized as problematic, as horseraddish does not grow natively in Israel and was not available to Jews in the Mishnaic period. Many Jews use [[horseradish]] condiment (a mixture of cooked horseradish, beetroot and sugar), though the [[Shulchan Aruch]] requires that maror be used as is, that is raw, and not cooked or mixed with salt, vinegar, sugar, lemon, or beets.<ref>Orach Chaim 473:5</ref>\n\n===Harhavina===\nThe identity of harhavina is somewhat disputed.<ref>El'ad Kapah, ''The Identification of the Mishna Plants According to Rabbi Nathan's Commentary of the Mishna'', Ramat-Gan 2007, p. 48 (Hebrew); Zohar Amar, ''Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teaching''s, Kfar Darom 2015, pp. 88\u201389 {{OCLC|783455868}}. The species is variously identified as a vine growing around palms, a type of thistle, or a type of acacia.</ref>\n\n===Maror===\nThe identity of this autohyponym which names the vegetables suitable for the mitzvah was preserved among the Jews of Yemen as the plant [[Sonchus oleraceus]], a type of [[dandelion]] native to Israel.<ref>[[Adin Steinsaltz]], ''Talmud Bavli \u2013 explained, punctuated and translated\", Pesachim, volume A, p. 276</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Maror}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Passover Footer}}\n\n[[Category:Passover foods]]\n[[Category:Passover seder]]\n[[Category:Jewish ceremonial food and drink]]\n[[Category:Positive Mitzvoth]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maror"}

Marine conservation is properly conceived as a set of management strategies for the protection and preservation of [[ecosystem]]s in oceans and seas. Activists raise public awareness and support for conservation, while pushing governments and corporations to practice sound ocean management, create conservation policy, and enforce existing laws and policy through effective regulation.  There are many different kinds of organizations and agencies that work toward these common goals. They all are a part of the growing movement that is ocean conservation.  These organizations fight for many causes including stopping [[pollution]], [[overfishing]], [[whaling]] and [[by-catch]]ing, and supporting [[marine protected area]]s.\n\n==History==\n===United States===\nThough the [[environmental movement]] began in the United States during the 1960s, the idea of marine conservation really did not take off in the country until the 1972 [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act]] (MPRSA) passed, beginning the movement. The act allowed the regulation by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) over dumping in the seas.  Though the act was later amended, it was one of several key events to bring marine issues towards the front of environmental issues in the United States.\n\n=== Notable people ===\n* [[Jacques Cousteau]]: Explorer, Conservationist, Researcher & Author\n* [[Sylvia Earle]]: Marine Biologist, Explorer, & Author\n* [[Steve Irwin]]: Naturalist, Conservationist, Zoologist, Herpetologist, & Television Personality\n\n==== [[Ric O'Barry]] ====\nO'Barry is an author of the books ''Behind the Dolphin Smile''<ref name=\"O'BarryCoulbourn2000\">{{cite book |last1=O'Barry |first1=Richard |last2=Coulbourn |first2=Keith |title=Behind the Dolphin Smile: A True Story that Will Touch the Hearts of Animal Lovers Everywhere |date=7 July 2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-58063-101-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gco944svzwwC |accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> and ''To Free a Dolphin: A Dramatic Case for Keeping Dolphins in their Natural Environment, by the Trainer of \"Flipper\"''<ref name=\"CoulbournO'Barry2015\">{{cite book |last1=O'Barry |first1=Richard |last2=Coulbourn |first2=Keith |title=To Free a Dolphin: A Dramatic Case for Keeping Dolphins in their Natural Environment, by the Trainer of \"Flipper\" |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-250-09983-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ddfCgAAQBAJ |accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> both focusing on Dolphin preservation.

The commission recognizes three different types of whaling: aboriginal subsistence, commercial, and special permit (or scientific) whaling.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://iwc.int/whaling|title=Whaling|website=iwc.int|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>\n\n===== Aboriginal subsistence whaling =====\nThis form of whaling supports indigenous communities where whale products play an important role in cultural and nutritional life. The IWC sets catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling every six years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwc.int/aboriginal|title=Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling in the Arctic|website=iwc.int|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>\n\n===== Commercial whaling =====\nThis form of whaling is highly regulated by the IWC and is currently on a moratorium. There are a few countries that oppose the moratorium and continue to hunt for whales; these countries share catch data with the Commission but are not regulated by it.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSince the moratorium was put in place in 1986, more than 50,000 whales have been hunted and killed; there are three nations that are still able to hunt whales because of loopholes in the ban. Norway is able to hunt because of an \u201cobjection\u201d to the ban; Iceland is able to hunt because of a \u201creservation\u201d and Japan is able to hunt because they claim it is for \u201cresearch purposes\u201d. If combined these nations kill around 2,000 whales each year; these whales include humpback, minke, sperm, fin, Bryde's, and sei. The IWC ban does allow for some Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling (ASW) in certain countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===== Special permit/scientific whaling =====\nThis category of whaling is separated from IWC-regulated whaling by international law. Special permit research proposals are to be submitted by countries to the IWC for scientific scrutiny. The role of the IWC is advisory only.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Greenpeace ====\n[[Greenpeace]], an international environmental organization founded in 1971 in British Columbia, fights against whaling. Their campaigns are nonviolent and many times involve one or more of the five Greenpeace ships which first made the organization famous in the 1970s. In late December 2005, Japanese whaling fleets experienced heavy opposition from Greenpeace, who protested that the Japanese were continuing their commercial whaling under the guise of research,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3325580.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Australia condemns bloody killing of whale and calf by Japanese fleet | first=Paul | last=Larter | date=February 8, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> and even worse, they were doing so in the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]].

Rather, each country has its own name for the areas.  [[Marine reserve|Marine Reserves]], Specially Protected Areas, Marine Park all relate to this concept, though differ slightly.  Some of the most famous marine protected areas are the [[Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary]] along the coasts of Spain, Monaco, and Italy, and Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef]].  The largest sanctuary in the world is the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument.  The purpose of these sanctuaries is to provide protection for the living and non-living resources of the oceans and seas.  They are created to save species, nursing resources and to help sustain the fish population.\n\nThe activists at the [[Ocean Conservancy]] fight for this cause.  They believe that the United States should put forth a consistent and firm commitment in using marine protected areas as a management strategy.  Currently, the argument in the United States is whether or not they are necessary, when it should be how can they work the most efficiently.<ref>David White, \"Fully Protected Marine Reserves Will Promote Sustainable Fishing\", 2001</ref>  Activists at the Ocean Conservancy have been working on a campaign called the ''Save Our Ocean Legacy,'' a campaign lasting several years trying to establish Marine Protected Areas' off of the California coasts.  29 Marine Protected Areas were planned to be established when the legislation bill passed in 1999.  The hope is that the plan will be finalized in 2007.<ref>Environment California, \"Save Our Ocean Legacy,\"{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentcalifornia.org/ocean-legacy/save-our-ocean-legacy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418122217/http://www.environmentcalifornia.org/ocean-legacy/save-our-ocean-legacy |archivedate=2007-04-18 }}</ref>\n\nSome fishers do not accept that marine protected areas benefit fish stocks and provide insurance against stock collapse. Marine protected areas can cause a short-term loss in fisheries production.<ref>Robert L. Ship, \"No Take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a Fishery Management Tool, a Pragmatic Perspective: A Report to the FishAmerica Foundation\", May 23, 2002</ref>  However, the concept of spillover, where fish within a marine protected area move into fished areas, thus benefiting fisheries, has been misunderstood by some fishers.<ref>Richard B.

Marine conservation is properly conceived as a set of management strategies for the protection and preservation of [[ecosystem]]s in oceans and seas. Activists raise public awareness and support for conservation, while pushing governments and corporations to practice sound ocean management, create conservation policy, and enforce existing laws and policy through effective regulation.  There are many different kinds of organizations and agencies that work toward these common goals. They all are a part of the growing movement that is ocean conservation.  These organizations fight for many causes including stopping [[pollution]], [[overfishing]], [[whaling]] and [[by-catch]]ing, and supporting [[marine protected area]]s.\n\n==History==\n===United States===\nThough the [[environmental movement]] began in the United States during the 1960s, the idea of marine conservation really did not take off in the country until the 1972 [[Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act]] (MPRSA) passed, beginning the movement. The act allowed the regulation by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) over dumping in the seas.  Though the act was later amended, it was one of several key events to bring marine issues towards the front of environmental issues in the United States.\n\n=== Notable people ===\n* [[Jacques Cousteau]]: Explorer, Conservationist, Researcher & Author\n* [[Sylvia Earle]]: Marine Biologist, Explorer, & Author\n* [[Steve Irwin]]: Naturalist, Conservationist, Zoologist, Herpetologist, & Television Personality\n\n==== [[Ric O'Barry]] ====\nO'Barry is an author of the books ''Behind the Dolphin Smile''<ref name=\"O'BarryCoulbourn2000\">{{cite book |last1=O'Barry |first1=Richard |last2=Coulbourn |first2=Keith |title=Behind the Dolphin Smile: A True Story that Will Touch the Hearts of Animal Lovers Everywhere |date=7 July 2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-58063-101-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gco944svzwwC |accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> and ''To Free a Dolphin: A Dramatic Case for Keeping Dolphins in their Natural Environment, by the Trainer of \"Flipper\"''<ref name=\"CoulbournO'Barry2015\">{{cite book |last1=O'Barry |first1=Richard |last2=Coulbourn |first2=Keith |title=To Free a Dolphin: A Dramatic Case for Keeping Dolphins in their Natural Environment, by the Trainer of \"Flipper\" |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=St. Martin's Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-250-09983-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ddfCgAAQBAJ |accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref> both focusing on Dolphin preservation.

The IWC sets catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling every six years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwc.int/aboriginal|title=Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling in the Arctic|website=iwc.int|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>\n\n===== Commercial whaling =====\nThis form of whaling is highly regulated by the IWC and is currently on a moratorium. There are a few countries that oppose the moratorium and continue to hunt for whales; these countries share catch data with the Commission but are not regulated by it.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSince the moratorium was put in place in 1986, more than 50,000 whales have been hunted and killed; there are three nations that are still able to hunt whales because of loopholes in the ban. Norway is able to hunt because of an \u201cobjection\u201d to the ban; Iceland is able to hunt because of a \u201creservation\u201d and Japan is able to hunt because they claim it is for \u201cresearch purposes\u201d. If combined these nations kill around 2,000 whales each year; these whales include humpback, minke, sperm, fin, Bryde's, and sei. The IWC ban does allow for some Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling (ASW) in certain countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===== Special permit/scientific whaling =====\nThis category of whaling is separated from IWC-regulated whaling by international law.

Their campaigns are nonviolent and many times involve one or more of the five Greenpeace ships which first made the organization famous in the 1970s.

These created sanctuaries provide a protected area for the sharks and also promote change in nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharksavers.org/en/home/|title=Shark Savers :: Home|website=www.sharksavers.org|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\n==== Bite-Back ====\n[[Bite-Back]] is another organization that is active in the community and aims to stop the sale of shark fins for the making of shark fin soup in Great Britain. By exposing the UK and their acts toward profiting from shark products, they aim to put an end to their ways of over fishing and exploitation. The organizations main goal is to allow marine life a chance to thrive while they are busy doing the dirty work of lowering consumer stipulation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bite-back.com/about/|title=About - Bite-Back|website=www.bite-back.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==== Shark Trust ====\nPart of a worldwide alliance called The Global Shark and Ray Initiative (GSRI), the Shark Trust is working in efforts to better the ocean for marine animals such as shark and rays. The Initiative created a plan for changing the status of the shark population that would span over 10 years starting on February 15, 2016. Teaming up with other large conservation organization such as Shark Advocates International and [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), the team aims to ultimately give these vulnerable animals the safety and security that the ought to have in their natural environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharktrust.org/en/global_strategy|title=The Shark Trust - Global Strategy|website=www.sharktrust.org|access-date=2016-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220074640/http://www.sharktrust.org/en/global_strategy|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Overfishing ===\n{{main|Overfishing}}\nOverfishing occurs when fish stocks are over-exploited to below acceptable levels; eventually the fish populations will no longer be able to sustain themselves. This can lead to resource depletion, reduced biological growth, and low biomass levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120920-are-we-running-out-of-fish|title=How the world\u2019s oceans could be running out of fish|last=Vince|first=Gaia|access-date=2016-12-07}}</ref> In September 2016, a partnership of Google and [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] and Skytruth introduced [[Global Fishing Watch]], a website designed to assist citizens of the globe in monitoring fishing activities.<ref>[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/global-fishing-watch-google/ Google Launches Global Fishing Watch]\u2014''[[Digital Trends]]'' (September 16, 2016)</ref><ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-sharpless/oceana-unveils-global-fis_b_12030462.html Oceana Unveils Global Fishing Watch]\u2014''[[Huffington Post]]'' (September 15, 2016)</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-16/illegal-fishing-watch-site-crowdsourced-solution-overfishing/7851064 Illegal fishing targeted by crowdsourcing thanks to new Global Fishing Watch website]\u2014[[ABC News (Australia)|''ABC News'' (Australia)]] (September 15, 2016)</ref>\n\n==Marine protected areas==\n{{main|Marine protected area}}\n\nAlthough the idea of marine protected areas is an internationally known concept, there is no one term used internationally.  Rather, each country has its own name for the areas.  [[Marine reserve|Marine Reserves]], Specially Protected Areas, Marine Park all relate to this concept, though differ slightly.  Some of the most famous marine protected areas are the [[Ligurian Sea Cetacean Sanctuary]] along the coasts of Spain, Monaco, and Italy, and Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef]].  The largest sanctuary in the world is the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument.  The purpose of these sanctuaries is to provide protection for the living and non-living resources of the oceans and seas.  They are created to save species, nursing resources and to help sustain the fish population.\n\nThe activists at the [[Ocean Conservancy]] fight for this cause.  They believe that the United States should put forth a consistent and firm commitment in using marine protected areas as a management strategy.  Currently, the argument in the United States is whether or not they are necessary, when it should be how can they work the most efficiently.<ref>David White, \"Fully Protected Marine Reserves Will Promote Sustainable Fishing\", 2001</ref>  Activists at the Ocean Conservancy have been working on a campaign called the ''Save Our Ocean Legacy,'' a campaign lasting several years trying to establish Marine Protected Areas' off of the California coasts.  29 Marine Protected Areas were planned to be established when the legislation bill passed in 1999.  The hope is that the plan will be finalized in 2007.<ref>Environment California, \"Save Our Ocean Legacy,\"{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentcalifornia.org/ocean-legacy/save-our-ocean-legacy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418122217/http://www.environmentcalifornia.org/ocean-legacy/save-our-ocean-legacy |archivedate=2007-04-18 }}</ref>\n\nSome fishers do not accept that marine protected areas benefit fish stocks and provide insurance against stock collapse. Marine protected areas can cause a short-term loss in fisheries production.<ref>Robert L. Ship, \"No Take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a Fishery Management Tool, a Pragmatic Perspective: A Report to the FishAmerica Foundation\", May 23, 2002</ref>  However, the concept of spillover, where fish within a marine protected area move into fished areas, thus benefiting fisheries, has been misunderstood by some fishers.<ref>Richard B. Allen, \"No-Take Reserves as a Fishery Management Tool\", speech delivered at Fisheries, Oceanography, and Society: A Symposium Presented by the Ocean Life Institute, August 27, 2001</ref> The term is a simplification of numerous ecological benefits that are derived from removing fishing from nursery, breeding grounds and essential fish habitats.<ref>For example see N.A.J.

In 1960, the state legislature provided for junior college districts in Arizona. The Maricopa County Junior College District was established in 1962 by the approval of county voters, with the new system acquiring Phoenix Junior College.\n\nThe system established branch campuses of Phoenix Junior College in the nearby suburbs of Glendale and Mesa; these would become independent campuses within the system by the end of the decade (1965). Other campuses were established in the following years:\n\n* Southwest Skill Center (now part of [[GateWay Community College]]) in 2000;\n* Maricopa Technical College (now [[GateWay Community College]]) in 1968;\n* [[Scottsdale Community College]] in 1969;\n* [[Rio Salado Community College]] in 1978;\n* [[South Mountain Community College]] in 1980;\n* the Northeast Valley Education Center (now [[Paradise Valley Community College]]) in 1985;\n* the Chandler/Gilbert Education Center (now [[Chandler-Gilbert Community College]]) in 1985;\n* [[Estrella Mountain Community College]] in 1990;\n* the Red Mountain campus part of [[Mesa Community College]] in 2001;\n* Glendale Community College North in 2008;\n* Paradise Valley Community College at Black Mountain in 2009.\n\nIn 1971, the \"Junior College\" portion of the name was changed to \"Community College\".\n\nThe State Board of Directors for Community Colleges of Arizona presided over the entire statewide community college system until June 2002, when the Arizona Legislature reduced its powers and duties and transferred most oversight to individual community college districts.\n\nIn 2010, the various nursing programs at each of the Maricopa Community Colleges coalesced under one standard curriculum and program consortium: \"MaricopaNursing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maricopa.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/hce/Student_Handbook.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nursing Student Handbook 2018-2019|website=Maricoa.edu|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn January 8, 2013 MCCCD migrates students and faculty from a [[Blackboard Inc.]] solution to the [[Instructure]] Canvas [[learning management system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/phxcollege/posts/dear-maricopa-students-goodbye-blackboard-hello-canvas-effective-summer-2013-all/490048647713674/|title=Phoenix College|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> Rio Salado college continues to use its custom implementation of [[Microsoft Sharepoint]], RioLearn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2007/08/2007-Campus-Technology-Innovators-Portals.aspx|title=2007 Campus Technology Innovators: Portals -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, the Maricopa Skill Center which has three campuses including Buckeye & 12th St, 29th Ave & Bell, and 75th Ave & Peoria are folded into the Gateway Community College brand.

In 1960, the state legislature provided for junior college districts in Arizona. The Maricopa County Junior College District was established in 1962 by the approval of county voters, with the new system acquiring Phoenix Junior College.\n\nThe system established branch campuses of Phoenix Junior College in the nearby suburbs of Glendale and Mesa; these would become independent campuses within the system by the end of the decade (1965). Other campuses were established in the following years:\n\n* Southwest Skill Center (now part of [[GateWay Community College]]) in 2000;\n* Maricopa Technical College (now [[GateWay Community College]]) in 1968;\n* [[Scottsdale Community College]] in 1969;\n* [[Rio Salado Community College]] in 1978;\n* [[South Mountain Community College]] in 1980;\n* the Northeast Valley Education Center (now [[Paradise Valley Community College]]) in 1985;\n* the Chandler/Gilbert Education Center (now [[Chandler-Gilbert Community College]]) in 1985;\n* [[Estrella Mountain Community College]] in 1990;\n* the Red Mountain campus part of [[Mesa Community College]] in 2001;\n* Glendale Community College North in 2008;\n* Paradise Valley Community College at Black Mountain in 2009.\n\nIn 1971, the \"Junior College\" portion of the name was changed to \"Community College\".\n\nThe State Board of Directors for Community Colleges of Arizona presided over the entire statewide community college system until June 2002, when the Arizona Legislature reduced its powers and duties and transferred most oversight to individual community college districts.\n\nIn 2010, the various nursing programs at each of the Maricopa Community Colleges coalesced under one standard curriculum and program consortium: \"MaricopaNursing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maricopa.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/hce/Student_Handbook.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nursing Student Handbook 2018-2019|website=Maricoa.edu|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn January 8, 2013 MCCCD migrates students and faculty from a [[Blackboard Inc.]] solution to the [[Instructure]] Canvas [[learning management system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/phxcollege/posts/dear-maricopa-students-goodbye-blackboard-hello-canvas-effective-summer-2013-all/490048647713674/|title=Phoenix College|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> Rio Salado college continues to use its custom implementation of [[Microsoft Sharepoint]], RioLearn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://campustechnology.com/Articles/2007/08/2007-Campus-Technology-Innovators-Portals.aspx|title=2007 Campus Technology Innovators: Portals -- Campus Technology|website=Campus Technology|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2016, the Maricopa Skill Center which has three campuses including Buckeye & 12th St, 29th Ave & Bell, and 75th Ave & Peoria are folded into the Gateway Community College brand.

The group formed in 1990 in the city of [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] and released their first album in 1992. Their name is derived from the [[Babylonia]]n god [[Marduk]], [[patron deity]] of [[Babylon]].\n\n==History==\nMarduk was formed by Morgan Steinmeyer H\u00e5kansson in order to form the \"most blasphemous band in the world\".<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_marduk\n| last=Maki|first=Jeff\n| quote=''Guitarist Morgan H\u00e5kansson formed Marduk in 1990 with the vision to create the most satanic and blasphemous band, not only from the hallowed metal grounds of Sweden, but anywhere on the globe. In fact, he has said that death and violence are most inspirational to Marduk, with a particular focus on the violence in the Bible for lyrics''\n| title= Marduk \u2013 The fifteen year plague\n| publisher=live-metal.net\n| accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>  Their musical style was that of a straightforward [[death metal]] influenced take on [[black metal]] music, but as the years progressed their style and imagery became more of a fast and intense form of black metal.<ref name=\"York\">York, William \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p276123/biography|pure_url=yes}} Marduk Biography]\", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref>  \n\nMarduk's predominant lyrical topics are [[Satanism]], [[anti-Christianity]], [[blasphemy]], [[death]], [[Third Reich]] history, and [[World War II]]. The latter two are a later addition to their lyrical/conceptual themes, stemming from their 1999 release ''Panzer Division Marduk''. Marduk have recorded further songs relating to those chapters of human history, such as \"The Hangman of Prague\" (moniker of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] - second in command of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] - in his capacity as the ''de facto'' [[Reichsprotektor]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|of Bohemia and Moravia]]), \"Night of the Long Knives\", \"Deathmarch\" and others. On the Nightwing album the band samples a march by the fascist and [[anti-semitic]] [[Iron Guard]] in [[Romania]].<ref>Album: Nightwing. Sample: final song, outro</ref> The band's fixation on Nazi-era Germany has caused a great deal of controversy, leading to multiple performances being cancelled, and leaving the band unable to tour multiple countries in various parts of the world. Much of this controversy stems from a 1995 interview with Nordic Vision Magazine, in which guitarist Morgan Steinmeyer H\u00e5kansson was quoted as saying \"in Germany, where magazines as \u201cRock Hard\u201d and \u201cMetal Hammer\u201d have decided that we are a facistic [sic] band and refuse to print any ads with Marduk [\u2026] the reason for this is that in a German magazine I said that we in Marduk want to prevent immigration to Sweden and that I was proud over the fact that my grandfather was a serving German officer during the second World War\u201d and that \u201cimmigrants \u2013 who poison our environment\u201d should not be allowed into Sweden.{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide a link|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn September 2016, The band was supposed to tour the U.S with [[Carach Angren]], [[Rotting Christ]], and [[Necronomicon (band)|Necronomicon]] but was forced to drop out, leaving the other three to continue on, due to unresolved delays in obtaining visas.<ref>{{cite web \n| url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/marduk-drops-off-us-tour-with-rotting-christ-and-carach-angren \n| title= MARDUK Drops Off Its US Tour With ROTTING CHRIST And CARACH ANGREN\n| publisher= metalinjection.net}}</ref> Due to that, the band was forced to postpone the tour to early 2017. In late February their planned Oakland show was cancelled by the venue for fears of security issues after a local [[anti-fascist]] group targeted the band and reportedly threatened the venue staff.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://teamrock.com/news/2017-02-20/marduks-oakland-show-cancelled-due-to-security-concerns\n| title= Marduk\u2019s Oakland show cancelled due to security concerns\n| publisher=teamrock.com\n| quote=''Loudwire report that the band were last week targeted by the Anti-Fascist Action Bay Area, who, in a Facebook post that has now been taken down, called them a \u201cblack metal band with known white supremacist ties from Sweden that profits off of glorifying Nazi imagery and songs about Nazi SS officers and anti-semitism.\u201d But after researching Marduk, the venue found no indications that they were \u201cwhite supremacists, nationalists, or anti-immigrant\u201d and wanted the gig to go ahead. However, after staff were reportedly threatened, and in consultation with police, it was decided the show would be scrapped.''\n| date=2017-02-20\n| accessdate=2017-02-21}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2018 vocalist Mortuus and drummer Fredrik Widigs were accused of purchasing items from the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]] (NMR), a Swedish [[neo-Nazi]] organization, after sale records for various purchases were uncovered, including Mortuus and Widigs' real names, personal email addresses, and shipment records confirmed the material was shipped to the members' home addresses.

The group formed in 1990 in the city of [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] and released their first album in 1992. Their name is derived from the [[Babylonia]]n god [[Marduk]], [[patron deity]] of [[Babylon]].\n\n==History==\nMarduk was formed by Morgan Steinmeyer H\u00e5kansson in order to form the \"most blasphemous band in the world\".<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_marduk\n| last=Maki|first=Jeff\n| quote=''Guitarist Morgan H\u00e5kansson formed Marduk in 1990 with the vision to create the most satanic and blasphemous band, not only from the hallowed metal grounds of Sweden, but anywhere on the globe. In fact, he has said that death and violence are most inspirational to Marduk, with a particular focus on the violence in the Bible for lyrics''\n| title= Marduk \u2013 The fifteen year plague\n| publisher=live-metal.net\n| accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>  Their musical style was that of a straightforward [[death metal]] influenced take on [[black metal]] music, but as the years progressed their style and imagery became more of a fast and intense form of black metal.<ref name=\"York\">York, William \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p276123/biography|pure_url=yes}} Marduk Biography]\", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation</ref>  \n\nMarduk's predominant lyrical topics are [[Satanism]], [[anti-Christianity]], [[blasphemy]], [[death]], [[Third Reich]] history, and [[World War II]]. The latter two are a later addition to their lyrical/conceptual themes, stemming from their 1999 release ''Panzer Division Marduk''. Marduk have recorded further songs relating to those chapters of human history, such as \"The Hangman of Prague\" (moniker of [[Reinhard Heydrich]] - second in command of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] - in his capacity as the ''de facto'' [[Reichsprotektor]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|of Bohemia and Moravia]]), \"Night of the Long Knives\", \"Deathmarch\" and others. On the Nightwing album the band samples a march by the fascist and [[anti-semitic]] [[Iron Guard]] in [[Romania]].<ref>Album: Nightwing. Sample: final song, outro</ref> The band's fixation on Nazi-era Germany has caused a great deal of controversy, leading to multiple performances being cancelled, and leaving the band unable to tour multiple countries in various parts of the world. Much of this controversy stems from a 1995 interview with Nordic Vision Magazine, in which guitarist Morgan Steinmeyer H\u00e5kansson was quoted as saying \"in Germany, where magazines as \u201cRock Hard\u201d and \u201cMetal Hammer\u201d have decided that we are a facistic [sic] band and refuse to print any ads with Marduk [\u2026] the reason for this is that in a German magazine I said that we in Marduk want to prevent immigration to Sweden and that I was proud over the fact that my grandfather was a serving German officer during the second World War\u201d and that \u201cimmigrants \u2013 who poison our environment\u201d should not be allowed into Sweden.{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide a link|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn September 2016, The band was supposed to tour the U.S with [[Carach Angren]], [[Rotting Christ]], and [[Necronomicon (band)|Necronomicon]] but was forced to drop out, leaving the other three to continue on, due to unresolved delays in obtaining visas<ref>{{cite web \n| url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/marduk-drops-off-us-tour-with-rotting-christ-and-carach-angren \n| title= MARDUK Drops Off Its US Tour With ROTTING CHRIST And CARACH ANGREN\n| publisher= metalinjection.net}}</ref>. Due to that, the band was forced to postpone the tour to early 2017. In late February their planned Oakland show was cancelled by the venue for fears of security issues after a local [[anti-fascist]] group targeted the band and reportedly threatened the venue staff.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://teamrock.com/news/2017-02-20/marduks-oakland-show-cancelled-due-to-security-concerns\n| title= Marduk\u2019s Oakland show cancelled due to security concerns\n| publisher=teamrock.com\n| quote=''Loudwire report that the band were last week targeted by the Anti-Fascist Action Bay Area, who, in a Facebook post that has now been taken down, called them a \u201cblack metal band with known white supremacist ties from Sweden that profits off of glorifying Nazi imagery and songs about Nazi SS officers and anti-semitism.\u201d But after researching Marduk, the venue found no indications that they were \u201cwhite supremacists, nationalists, or anti-immigrant\u201d and wanted the gig to go ahead. However, after staff were reportedly threatened, and in consultation with police, it was decided the show would be scrapped.''\n| date=2017-02-20\n| accessdate=2017-02-21}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2018 vocalist Mortuus and drummer Fredrik Widigs were accused of purchasing items from the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]] (NMR), a Swedish [[neo-Nazi]] organization, after sale records for various purchases were uncovered, including Mortuus and Widigs' real names, personal email addresses, and shipment records confirmed the material was shipped to the members' home addresses. The items included stickers and flyers promoting the NMR and the books \"Our Way - The Nordic Party Movement Party Program\" and \"National Socialism - The Biological Worldview\". <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.etc.se/nyheter/black-metal-band-avslojade-med-nmr-kopplingar|title=Black metal-band avsl\u00f6jade med NMR-kopplingar|last=S\u00f6derin|first=Eigil|date=2018-04-04|work=ETC|access-date=2018-04-04|language=sv}}</ref> Marduk denied these claims on their official Facebook page stating, \"No Marduk member has ordered anything from the website in question, or ever had any form of interaction with the organisation operating it.
