Browder was the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Browder served time in federal prison as a [[conscientious objector]] to [[conscription]] and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the [[Communist International]] and its [[Red International of Labor Unions]] in [[China]] and the Pacific region.\n\nIn 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for [[President of the United States]]. Browder also took part in activities on behalf of [[Soviet espionage in the United States|Soviet intelligence in America]] during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn the wake of public outrage over the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939 Nazi\u2013Soviet pact]], Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity.\n\nBrowder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized [[pressure group]] within a broad governing coalition, in 1944 he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a \"Communist Political Association.\" However, following the death of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a [[Cold War]] and [[Second Red Scare|internal red scare]] quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, due largely to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands.\n\nBrowder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in [[Yonkers, New York]] and later in Princeton, New Jersey, where he died. He wrote numerous books and pamphlets on political issues.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nEarl Browder was born on May 20, 1891 in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the eighth child of Martha Jane (Hankins) and William Browder, a teacher and farmer.<ref>[https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/b/browder_e.htm]</ref> His father was sympathetic to [[populism]].<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\">Theodore Draper'', The Roots of American Communism'', pg. 308</ref> He joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] in Wichita in 1907 at the age of 16 and remained in that organization until the party split of 1912, when many of the group's members who supported the [[syndicalist]] ideal exited the party after it added an anti-[[sabotage]] clause to the party constitution and the recall of National Executive Committeeman [[William \"Big Bill\" Haywood]].<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\" /> Historian Theodore Draper notes that Browder \"was influenced by an offshoot of the syndicalist movement which believed in working in the AF of L ([[American Federation of Labor]]).\"<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\" /> This ideological orientation brought the young Browder into contact with [[William Z. Foster]], founder of an organization called the [[Syndicalist League of North America]] which was based upon similar policies and [[James P. Cannon]], an IWW adherent from Kansas.\n\nBrowder moved to Kansas City and was employed as an office worker, entering the AFofL union of his trade, the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants union.<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\" /> In 1916 he took a job as manager of the Johnson County Cooperative Association in [[Olathe, Kansas]].\n\n[[File:Browder-earl-prison1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prison photo of Earl Browder, December 1917.]]\n\nBrowder was aggressively opposed to [[World War I]] and publicly spoke out against it, characterizing the fighting as an [[imperialist]] conflict. After the United States joined the war in 1917, Browder was arrested and charged under the [[Espionage Act]] conspiring to defeat the operation of the draft law and nonregistration.<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\">Theodore Draper'', The Roots of American Communism'', pg. 309</ref> Browder was sentenced to two years in prison for conspiracy and a year for nonregistration,<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\" /> sitting in jail from December 1917 to November 1918.\n\nIn 1919, Browder, Cannon and their Kansas City associates started a radical newspaper, ''The Workers World'', with Browder serving as the first editor. In June of that year Browder was jailed again on a conspiracy charge, however, with Cannon taking over as editor.<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\" /> Browder's second prison stint, served at [[Leavenworth Penitentiary]], lasted until November 1920, putting him out of circulation during the critical interval when the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party]] quit the SPA to form the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of America]] and the [[Communist Labor Party of America]].<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\" /> A series of splits and mergers followed, with the two Communist parties formally merging in 1921.\n\nReleased from prison at last, Browder lost no time in joining the [[United Communist Party]] (UCP), as well as the fledgling [[Trade Union Educational League]] (TUEL) being launched by his old associate William Z. Foster. Browder found employment as the managing editor of the monthly magazine of TUEL, ''The Labor Herald''.\n\nIn 1920 the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) headed by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] decided to establish an international confederation of Communist trade unions, the [[Profintern|Red International of Labor Unions]] (RILU, or \"Profintern\"). A founding convention was planned to be held in Moscow in July 1921 and an American delegation was gathered, including members of the American Communist Parties and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. Earl Browder was named to this delegation, ostensibly representing Kansas miners, with the non-party man Foster attending as a journalist representing the [[Federated Press]].<ref>Theodore Draper'', The Roots of American Communism'', pg. 316</ref> This trip to Soviet Russia incidentally proved decisive in bringing the syndicalist Foster over to the Communist movement.\n\nThroughout the early 1920s, Browder and Foster worked together closely in the TUEL, trying to win over the support of the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]] in the establishment of a new mass [[Farmer-Labor Party]] that would be able to challenge the electoral hegemony of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties.\n\nIn 1928, the estranged Browder and his girlfriend [[Kitty Harris]] went to [[China]] and lived in [[Shanghai]] where Browder served as Secretary of the RILU's [[Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat]], a clandestine labor organization working to unify the labor movement of Asia and the nations of the [[Pacific basin]].  The pair returned to the United States in January 1929.<ref name=Ryan37>James G. Ryan, ''Earl Browder: The Failure of American Communism''. Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 1997; pg. 37.</ref>\n\n=== The fall of Lovestone ===\n[[File:Lovestone-jay-1917.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Jay Lovestone in 1917. Lovestone was Executive Secretary of the CPUSA from the death of [[C.E. Ruthenberg]] in early 1927 to the middle of 1929.]]\n\nThe year 1929 marked a major turn in the Communist Party of the United States of America. Party leader [[Jay Lovestone]], having won a massive factional victory over the Chicago-based rival group headed by [[William Z. Foster]] at the 6th National Convention of the organization, ran afoul of the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) and the [[Third Period|ultra-radical program]] which the member organizations of the Comintern were instructed to pursue. Lovestone headed a 10-member delegation to [[Moscow]] to appeal his case to the American Commission of ECCI; things did not go well for him and in the squabble over autonomy Lovestone attempted a factional coup involving the seizure of party assets.\n\nOn May 17, 1929, ECCI ordered the removal of Lovestone.<ref name=Ryan37 /> He was replaced on a provisional basis by a five-person secretariat which included former Lovestone associate [[Max Bedacht]] as \"Acting Secretary\" and well as opposition factional leader and trade union chief Bill Foster; two relatively independent figures in the persons of cartoonist-turned-functionary [[Robert Minor]] and former Executive Secretary of the underground party [[Will Weinstone]]; and Comintern Representative [[Boris Mikhailov (Comintern)|Boris Mikhailov]] ([[pseudonym]] \"G. Williams\") as the unpublicized power behind the throne.<ref name=Ryan37 />\n\nWhile the center of gravity in the leadership of the CPUSA was rapidly shifted, Browder remained largely outside of the ongoing machinations of power, continuing to function as an employee of the Comintern. In August 1929 Browder was dispatched to [[Vladivostok]], located in the far eastern reaches of Soviet [[Siberia]] on the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] coastline, to attend the final formal gathering of RILU's [[Pan Pacific Trade Union Secretariat]].<ref name=Ryan37 />\n\nBrowder returned to the United States again in October 1929, just in time for a critical plenary session of the Central Committee of the American party.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Allies in the Comintern had already begun to promote the trusted Browder as the best figure to head the American Communist Party, with [[Solomon Lozovsky]] taking up his banner in Moscow while Mikhailov-Williams lent his support from America.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Foster's credibility had been badly tarnished in Moscow as a result of his role as a leader of the frequently unprincipled factional war which had paralyzed the American party throughout the decade of the 1920s.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Placing Browder \u2014 the man responsible for bringing Foster into the Communist movement \u2014 in authority was seen as a means for shifting power decisively away from the former Lovestone group without opening a new round of factional warfare which would have inevitably resulted had the mantle been given directly to Foster.\n\nBrowder deferred from the position of party Secretary, however, not feeling himself sufficiently acclimated to the political situation in the CPUSA.<ref name=Ryan37 /> The October plenum therefore returned Bedacht and Minor to a collective leadership, dropping Foster and Weinstone.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Weinstone was named as the new American Representative to the Comintern,<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 37\u201338.</ref> replacing the recently expelled righthand man of Jay Lovestone, [[Bertram D. Wolfe]], in the position. Browder was added to this new three member Secretariat, named head of the party's Agitation and Propaganda department.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 38.</ref>\n\n=== Rise to party leadership ===\n[[File:Weinstone-will-1927.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Will Weinstone as he appeared in 1927. Weinstone was one of the main contenders for leadership of the CPUSA in the years after the fall of Jay Lovestone in 1929.]]\n\nThe 4th quarter of 1929 saw the wheels fall off the wagon, marked by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|October 24 Wall Street Crash]] and the beginning of a massive economic contraction remembered to history as the [[Great Depression]]. As head of the CPUSA's Agitprop, Browder was responsible for generating party literature intended to transform the [[unemployment]] crisis into a mass movement for revolutionary change.<ref name=Ryan40>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 40.</ref> Browder was instrumental in planning American activities relating to [[International Unemployment Day]], March 6, 1930 \u2014 an international day of mass protest, set in motion by the Comintern, against unemployment.<ref name=Ryan40 /> A network of [[Unemployed Councils]] were established under Communist Party auspices.<ref name=Ryan41>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 41.</ref>\n\nAnother change of the top level leadership of the CPUSA took place at the party's 7th National Convention of June 21\u201325, 1930.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 45\u201346.</ref> Max Bedacht, formerly a top figure in the hierarchy of the Lovestone faction who had only recanted his views at the 11th hour in front of the American Commission of ECCI in Moscow was removed as Secretary and moved to a less sensitive leadership role as head of the [[International Workers Order]]. A new three person Secretariat was appointed, with Browder as Secretary of the political department while Will Weinstone and Bill Foster heading the organizational and trade union departments, respectively.<ref name=Ryan46>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 46.</ref> With Weinstone in Moscow as the CPUSA's Comintern Rep and Foster in jail for his connection with the March 6 International Unemployment Day demonstration, which had ended in street fighting in New York City, Browder's position as chief decision-maker of the party was at least temporarily bolstered.<ref name=Ryan46 />\n\nBrowder's status as the de facto first among equals among members of the Secretariat of the American CP was further emphasized at the [[11th Plenum of the Comintern]], held from March 26 to April 11, 1931. There it was Browder who delivered the main report of the CPUSA, indicative of his prime position in the organization.<ref>Harvey Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade''. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 25.</ref>\n\nTension developed between the trio, with Foster seeing his long-desired place as CPUSA chief foiled by a man who had formerly been his lieutenant at the Trade Union Educational League; both the midwesterners distrusted the ambitious, college-educated New Yorker Weinstone.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 47.</ref> Browder's considerable administrative skills, his ability to intelligently defend his ideas, and his willingness to yield to others when necessary scored points for his personal cause in Moscow.<ref name=Ryan49>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 49.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1932 Browder's primary leadership role was consolidated.<ref name=Ryan49 /> When Weinstone returned from Moscow anxious to once again pursue party leadership positions, protracted squabbling over party policy threatened to erupt into a 1920s-style factional war.<ref name=Ryan52>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 52.</ref> In August the Comintern Representative, sensing such a danger, advised Moscow of \"some strong person\" to stop the \"squabbling.\"<ref>Quoted in Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 53.</ref> The third member of the Secretariat, William Z. Foster, the party's candidate for President, suffered an attack of [[angina pectoris]] and was ordered by doctors to cease campaigning and to undergo bed rest \u2014 with visitation and dictation similarly proscribed.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 53.</ref> With Foster out of the picture and a big majority of the party leadership backing him over Weinstone, Browder appealed to the Comintern to resolve what he called \"impossible relations\" with Weinstone by assigning one of them for Comintern work abroad.<ref name=Ryan54>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 54.</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 1932, after extensive debate, the Comintern ruled in Browder's favor, determining that Weinstone would be removed from America to once again serve in Moscow as the CPUSA's official representative there.<ref name=Ryan54 /> Moscow's vision seems to have been for a joint party leadership between Browder and Foster.<ref name=Ryan55>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 55.</ref> The unexpected factor proved to be the chronic and incapacitating nature of Foster's heart ailment, which left Browder in a position of effective unitary leadership.\n\nAlthough Weinstone had been removed from America to break up an incipient factional war, he continued to campaign for the position of party leader. In the spring of 1933 he obtained the final test of strength he had been looking for, in the form of a dozen meetings of the Comintern's Anglo-American Secretariat in Moscow spread out over 29 days.<ref name=Ryan58>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 58.</ref> Throughout April Browder and Weinstone leveled charges and counter-charges against one another, examining the Communist Party's activities in the United States in fine detail.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Despite significant criticism of certain of his actions, Browder emerged from the Moscow sessions in a firm position of authority. Weinstone, accepting defeat at last, remained in Moscow as the CPUSA's CI Rep until 1934.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 59.</ref>\n\n=== Leader of the Popular Front ===\n[[File:37-howard-this4thofjuly.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Cover of a patriotic \"penny pamphlet\" of the Communist Party USA from the \"Communism is 20th Century Americanism\" campaign of the late 1930s.]]\n\nWhile Earl Browder was one of the top leaders of American Communism during the so-called Third Period of the early 1930s, he came into his own during the interval which followed, the era of the [[Popular front|Popular Front]] against [[fascism]]. With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] to Chancellor of [[Germany]] at the end of January 1933, the balance of power in Europe was shifted. Formerly home to one of the most powerful Communist organizations, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was quickly suppressed. The failure of the KPD to cooperate with workers adhering to the rival [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was seen by many Comintern officials as a major contributing factor to the disaster. New tactics building a broad alliance in opposition to fascism seemed to be indicated.\n\nBrowder was an enthusiastic supporter of this new [[party line (politics)|party line]]. By the middle of 1934 the Browder-led Central Committee of the CPUSA was pushing the leaders of its youth section, the [[Young Communist League USA|Young Communist League]], to establish a working alliance with the youth section of the rival Socialist Party, the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]].<ref name=Ryan76>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 76.</ref> In the same vein, Browder himself picked up hints from Socialist Party leader [[Norman Thomas]] that joint work between Socialists and Communists might be possible on specific issues, in reply to which Browder issued a letter formally proposing a large scale united front of the two organizations.<ref name=Ryan76 />\n\nStill imagining President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as a fascist dictator in the making, Browder and the Communists began to examine their political isolation from the American working class and to envision the establishment of a new labor party which would include both Communists and Socialists within its ranks.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 77\u201378.</ref> In December 1934 Browder won Comintern approval for his scheme, arguing his case in person in Moscow.<ref name=Ryan78>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 78.</ref> Browder returned to the United States at the end of the month, revealing his plan to a surprised party membership in a public speech delivered on January 6, 1935.<ref name=Ryan78 /> The Socialist Party, for its part, remained skeptical, having been on the receiving end of more than a decade's worth of vilification and violence.\n\nIn conjunction with its newly found interest in building bridges with non-Communist progressives, the CPUSA launched potent new [[mass organization]]s such as the [[American League Against War and Fascism]] (September 1933), the [[American Youth Congress]] (1935), and the [[League of American Writers]] (April 1935). Moreover, as the 1930s progressed and the [[New Deal]] policies of the Roosevelt administration became established, the Browder-led Communist Party moved from a position of bitter opposition to critical support.\n\nAfter 1935 the Communist Party maintained only nominal opposition to the Roosevelt administration, with Browder heading the party's 1936 ticket as its candidate for President in the [[1936 U.S. presidential election|election of 1936]]. He received 80,195 votes.\n\nIn practice, progressives of both parties were seen as key constituents in a broad \"People's Front\" against fascism and a bulwark of the movement for [[collective security]] in Europe against German aggression. The Communist Party attenuated its message of the historical inevitability of revolution, emphasizing progressive trends in American history and attempting to cast itself as an indigenous reform movement under the slogan \"Communism is 20th Century Americanism.\"<ref name=Isserman9>Maurice Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On? The American Communist Party During the Second World War''. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1982; pg. 9.</ref> The stark phraseology of [[Marxism]], based upon the inevitability of [[class struggle]], was replaced by a fuzzy critique of capitalism using Rooseveltian terms like \"economic royalism.\"<ref name=Isserman9 />\n\nEarl Browder was not only the leading party decision-maker but also the public face of this effort. He was, one historian later noted, a man who \"paid lip service to 'proletarian internationalism'\" and who \"knew better than to oppose Soviet-imposed policies, however inappropriate they might be for American conditions,\" but who \"wanted to be a leader of a national movement with power and influence of its own.\"<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe \"Communism is 20th Century Americanism\" campaign, during which Communism was portrayed as an integral part of the American democratic tradition, was successful in building the size and scope of the party organization. But with this growth came a correlated expansion of Browder's personal ego.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 14.</ref> A [[cult of personality]] began to be nurtured among the party faithful in miniature reflection of the systemic adulation of Joseph Stalin in the USSR. In the words of [[Maurice Isserman]]:\n\n<blockquote>The constant praise of his colleagues and the party press, and the adulation in which the membership held him (among his papers Browder saved a letter from a Seattle Communist addressed to the 'Greatest of Living Americans, Earl Browder'), transformed the once unassuming ''apparatchik'' of the 1920s into an arrogant and uncompromising party dictator.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 14\u201315.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBrowder's chief rival in the Communist Party leadership in this interval was William Z. Foster. When a new recession struck in 1937, stifling tax revenue, President Roosevelt and Congress responded by cutting funding for its signature [[Works Progress Administration]] by 50 percent in an attempt to help bring the budget into balance.<ref name=Ryan129>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 129.</ref> Foster sought for the CPUSA to renew a militant stance against capitalism and the government in response to the economic downturn.<ref name=Ryan129 />\n\nBrowder, on the other hand, pushed the party towards moderate criticism of the administration, urging increased expenditures on public works and unemployment relief and lauding Roosevelt's move away from [[isolationism]] in foreign policy in the wake of the rising tide of fascism in Europe.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> A short-lived revival of the Farmer-Labor Party idea was scrapped under Browder's direction, and the New Deal coalition endorsed as the practical base upon which a People's Front could be constructed.<ref name=Ryan129 /> Over question of Foster's militance versus Browder's accommodation with New Deal realities, the Comintern ruled decisively in favor of Browder.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nBrowder made his final trip to the USSR in October 1938, where he made arrangements with Comintern chief [[Georgi Dimitrov]] to establish [[shortwave radio]] communications in the event that international conflict made direct communication impossible.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 46.</ref> No communications of this sort were made until late in September 1939, when the CPUSA's political line on the dramatically changed European situation would be specified.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\n=== Effects of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ===\n[[File:MolotovRibbentropStalin.jpg|thumb|right|240px|With German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and Soviet Communist Party leader Joseph Stalin looking on, [[V. M. Molotov]] signs the non-aggression treaty on behalf of the Soviet Union, August 23, 1939.]]\n\nEuropean geopolitics were fundamentally altered on August 23, 1939, when Foreign Ministers of the USSR and Nazi Germany formally signed a mutual [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression treaty]] known to history as the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. The agreement included secret protocols providing for the Nazi [[Invasion of Poland|invasion and division of Poland]]. Germany's September 1 invasion of [[Poland]] brought an immediate response from its treaty partners [[France]] and [[Great Britain]], who declared war on Germany on September 3.

New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1991; pg. 197.</ref> The Soviet government went further, however, by signing a joint statement with the Germans characterizing the partition of Poland as a ''fait accompli'', calling for an end to hostilities, and placing the onus for any escalation of the European conflict on the governments of Great Britain and France.<ref name=Ottanelli197 />\n\nVirtually overnight the political lines of the Communist parties of the world shifted. Those who were formerly the greatest cheerleaders for collective security against the danger of Germany now became staunch opponents of American intervention in the European military situation\u2014reflective of the newly revised needs of Soviet foreign policy. All anti-fascist propaganda was immediately terminated, overt criticism of German action was minimized, the culpability of the governments of France and Britain was exaggerated.<ref name=Ottanelli197 /> Browder's CPUSA claimed that Hitler's foes intended to escalate the ongoing European conflict into a counterrevolutionary offensive against the USSR.<ref name=Ottanelli197 />\n\nThe result of the sudden shift of the party line caused shock and confusion among many members of the Communist Party USA, a goodly number of whom had joined during the period of the Popular Front against fascism.<ref name=Ottanelli198>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States'', pg. 198.</ref> Browder declared at one Philadelphia rally that only \"a dozen or so\" had left the CPUSA over the change of line; but the party's ranks fell by 15% between 1939 and 1940, and recruitment of new members in 1940 fell by 75% from 1938 levels.<ref name=Ottanelli198 /> The public image of the USSR as a main bulwark against fascism and claims of the CPUSA as an indigenous radical organization were severely undermined.<ref>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States''. pp. 198\u2013199.</ref>\n\nMoreover, the CPUSA's new propaganda offensive against United States participation in the so-called \"Imperialist War\" brought it into political conflict with the Roosevelt administration, which had begun to question the wisdom of isolationism. In the summer of 1939, Texas Congressman [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] (D), chairman of the [[House Special Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC), learned that the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] had begun to investigate old charges that Earl Browder had traveled abroad under assumed names, making use of false documents, during the 1920s.<ref name=Isserman48>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 48.</ref> Dies proceeded to subpoena Browder to appear before the committee to give testimony on the matter.<ref name=Isserman48 /> On September 5, 1939, days after the German invasion of Poland, Browder appeared before HUAC, providing exhaustive testimony over the course of two days.<ref>See: House Special Committee on Un-American Activities, [https://archive.org/details/investigationofu194007unit ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Hearings Before a Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Seventy-Sixth Congress, First Session...: Volume 7, September 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, 1939, at Washington, DC''.] Washington, DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1940; pp. 4275\u20134520.</ref>\n\nMidway through the first day of testimony, Browder was asked in passing whether he had ever traveled abroad under a false passport. Before party attorney [[Joseph Brodsky (attorney)|Joseph Brodsky]] could stop him, Browder answered, \"I have.\"<ref name=Isserman48 /> Although he subsequently refused to answer follow-up questions about the matter, citing the protection against self-incrimination offered by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the damage caused by Browder's admission under oath had been done.<ref name=Isserman48 /> Conservative politicians such as Congressman [[J. Parnell Thomas]] (R) of [[New Jersey]] attempted to make political hay by intimating that the Roosevelt administration had coddled the country's leading Communist, saying that Browder was \"swaggering [and] apparently untouchable\" despite being Stalin's \"number one stooge in this country.\"<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\nWith popular feeling against Communism raging in the wake of European events and political heat rising in Washington, the Justice Department moved to action. On October 23 a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Browder for passport fraud, a felony.<ref name=Ryan175>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 175.</ref> The formal charge against him specified that Browder had made multiple returns to the United States using a passport bearing his own name, but which had been obtained on the basis of a falsely sworn statement.<ref name=Ryan175 /> Indictments of CPUSA treasurer [[Wiliam Wiener]] and [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] leader [[Harry Gannes]] on passport charges followed in December, and the Communist Party sent several of its top leaders into hiding in anticipation of a broader crackdown.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1940, Browder's trial for passport fraud began at federal court in New York City.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 55.</ref> Browder faced a two-count indictment, upon which conviction would have carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $4,000 fine.<ref name=Ryan179>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 179.</ref> Owing to expiration of the [[statute of limitations]] on earlier passport offenses, the government was able to prosecute Browder only based on his passport use during the years 1937 and 1938.<ref name=Ryan179 /> To aid dramatic effect, recently convicted Soviet spy [[Nicholas Dozenberg]] was placed on the stand to identify Browder's photograph on papers obtained in Dozenberg's name.<ref name=Ryan180>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 180.</ref> After the court refused a long series of motions by Browder's attorney, G. Gordon Battle, Browder took control of his own defense in the courtroom. He reminded jurors that the trial did not concern false documents from the distant past and proclaimed that the actual charges against him were based upon a \"web of technicalities.\"<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 181.</ref>\n\nJury deliberations in the Browder case lasted less than an hour, with a guilty verdict returned.<ref name=Ryan182>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 182.</ref> Browder was sentenced to 4 years in prison and a $2,000 fine\u2014a result less than the maximum but in excess of sentences given to others in similar circumstances.<ref name=Ryan182 /> The conviction was unanimously affirmed on appeal on June 24, 1940, and the [[United States Supreme Court]] concurred on February 17, 1941.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> On March 25, 1941, Browder surrendered to U.S. marshals, who transported him by rail to the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]].<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 192.</ref>\n\nTwo days later, with his face masked behind a pillowcase to hinder photographers, Earl Browder was led into the penitentiary to begin serving his four-year term.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 85\u201386.</ref> He would not emerge again for 14 months.\n\n=== Wartime leader ===\nWhile Browder was imprisoned, the war continued, with major events in Europe and the Pacific. On June 22, 1941, some 3.9 million [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops, led by Nazi Germany, launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], a massive and bloody invasion of the Soviet Union. Immediately the political line of the entire world communist movement shifted from one of anti-intervention in the so-called \"imperialist war\" to one of shrill advocacy for anti-fascist intervention; the slogan was \"Defend the Soviet Union.\"<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 103.</ref> On July 12 the governments of Great Britain and the USSR exchanged pledges of mutual aid, setting the stage for military cooperation between the capitalist nations of the West and their historic Bolshevik foe.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 108.</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the air force of imperial [[Japan]] launched a sudden and devastating [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack upon the American naval base at Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]. A German declaration of war on the United States followed, and direct American participation in the Second World War was begun. The interests of the American government, the Soviet government, and the American Communist Party became aligned.\n\nIn the Atlanta prison, treatment of Browder was relaxed, and he began to be allowed regular visits from acting CPUSA leader [[Robert Minor]].<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> The Communist Party had previously conducted a \"Free Earl Browder\" campaign on behalf of its jailed leader but with little success, owing to bitter public sentiment over the USSR's pact with Nazi Germany and the CPUSA's kowtowing to Moscow's policy shift. By early 1942, however the party's pleas on behalf of Browder began to gain traction among government officials.<ref name=Isserman131>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 131.</ref>\n\nOn May 16, 1942, just prior to a visit to the United States by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], Foreign Minister of the USSR, President Roosevelt decided to remove a minor impediment to the closest possible wartime relations between the two powers by commuting Browder's sentence to time served.<ref name=Isserman131 /> In a statement to the press, the Roosevelt administration said that Browder's early release would \"have a tendency to promote national unity and allay any feeling...that the unusually long sentence in Browder's case was by way of penalty upon him because of his political views.\"<ref>Quoted in Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 131.</ref>\n\nBrowder discreetly returned to New York City, where he resumed his place as General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA. Throughout the early years of the war, the CPUSA agitated for the establishment of a second military front in Europe to alleviate pressure exerted by Axis forces upon the Soviets in the east. The Communists proved to be enthusiastic supporters of the war effort, and the party press worked to mobilize public sentiment by printing accounts of Nazi atrocities in Germany and abroad.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 132\u2013133.</ref> Browder directed Communist Party members to concentrate upon \"problems of a centralized war economy and production for the war,\" using their place in the labor movement to help ameliorate labor discord.<ref>''The Daily Worker'', December 16, 1942, pp. 5\u20136. Quoted in Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBrowder did not personally devise the wartime policies of the CPUSA; the main elements of party policy, such as advocacy of an immediate second front, opposition to strikes, an end to racial discrimination in job hiring, and total support of Roosevelt's internal policy initiatives, were already well established by the time of his release in May 1942.<ref name=Isserman145>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 145.</ref> Nevertheless, Browder became the public spokesman for these policies, and published a book in the fall of 1942, called ''Victory and After'', which was frank in promoting [[class collaboration]] as essential to the cause of victory.<ref name=Isserman145 />\n\nBrowder postulated that the cooperation between America and the Soviet Union would continue into the postwar period.<ref name=Isserman145 /> A victory of the \"United Nations\" would \"make possible the solution of reconstruction problems with a minimum of social disorder and civil violence in the various countries most concerned.\"<ref>Earl Browder, ''Victory and After''. New York: International Publishers, 1942; pg. 113. Quoted in Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 145\u2013146.</ref> This belief in longterm cooperation between the Allied powers abroad and civil peace at home were the hallmarks of what was later known as \"Browderism.\"\n\nBy the end of 1943 the tide of the war in Europe had shifted, and there was no doubt either about the survival of the USSR or the ultimate outcome of the Second World War.<ref name=Isserman187>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 187.</ref> With the [[Red Army]] moving inexorably westward, the possibility of a Communist Europe seemed within reach to the party faithful.<ref name=Isserman187 /> Cooperation between the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union was at its zenith following the conclusion of the [[Tehran Conference]], held November 28 to December 1, 1943.\n\nOn January 7, 1944, the 28 members of the governing [[National Committee of the Communist Party USA|National Committee of the CPUSA]] were called into session in New York City.<ref name=Isserman188>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 188.</ref> Although they usually conducted their business in closed executive session, the members of the National Committee were surprised to learn that their session was to be held in a large room in front of about 200 invited guests.<ref name=Isserman188 /> In his keynote report to the gathering, General Secretary Browder revisited the close cooperation indicated at the Tehran Conference and declared that \"Capitalism and Socialism have begun to find their way to [[peaceful coexistence]] and collaboration in the same world.\"<ref>Quoted in Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 188.</ref>\n\nThe Communist Party was advancing its policy initiatives through political cooperation with New Deal supporters, Browder indicated, and he declared that \"Communist organization in the United States should adjust its name to correspond more exactly to the American political tradition and its own practical political role.\"<ref>Quoted in Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 190.</ref> Consequently, the name of the Communist Party USA would be changed to the \"Communist Political Association,\" Browder noted \u2014 advising those gathered of a decision which had already been made by the Political Bureau of the party.<ref name=Isserman190>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 190.</ref> The speakers following Browder lent individual support to the predetermined change of party name and shift in conception of the organization's role in the American political firmament.<ref name=Isserman190 />\n\nThe National Committee voted unanimously in support of Browder's proposals. They established committees to draft a new constitution for the organization and to prepare for a May 1944 convention to ratify the changes.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 191.</ref> Factional opposition to Browder's change took the form of a letter to the party leadership by Browder's nemesis [[William Z. Foster]] and Foster's friend, Philadelphia District Organizer [[Sam Darcy]], signed only by the former.<ref>Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kirill M. Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998; pg. 93.</ref> The pair disagreed with Browder's view that the [[bourgeoisie]] would continue its wartime coordination with the Roosevelt administration after the war, and predicted a breakdown that would require an aggressive response by American Communists.<ref>Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nBrowder allowed the Foster-Darcy letter to be circulated only to a handful of top party leaders, who at a February 1944 meeting of the Politburo voted to reject the letter.<ref name=KHA94>Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 94.</ref> Foster's objection was muted when Browder emphasized that open criticism would have been regarded as a punishable breach of party discipline.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 192\u2013193.</ref> Darcy refused to submit to party discipline on this matter, however, viewing it as a matter of fundamental principle. He was subsequently expelled from the CPA by a committee headed by Foster himself.<ref name=KHA94 />\n\n=== Postwar expulsion from the CPUSA ===\nWith the end of the Great Power alliance at the end of World War II and the beginning of the [[Cold War]], so-called \"Browderism\" was attacked by the rest of the international Communist movement. They particularly criticized the restructuring of the American party in 1944. In April 1945 the [[Communist Party of France|French Communist Party's]] theoretical magazine, ''Les Cahiers du communisme'', published an article by French party leader [[Jacques Duclos]] that declared that Browder's beliefs about a harmonious post-war world were \"erroneous conclusions in no wise flowing from a Marxist analysis of the situation.\"<ref name=QuoteKHA95>Quoted in Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 95.</ref> Duclos held that Browder's \"liquidation of the independent political party of the working class\" constituted a \"notorious revision of Marxism.\"<ref name=QuoteKHA95 />\n\nAmerican Communists realized that the [[Duclos letter]] was initiated by Moscow, which had been largely out of contact since it had liquidated the [[Communist International]] in 1943 as its own gesture to wartime harmony. Duclos otherwise had no reason to criticize the activity of a fraternal party, American Communists maintained.<ref name=KHA95>Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 95.</ref> Moreover, Duclos quoted directly from the Foster-Darcy letter \u2014 a document known to only a handful of top American party leaders, with a copy dispatched to Moscow.<ref name=KHA95 />\n\nAn interview with [[Gil Green (politician)|Gil Green]] by Anders Stephanson was published in the 1993 anthology ''New Studies in the Politics and Culture of U.S. Communism'', edited by Michael F. Brown, Randy Martin, Frank Rosengarten, and George Snedeker. This exchange was included:\n\n{{Quote|text=''AS'': But in 1945 Browder went out as a result of Duclos' attack on his coalition line.\n\n''GG'': I was terribly shocked by the article. But in my naivet\u00e9 and innocence, I was shocked because I was supposed to have been involved in what was a betrayal of Marxism. This was undoubtedly coming from Moscow, and had greater significance than an article by some leader of the French party who suddenly attacks the line of the American party without even letting us know his views beforehand. According to the Italians, later on, there is evidence that it was not aimed so much at Browder and the party here as at the Italian and French parties. The fear was that, with their underground fighting against the Nazis, they would emerge with tremendous prestige and be able to take an independent course. And while the blow was struck against us here, it wasn't necesaarily concerned with us alone.<ref>Stephanson, Anders, and Gil Green. \"Interview with Gil Green.\" Ed. Michael E.

Print.</ref>}}\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians [[Harvey Klehr]], [[John Earl Haynes]] and Kyrill Anderson discovered a letter in the Soviet Archives showing that the \"Duclos Letter\" had actually been written in Russian and published in Moscow in early 1945, while the war with Germany was still in progress. The timing of the original showed that the USSR had already decided post-war relations with the U.S. would not be friendly. The Russian-language original was translated into French and given to Duclos after the Japanese surrender, with instructions for him to publish it under his own name.<ref>[[Harvey Klehr|Klehr, Harvey]], [[John Earl Haynes|Haynes, John Earl]] and Anderson, Kyrill M. ''The Soviet World of American Communism''. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998.)</ref>\n\nThe American Communists quickly reversed Browder's political line, stripping him of executive power in June 1945 and reconstituting itself as the Communist Party of the United States of America at a snap convention held in July.<ref name=KHA95 /> Predictably, Bill Foster, elevated in stature by being quoted in the \"Duclos letter\", led the opposition to Browder and \"Browderism\". He was named to replace \"the man from Kansas\" as party Chairman in 1945. [[Eugene Dennis]], an individual held in high esteem by Moscow, was named Browder's successor to the more important position of General Secretary.<ref name=KHA96>Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 96.</ref>\n\nIn January 1946 Browder began publishing a [[mimeograph]]ed weekly newsletter of economic analysis called ''Distributors Guide: Economic Analysis: A Service for Policy Makers''.<ref name=Jaffe138>[[Philip J. Jaffe]], ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism''. New York: Horizon Press, 1975; pg. 138.</ref> The subscription price was hefty\u2014$100 per year; he wanted to gain a readership among business executives and political decision-makers.<ref name=Jaffe138 /> Browder produced a total of 16 issues, each based on his vision of Soviet-American cooperation, as opposed to the unfolding Cold War between the powers.<ref name=Jaffe138 /> The Communist Party regarded his independent publication as further evidence of a serious breach of party discipline. On February 5, 1946, Earl Browder was expelled from the CPUSA.<ref>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pg. 139.</ref>\n\n=== Soviet \"literary agent\" ===\nBrowder applied for a visa to travel to Moscow to appeal his expulsion, but he was forced to wait two months for its approval.<ref name=Jaffe140>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pg. 140.</ref> In the meantime he continued to issue his ''Distributors Guide'', which became explicitly more pro-Stalin and pro-Soviet in later issues.<ref name=Jaffe140 /> With his visa finally approved, Browder ended publication of his newsletter at the end of April 1946. The former American party leader departed for the Soviet Union to determine whether his expulsion could be overturned.<ref name=Jaffe140 /> Browder arrived in Moscow on May 3 and met with old friends, including [[Solomon Lozovsky]], former head of the [[Profintern]], as well as Stalin's right-hand man, [[Viacheslav Molotov]].<ref>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nMolotov was unable to intercede on Browder's behalf to reintegrate him into an American Communist Party. By then its leaders regarded him as an undisciplined opportunist and unreliable leader. However, his past service was rewarded with an appointment as \"American Representative of the State Publishing House\" for publication of Soviet books in the United States.<ref>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pp. 141-142.</ref> Upon his return, Browder registered with the [[United States Department of Justice]] as a foreign agent, as required by law. He acted as a sort of literary agent for the Soviet government, receiving English translations of various books and articles and attempting to gain placement for them with American publishers.<ref name=Jaffe142>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pg. 142.</ref> While generally unsuccessful at gaining such publication, Browder met monthly with the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, DC. He provided him with written memoranda on the situation in the United States in general and the Communist Party of the United States of America, in particular \u2014 effectively providing analysis on behalf of Soviet intelligence.<ref name=Jaffe142 />\n\nIn April 1950, Browder was called to testify before a Senate Committee investigating Communist activity. Questioned by [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wis), Browder openly criticized the American Communist Party but refused to answer questions that would incriminate former comrades. He also claimed under oath that he had never been involved in espionage activities.<ref>James G. Ryan, ''Socialist Triumph as a Family Value: Earl Browder and Soviet Espionage'', ''American Communist History'', 1, no. 2 (December 2002).</ref> Browder was charged with contempt of Congress, but Judge [[F. Dickinson Letts]] ordered his acquittal because he felt the committee had not acted legally. Browder was never prosecuted for his perjury before the committee nor for his spying on behalf of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn March 1950, Browder shared a platform with [[Max Shachtman]], the dissident [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], in which the pair debated Socialism. Browder defended the Soviet Union while Shachtman acted as a prosecutor. Reportedly at one point in the debate, Shachtman listed a series of leaders of various Communist parties and noted that each had died at the hands of Stalin. At the end of this speech, he noted that Browder, too, had been a leader of a Communist Party and, pointing at him, said: \"There-there but for an accident of geography, stands a corpse!\"<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/shachtma/1950/03/russia.htm ''Is Russia a Socialist Community? The Verbatim Text of a Debate''.], Marxists website, March 1950</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Twentieth Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956, a period in which some within the American Communist Party briefly sought to exert its independence from Moscow, another effort was made to reintegrate Browder into the CPUSA. This effort at [[liberalization]] was soon defeated, however.\n\n=== Death and legacy ===\nAlthough remaining committed to the cause of socialism, Browder never belonged to the Communist Party again. He died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] on June 27, 1973. He was survived by three sons, [[Felix Browder|Felix]], [[William Browder (mathematician)|William]], and [[Andrew Browder|Andrew]], all distinguished research mathematicians who have been leaders in the American mathematical community.\n\nHis grandson [[Bill Browder]] (son of Felix) was co-founder and head of the investment group [[Hermitage Capital Management]], which operated for more than 10 years in [[Moscow]] during a wave of privatization after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. Browder became a British citizen in 1998, to avoid US taxes on foreign investments. Earl Browder's great-grandson, [[Joshua Browder]], is a British-American entrepreneur, consumer rights activist, and public figure.\n\n== Espionage activities ==\n\nOn June 2, 1957, Browder appeared on the television program ''[[The Mike Wallace Interview]]'', where he was grilled for 30 minutes about his past in the Communist Party. Host [[Mike Wallace]] quoted Browder as having recently said, \"Getting thrown out of the Communist Party was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"<ref name=\"Wallace\">[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/browder_earl_t.html \"The Mike Wallace Interview. Guest: Earl Browder,\"] June 2, 1957. Retrieved October 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Browder replied:\n\n<blockquote>That's right. I meant that the Communist Party and the whole communist movement was changing its character, and in 1945, when I was kicked out, the parting of the ways had come, and if I hadn't been kicked out I would have had the difficult task of disengaging myself from a movement that I could no longer agree with and no longer help.<ref name=\"Wallace\" /></blockquote>\n\n\"I was involved in no conspiracies,\" Browder adamantly declared to Wallace and his television audience.<ref name=\"Wallace\" />\n\nBrowder repeatedly connected [[Jacob Golos]], a longtime Communist Party activist and Soviet agent, with CPUSA members who had offered to share sensitive information that they thought the party should know.<ref>Kathryn S. Olmsted, ''Red Spy Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth Bentley''. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2002; p. 22.</ref> While initially most of these would-be informants were employees of private industry, party members who were employees of the federal government were later also brought into Golos' circle of contacts.<ref>Olmsted, ''Red Spy Queen'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref> Browder was also periodically given access to important information by Golos before its transmission to his superiors in Moscow.<ref>Olmsted, ''Red Spy Queen'', p. 43.</ref>\n\nBrowder's public protestations against accusations of spying were contradicted by the 1995 release of the so-called [[Venona]] documents. This secretly decoded material confirmed that Browder was engaged in recruiting potential espionage agents for Soviet intelligence during the 1940s.<ref name=\"Haynes\">[[John Earl Haynes|Haynes, John Earl]], and [[Harvey Klehr|Klehr, Harvey]], ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America''.

According to a 1938 letter from Browder to [[Georgi Dimitrov]], then General Secretary of the Comintern, Browder's younger sister Marguerite was an agent working in various European countries for the [[NKVD]]. (The letter was found in the Comintern archives after the fall of the Soviet Union.)<ref>Klehr, Haynes, and Firsov, ''Secret World of American Communism'' 241</ref> Browder expressed concern over the effect on the American public if his sister's secret work for Soviet intelligence were to be exposed: \"In view of my increasing involvement in national political affairs and growing connections in Washington political circles ... it might become dangerous to this political work if hostile circles in America should obtain knowledge of my sister's work.\" He requested she be released from her European duties and returned to America to serve \"in other fields of activity.\" Dimitrov forwarded Browder's request to [[Nikolai Yezhov]], then head of the NKVD, requesting Marguerite Browder's transfer.<ref>Klehr, Haynes, and Firsov ''Secret World of American Communism'' 243</ref>\n\nBrowder's half-niece, [[Helen Lowry]] (''aka'' Elza Akhmerova, also Elsa Akhmerova), worked with [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], a Soviet NKVD espionage controller, from 1936\u20131939 under the code name ''ADA''<sup>(?)

Browder was the General Secretary of the CPUSA during the 1930s and first half of the 1940s.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Browder served time in federal prison as a [[conscientious objector]] to [[conscription]] and the war. Upon his release, Browder became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the [[Communist International]] and its [[Red International of Labor Unions]] in [[China]] and the Pacific region.\n\nIn 1930, following the removal of a rival political faction from leadership, Browder was made General Secretary of the CPUSA. For the next 15 years thereafter Browder was the most recognizable public figure associated with American Communism, authoring dozens of pamphlets and books, making numerous public speeches before sometimes vast audiences, and twice running for [[President of the United States]]. Browder also took part in activities on behalf of [[Soviet espionage in the United States|Soviet intelligence in America]] during his period of party leadership, placing those who sought to convey sensitive information to the party into contact with Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn the wake of public outrage over the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939 Nazi\u2013Soviet pact]], Browder was indicted for passport fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] affirmed the sentence and Browder began what proved to be a 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity.\n\nBrowder was a staunch adherent of close cooperation between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and envisioned continued cooperation between these two military powers in the postwar years. Coming to see the role of American Communists to be that of an organized [[pressure group]] within a broad governing coalition, in 1944 he directed the transformation of the CPUSA into a \"Communist Political Association.\" However, following the death of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a [[Cold War]] and [[Second Red Scare|internal red scare]] quickly sprouted up. Browder was expelled from the re-established Communist Party early in 1946, due largely to a refusal to modify these views to accord with changing political realities and their associated ideological demands.\n\nBrowder lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity at his home in [[Yonkers, New York]] and later in Princeton, New Jersey, where he died. He wrote numerous books and pamphlets on political issues.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nEarl Browder was born on May 20, 1891 in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the eighth child of Martha Jane (Hankins) and William Browder, a teacher and farmer.<ref>[https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/b/browder_e.htm]</ref> His father was sympathetic to [[populism]].<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\">Theodore Draper'', The Roots of American Communism'', pg. 308</ref> He joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] in Wichita in 1907 at the age of 16 and remained in that organization until the party split of 1912, when many of the group's members who supported the [[syndicalist]] ideal exited the party after it added an anti-[[sabotage]] clause to the party constitution and the recall of National Executive Committeeman [[William \"Big Bill\" Haywood]].<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\" /> Historian Theodore Draper notes that Browder \"was influenced by an offshoot of the syndicalist movement which believed in working in the AF of L ([[American Federation of Labor]]).\"<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\" /> This ideological orientation brought the young Browder into contact with [[William Z. Foster]], founder of an organization called the [[Syndicalist League of North America]] which was based upon similar policies and [[James P. Cannon]], an IWW adherent from Kansas.\n\nBrowder moved to Kansas City and was employed as an office worker, entering the AFofL union of his trade, the Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants union.<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 308\" /> In 1916 he took a job as manager of the Johnson County Cooperative Association in [[Olathe, Kansas]].\n\n[[File:Browder-earl-prison1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prison photo of Earl Browder, December 1917.]]\n\nBrowder was aggressively opposed to [[World War I]] and publicly spoke out against it, characterizing the fighting as an [[imperialist]] conflict. After the United States joined the war in 1917, Browder was arrested and charged under the [[Espionage Act]] conspiring to defeat the operation of the draft law and nonregistration.<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\">Theodore Draper'', The Roots of American Communism'', pg. 309</ref> Browder was sentenced to two years in prison for conspiracy and a year for nonregistration,<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\" /> sitting in jail from December 1917 to November 1918.\n\nIn 1919, Browder, Cannon and their Kansas City associates started a radical newspaper, ''The Workers World'', with Browder serving as the first editor. In June of that year Browder was jailed again on a conspiracy charge, however, with Cannon taking over as editor.<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\" /> Browder's second prison stint, served at [[Leavenworth Penitentiary]], lasted until November 1920, putting him out of circulation during the critical interval when the [[Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party]] quit the SPA to form the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of America]] and the [[Communist Labor Party of America]].<ref name=\"Theodore Draper pg. 309\" /> A series of splits and mergers followed, with the two Communist parties formally merging in 1921.\n\nReleased from prison at last, Browder lost no time in joining the [[United Communist Party]] (UCP), as well as the fledgling [[Trade Union Educational League]] (TUEL) being launched by his old associate William Z. Foster. Browder found employment as the managing editor of the monthly magazine of TUEL, ''The Labor Herald''.\n\nIn 1920 the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) headed by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] decided to establish an international confederation of Communist trade unions, the [[Profintern|Red International of Labor Unions]] (RILU, or \"Profintern\"). A founding convention was planned to be held in Moscow in July 1921 and an American delegation was gathered, including members of the American Communist Parties and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. Earl Browder was named to this delegation, ostensibly representing Kansas miners, with the non-party man Foster attending as a journalist representing the [[Federated Press]].<ref>Theodore Draper'', The Roots of American Communism'', pg. 316</ref> This trip to Soviet Russia incidentally proved decisive in bringing the syndicalist Foster over to the Communist movement.\n\nThroughout the early 1920s, Browder and Foster worked together closely in the TUEL, trying to win over the support of the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]] in the establishment of a new mass [[Farmer-Labor Party]] that would be able to challenge the electoral hegemony of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties.\n\nIn 1928, the estranged Browder and his girlfriend [[Kitty Harris]] went to [[China]] and lived in [[Shanghai]] where Browder served as Secretary of the RILU's [[Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat]], a clandestine labor organization working to unify the labor movement of Asia and the nations of the [[Pacific basin]].  The pair returned to the United States in January 1929.<ref name=Ryan37>James G. Ryan, ''Earl Browder: The Failure of American Communism''.

Lovestone was Executive Secretary of the CPUSA from the death of [[C.E. Ruthenberg]] in early 1927 to the middle of 1929.]]\n\nThe year 1929 marked a major turn in the Communist Party of the United States of America. Party leader [[Jay Lovestone]], having won a massive factional victory over the Chicago-based rival group headed by [[William Z. Foster]] at the 6th National Convention of the organization, ran afoul of the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) and the [[Third Period|ultra-radical program]] which the member organizations of the Comintern were instructed to pursue. Lovestone headed a 10-member delegation to [[Moscow]] to appeal his case to the American Commission of ECCI; things did not go well for him and in the squabble over autonomy Lovestone attempted a factional coup involving the seizure of party assets.\n\nOn May 17, 1929, ECCI ordered the removal of Lovestone.<ref name=Ryan37 /> He was replaced on a provisional basis by a five-person secretariat which included former Lovestone associate [[Max Bedacht]] as \"Acting Secretary\" and well as opposition factional leader and trade union chief Bill Foster; two relatively independent figures in the persons of cartoonist-turned-functionary [[Robert Minor]] and former Executive Secretary of the underground party [[Will Weinstone]]; and Comintern Representative [[Boris Mikhailov (Comintern)|Boris Mikhailov]] ([[pseudonym]] \"G. Williams\") as the unpublicized power behind the throne.<ref name=Ryan37 />\n\nWhile the center of gravity in the leadership of the CPUSA was rapidly shifted, Browder remained largely outside of the ongoing machinations of power, continuing to function as an employee of the Comintern. In August 1929 Browder was dispatched to [[Vladivostok]], located in the far eastern reaches of Soviet [[Siberia]] on the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] coastline, to attend the final formal gathering of RILU's [[Pan Pacific Trade Union Secretariat]].<ref name=Ryan37 />\n\nBrowder returned to the United States again in October 1929, just in time for a critical plenary session of the Central Committee of the American party.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Allies in the Comintern had already begun to promote the trusted Browder as the best figure to head the American Communist Party, with [[Solomon Lozovsky]] taking up his banner in Moscow while Mikhailov-Williams lent his support from America.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Foster's credibility had been badly tarnished in Moscow as a result of his role as a leader of the frequently unprincipled factional war which had paralyzed the American party throughout the decade of the 1920s.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Placing Browder \u2014 the man responsible for bringing Foster into the Communist movement \u2014 in authority was seen as a means for shifting power decisively away from the former Lovestone group without opening a new round of factional warfare which would have inevitably resulted had the mantle been given directly to Foster.\n\nBrowder deferred from the position of party Secretary, however, not feeling himself sufficiently acclimated to the political situation in the CPUSA.<ref name=Ryan37 /> The October plenum therefore returned Bedacht and Minor to a collective leadership, dropping Foster and Weinstone.<ref name=Ryan37 /> Weinstone was named as the new American Representative to the Comintern,<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 37\u201338.</ref> replacing the recently expelled righthand man of Jay Lovestone, [[Bertram D. Wolfe]], in the position. Browder was added to this new three member Secretariat, named head of the party's Agitation and Propaganda department.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 38.</ref>\n\n=== Rise to party leadership ===\n[[File:Weinstone-will-1927.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Will Weinstone as he appeared in 1927. Weinstone was one of the main contenders for leadership of the CPUSA in the years after the fall of Jay Lovestone in 1929.]]\n\nThe 4th quarter of 1929 saw the wheels fall off the wagon, marked by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|October 24 Wall Street Crash]] and the beginning of a massive economic contraction remembered to history as the [[Great Depression]]. As head of the CPUSA's Agitprop, Browder was responsible for generating party literature intended to transform the [[unemployment]] crisis into a mass movement for revolutionary change.<ref name=Ryan40>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 40.</ref> Browder was instrumental in planning American activities relating to [[International Unemployment Day]], March 6, 1930 \u2014 an international day of mass protest, set in motion by the Comintern, against unemployment.<ref name=Ryan40 /> A network of [[Unemployed Councils]] were established under Communist Party auspices.<ref name=Ryan41>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 41.</ref>\n\nAnother change of the top level leadership of the CPUSA took place at the party's 7th National Convention of June 21\u201325, 1930.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 45\u201346.</ref> Max Bedacht, formerly a top figure in the hierarchy of the Lovestone faction who had only recanted his views at the 11th hour in front of the American Commission of ECCI in Moscow was removed as Secretary and moved to a less sensitive leadership role as head of the [[International Workers Order]]. A new three person Secretariat was appointed, with Browder as Secretary of the political department while Will Weinstone and Bill Foster heading the organizational and trade union departments, respectively.<ref name=Ryan46>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 46.</ref> With Weinstone in Moscow as the CPUSA's Comintern Rep and Foster in jail for his connection with the March 6 International Unemployment Day demonstration, which had ended in street fighting in New York City, Browder's position as chief decision-maker of the party was at least temporarily bolstered.<ref name=Ryan46 />\n\nBrowder's status as the de facto first among equals among members of the Secretariat of the American CP was further emphasized at the [[11th Plenum of the Comintern]], held from March 26 to April 11, 1931. There it was Browder who delivered the main report of the CPUSA, indicative of his prime position in the organization.<ref>Harvey Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade''. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 25.</ref>\n\nTension developed between the trio, with Foster seeing his long-desired place as CPUSA chief foiled by a man who had formerly been his lieutenant at the Trade Union Educational League; both the midwesterners distrusted the ambitious, college-educated New Yorker Weinstone.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 47.</ref> Browder's considerable administrative skills, his ability to intelligently defend his ideas, and his willingness to yield to others when necessary scored points for his personal cause in Moscow.<ref name=Ryan49>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 49.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1932 Browder's primary leadership role was consolidated.<ref name=Ryan49 /> When Weinstone returned from Moscow anxious to once again pursue party leadership positions, protracted squabbling over party policy threatened to erupt into a 1920s-style factional war.<ref name=Ryan52>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 52.</ref> In August the Comintern Representative, sensing such a danger, advised Moscow of \"some strong person\" to stop the \"squabbling.\"<ref>Quoted in Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 53.</ref> The third member of the Secretariat, William Z.

In the spring of 1933 he obtained the final test of strength he had been looking for, in the form of a dozen meetings of the Comintern's Anglo-American Secretariat in Moscow spread out over 29 days.<ref name=Ryan58>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 58.</ref> Throughout April Browder and Weinstone leveled charges and counter-charges against one another, examining the Communist Party's activities in the United States in fine detail.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Despite significant criticism of certain of his actions, Browder emerged from the Moscow sessions in a firm position of authority. Weinstone, accepting defeat at last, remained in Moscow as the CPUSA's CI Rep until 1934.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 59.</ref>\n\n=== Leader of the Popular Front ===\n[[File:37-howard-this4thofjuly.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Cover of a patriotic \"penny pamphlet\" of the Communist Party USA from the \"Communism is 20th Century Americanism\" campaign of the late 1930s.]]\n\nWhile Earl Browder was one of the top leaders of American Communism during the so-called Third Period of the early 1930s, he came into his own during the interval which followed, the era of the [[Popular front|Popular Front]] against [[fascism]]. With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] to Chancellor of [[Germany]] at the end of January 1933, the balance of power in Europe was shifted. Formerly home to one of the most powerful Communist organizations, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was quickly suppressed. The failure of the KPD to cooperate with workers adhering to the rival [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) was seen by many Comintern officials as a major contributing factor to the disaster. New tactics building a broad alliance in opposition to fascism seemed to be indicated.\n\nBrowder was an enthusiastic supporter of this new [[party line (politics)|party line]]. By the middle of 1934 the Browder-led Central Committee of the CPUSA was pushing the leaders of its youth section, the [[Young Communist League USA|Young Communist League]], to establish a working alliance with the youth section of the rival Socialist Party, the [[Young People's Socialist League (1907)|Young People's Socialist League]].<ref name=Ryan76>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 76.</ref> In the same vein, Browder himself picked up hints from Socialist Party leader [[Norman Thomas]] that joint work between Socialists and Communists might be possible on specific issues, in reply to which Browder issued a letter formally proposing a large scale united front of the two organizations.<ref name=Ryan76 />\n\nStill imagining President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as a fascist dictator in the making, Browder and the Communists began to examine their political isolation from the American working class and to envision the establishment of a new labor party which would include both Communists and Socialists within its ranks.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 77\u201378.</ref> In December 1934 Browder won Comintern approval for his scheme, arguing his case in person in Moscow.<ref name=Ryan78>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 78.</ref> Browder returned to the United States at the end of the month, revealing his plan to a surprised party membership in a public speech delivered on January 6, 1935.<ref name=Ryan78 /> The Socialist Party, for its part, remained skeptical, having been on the receiving end of more than a decade's worth of vilification and violence.\n\nIn conjunction with its newly found interest in building bridges with non-Communist progressives, the CPUSA launched potent new [[mass organization]]s such as the [[American League Against War and Fascism]] (September 1933), the [[American Youth Congress]] (1935), and the [[League of American Writers]] (April 1935). Moreover, as the 1930s progressed and the [[New Deal]] policies of the Roosevelt administration became established, the Browder-led Communist Party moved from a position of bitter opposition to critical support.\n\nAfter 1935 the Communist Party maintained only nominal opposition to the Roosevelt administration, with Browder heading the party's 1936 ticket as its candidate for President in the [[1936 U.S. presidential election|election of 1936]]. He received 80,195 votes.\n\nIn practice, progressives of both parties were seen as key constituents in a broad \"People's Front\" against fascism and a bulwark of the movement for [[collective security]] in Europe against German aggression. The Communist Party attenuated its message of the historical inevitability of revolution, emphasizing progressive trends in American history and attempting to cast itself as an indigenous reform movement under the slogan \"Communism is 20th Century Americanism.\"<ref name=Isserman9>Maurice Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On? The American Communist Party During the Second World War''. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1982; pg. 9.</ref> The stark phraseology of [[Marxism]], based upon the inevitability of [[class struggle]], was replaced by a fuzzy critique of capitalism using Rooseveltian terms like \"economic royalism.\"<ref name=Isserman9 />\n\nEarl Browder was not only the leading party decision-maker but also the public face of this effort. He was, one historian later noted, a man who \"paid lip service to 'proletarian internationalism'\" and who \"knew better than to oppose Soviet-imposed policies, however inappropriate they might be for American conditions,\" but who \"wanted to be a leader of a national movement with power and influence of its own.\"<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nThe \"Communism is 20th Century Americanism\" campaign, during which Communism was portrayed as an integral part of the American democratic tradition, was successful in building the size and scope of the party organization. But with this growth came a correlated expansion of Browder's personal ego.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 14.</ref> A [[cult of personality]] began to be nurtured among the party faithful in miniature reflection of the systemic adulation of Joseph Stalin in the USSR. In the words of [[Maurice Isserman]]:\n\n<blockquote>The constant praise of his colleagues and the party press, and the adulation in which the membership held him (among his papers Browder saved a letter from a Seattle Communist addressed to the 'Greatest of Living Americans, Earl Browder'), transformed the once unassuming ''apparatchik'' of the 1920s into an arrogant and uncompromising party dictator.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 14\u201315.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBrowder's chief rival in the Communist Party leadership in this interval was William Z. Foster. When a new recession struck in 1937, stifling tax revenue, President Roosevelt and Congress responded by cutting funding for its signature [[Works Progress Administration]] by 50 percent in an attempt to help bring the budget into balance.<ref name=Ryan129>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 129.</ref> Foster sought for the CPUSA to renew a militant stance against capitalism and the government in response to the economic downturn.<ref name=Ryan129 />\n\nBrowder, on the other hand, pushed the party towards moderate criticism of the administration, urging increased expenditures on public works and unemployment relief and lauding Roosevelt's move away from [[isolationism]] in foreign policy in the wake of the rising tide of fascism in Europe.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> A short-lived revival of the Farmer-Labor Party idea was scrapped under Browder's direction, and the New Deal coalition endorsed as the practical base upon which a People's Front could be constructed.<ref name=Ryan129 /> Over question of Foster's militance versus Browder's accommodation with New Deal realities, the Comintern ruled decisively in favor of Browder.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nBrowder made his final trip to the USSR in October 1938, where he made arrangements with Comintern chief [[Georgi Dimitrov]] to establish [[shortwave radio]] communications in the event that international conflict made direct communication impossible.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 46.</ref> No communications of this sort were made until late in September 1939, when the CPUSA's political line on the dramatically changed European situation would be specified.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\n=== Effects of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ===\n[[File:MolotovRibbentropStalin.jpg|thumb|right|240px|With German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and Soviet Communist Party leader Joseph Stalin looking on, [[V.

The agreement included secret protocols providing for the Nazi [[Invasion of Poland|invasion and division of Poland]].

Those who were formerly the greatest cheerleaders for collective security against the danger of Germany now became staunch opponents of American intervention in the European military situation\u2014reflective of the newly revised needs of Soviet foreign policy. All anti-fascist propaganda was immediately terminated, overt criticism of German action was minimized, the culpability of the governments of France and Britain was exaggerated.<ref name=Ottanelli197 /> Browder's CPUSA claimed that Hitler's foes intended to escalate the ongoing European conflict into a counterrevolutionary offensive against the USSR.<ref name=Ottanelli197 />\n\nThe result of the sudden shift of the party line caused shock and confusion among many members of the Communist Party USA, a goodly number of whom had joined during the period of the Popular Front against fascism.<ref name=Ottanelli198>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States'', pg. 198.</ref> Browder declared at one Philadelphia rally that only \"a dozen or so\" had left the CPUSA over the change of line; but the party's ranks fell by 15% between 1939 and 1940, and recruitment of new members in 1940 fell by 75% from 1938 levels.<ref name=Ottanelli198 /> The public image of the USSR as a main bulwark against fascism and claims of the CPUSA as an indigenous radical organization were severely undermined.<ref>Ottanelli, ''The Communist Party of the United States''. pp. 198\u2013199.</ref>\n\nMoreover, the CPUSA's new propaganda offensive against United States participation in the so-called \"Imperialist War\" brought it into political conflict with the Roosevelt administration, which had begun to question the wisdom of isolationism. In the summer of 1939, Texas Congressman [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] (D), chairman of the [[House Special Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC), learned that the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] had begun to investigate old charges that Earl Browder had traveled abroad under assumed names, making use of false documents, during the 1920s.<ref name=Isserman48>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 48.</ref> Dies proceeded to subpoena Browder to appear before the committee to give testimony on the matter.<ref name=Isserman48 /> On September 5, 1939, days after the German invasion of Poland, Browder appeared before HUAC, providing exhaustive testimony over the course of two days.<ref>See: House Special Committee on Un-American Activities, [https://archive.org/details/investigationofu194007unit ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Hearings Before a Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Seventy-Sixth Congress, First Session...: Volume 7, September 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, 1939, at Washington, DC''.] Washington, DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1940; pp. 4275\u20134520.</ref>\n\nMidway through the first day of testimony, Browder was asked in passing whether he had ever traveled abroad under a false passport. Before party attorney [[Joseph Brodsky (attorney)|Joseph Brodsky]] could stop him, Browder answered, \"I have.\"<ref name=Isserman48 /> Although he subsequently refused to answer follow-up questions about the matter, citing the protection against self-incrimination offered by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the damage caused by Browder's admission under oath had been done.<ref name=Isserman48 /> Conservative politicians such as Congressman [[J. Parnell Thomas]] (R) of [[New Jersey]] attempted to make political hay by intimating that the Roosevelt administration had coddled the country's leading Communist, saying that Browder was \"swaggering [and] apparently untouchable\" despite being Stalin's \"number one stooge in this country.\"<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\nWith popular feeling against Communism raging in the wake of European events and political heat rising in Washington, the Justice Department moved to action. On October 23 a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Browder for passport fraud, a felony.<ref name=Ryan175>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 175.</ref> The formal charge against him specified that Browder had made multiple returns to the United States using a passport bearing his own name, but which had been obtained on the basis of a falsely sworn statement.<ref name=Ryan175 /> Indictments of CPUSA treasurer [[Wiliam Wiener]] and [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] leader [[Harry Gannes]] on passport charges followed in December, and the Communist Party sent several of its top leaders into hiding in anticipation of a broader crackdown.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nOn January 17, 1940, Browder's trial for passport fraud began at federal court in New York City.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 55.</ref> Browder faced a two-count indictment, upon which conviction would have carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $4,000 fine.<ref name=Ryan179>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 179.</ref> Owing to expiration of the [[statute of limitations]] on earlier passport offenses, the government was able to prosecute Browder only based on his passport use during the years 1937 and 1938.<ref name=Ryan179 /> To aid dramatic effect, recently convicted Soviet spy [[Nicholas Dozenberg]] was placed on the stand to identify Browder's photograph on papers obtained in Dozenberg's name.<ref name=Ryan180>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 180.</ref> After the court refused a long series of motions by Browder's attorney, G. Gordon Battle, Browder took control of his own defense in the courtroom. He reminded jurors that the trial did not concern false documents from the distant past and proclaimed that the actual charges against him were based upon a \"web of technicalities.\"<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 181.</ref>\n\nJury deliberations in the Browder case lasted less than an hour, with a guilty verdict returned.<ref name=Ryan182>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 182.</ref> Browder was sentenced to 4 years in prison and a $2,000 fine\u2014a result less than the maximum but in excess of sentences given to others in similar circumstances.<ref name=Ryan182 /> The conviction was unanimously affirmed on appeal on June 24, 1940, and the [[United States Supreme Court]] concurred on February 17, 1941.<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> On March 25, 1941, Browder surrendered to U.S. marshals, who transported him by rail to the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]].<ref>Ryan, ''Earl Browder'', pg. 192.</ref>\n\nTwo days later, with his face masked behind a pillowcase to hinder photographers, Earl Browder was led into the penitentiary to begin serving his four-year term.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 85\u201386.</ref> He would not emerge again for 14 months.\n\n=== Wartime leader ===\nWhile Browder was imprisoned, the war continued, with major events in Europe and the Pacific. On June 22, 1941, some 3.9 million [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops, led by Nazi Germany, launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], a massive and bloody invasion of the Soviet Union. Immediately the political line of the entire world communist movement shifted from one of anti-intervention in the so-called \"imperialist war\" to one of shrill advocacy for anti-fascist intervention; the slogan was \"Defend the Soviet Union.\"<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 103.</ref> On July 12 the governments of Great Britain and the USSR exchanged pledges of mutual aid, setting the stage for military cooperation between the capitalist nations of the West and their historic Bolshevik foe.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 108.</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1941, the air force of imperial [[Japan]] launched a sudden and devastating [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack upon the American naval base at Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]. A German declaration of war on the United States followed, and direct American participation in the Second World War was begun. The interests of the American government, the Soviet government, and the American Communist Party became aligned.\n\nIn the Atlanta prison, treatment of Browder was relaxed, and he began to be allowed regular visits from acting CPUSA leader [[Robert Minor]].<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> The Communist Party had previously conducted a \"Free Earl Browder\" campaign on behalf of its jailed leader but with little success, owing to bitter public sentiment over the USSR's pact with Nazi Germany and the CPUSA's kowtowing to Moscow's policy shift. By early 1942, however the party's pleas on behalf of Browder began to gain traction among government officials.<ref name=Isserman131>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 131.</ref>\n\nOn May 16, 1942, just prior to a visit to the United States by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], Foreign Minister of the USSR, President Roosevelt decided to remove a minor impediment to the closest possible wartime relations between the two powers by commuting Browder's sentence to time served.<ref name=Isserman131 /> In a statement to the press, the Roosevelt administration said that Browder's early release would \"have a tendency to promote national unity and allay any feeling...that the unusually long sentence in Browder's case was by way of penalty upon him because of his political views.\"<ref>Quoted in Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 131.</ref>\n\nBrowder discreetly returned to New York City, where he resumed his place as General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA. Throughout the early years of the war, the CPUSA agitated for the establishment of a second military front in Europe to alleviate pressure exerted by Axis forces upon the Soviets in the east. The Communists proved to be enthusiastic supporters of the war effort, and the party press worked to mobilize public sentiment by printing accounts of Nazi atrocities in Germany and abroad.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pp. 132\u2013133.</ref> Browder directed Communist Party members to concentrate upon \"problems of a centralized war economy and production for the war,\" using their place in the labor movement to help ameliorate labor discord.<ref>''The Daily Worker'', December 16, 1942, pp. 5\u20136.

They established committees to draft a new constitution for the organization and to prepare for a May 1944 convention to ratify the changes.<ref>Isserman, ''Which Side Were You On?'' pg. 191.</ref> Factional opposition to Browder's change took the form of a letter to the party leadership by Browder's nemesis [[William Z.

He was subsequently expelled from the CPA by a committee headed by Foster himself.<ref name=KHA94 />\n\n=== Postwar expulsion from the CPUSA ===\nWith the end of the Great Power alliance at the end of World War II and the beginning of the [[Cold War]], so-called \"Browderism\" was attacked by the rest of the international Communist movement. They particularly criticized the restructuring of the American party in 1944. In April 1945 the [[Communist Party of France|French Communist Party's]] theoretical magazine, ''Les Cahiers du communisme'', published an article by French party leader [[Jacques Duclos]] that declared that Browder's beliefs about a harmonious post-war world were \"erroneous conclusions in no wise flowing from a Marxist analysis of the situation.\"<ref name=QuoteKHA95>Quoted in Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 95.</ref> Duclos held that Browder's \"liquidation of the independent political party of the working class\" constituted a \"notorious revision of Marxism.\"<ref name=QuoteKHA95 />\n\nAmerican Communists realized that the [[Duclos letter]] was initiated by Moscow, which had been largely out of contact since it had liquidated the [[Communist International]] in 1943 as its own gesture to wartime harmony. Duclos otherwise had no reason to criticize the activity of a fraternal party, American Communists maintained.<ref name=KHA95>Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 95.</ref> Moreover, Duclos quoted directly from the Foster-Darcy letter \u2014 a document known to only a handful of top American party leaders, with a copy dispatched to Moscow.<ref name=KHA95 />\n\nAn interview with [[Gil Green (politician)|Gil Green]] by Anders Stephanson was published in the 1993 anthology ''New Studies in the Politics and Culture of U.S. Communism'', edited by Michael F. Brown, Randy Martin, Frank Rosengarten, and George Snedeker. This exchange was included:\n\n{{Quote|text=''AS'': But in 1945 Browder went out as a result of Duclos' attack on his coalition line.\n\n''GG'': I was terribly shocked by the article. But in my naivet\u00e9 and innocence, I was shocked because I was supposed to have been involved in what was a betrayal of Marxism. This was undoubtedly coming from Moscow, and had greater significance than an article by some leader of the French party who suddenly attacks the line of the American party without even letting us know his views beforehand. According to the Italians, later on, there is evidence that it was not aimed so much at Browder and the party here as at the Italian and French parties. The fear was that, with their underground fighting against the Nazis, they would emerge with tremendous prestige and be able to take an independent course. And while the blow was struck against us here, it wasn't necesaarily concerned with us alone.<ref>Stephanson, Anders, and Gil Green. \"Interview with Gil Green.\" Ed. Michael E.

Print.</ref>}}\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians [[Harvey Klehr]], [[John Earl Haynes]] and Kyrill Anderson discovered a letter in the Soviet Archives showing that the \"Duclos Letter\" had actually been written in Russian and published in Moscow in early 1945, while the war with Germany was still in progress. The timing of the original showed that the USSR had already decided post-war relations with the U.S. would not be friendly. The Russian-language original was translated into French and given to Duclos after the Japanese surrender, with instructions for him to publish it under his own name.<ref>[[Harvey Klehr|Klehr, Harvey]], [[John Earl Haynes|Haynes, John Earl]] and Anderson, Kyrill M. ''The Soviet World of American Communism''. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998.)</ref>\n\nThe American Communists quickly reversed Browder's political line, stripping him of executive power in June 1945 and reconstituting itself as the Communist Party of the United States of America at a snap convention held in July.<ref name=KHA95 /> Predictably, Bill Foster, elevated in stature by being quoted in the \"Duclos letter\", led the opposition to Browder and \"Browderism\". He was named to replace \"the man from Kansas\" as party Chairman in 1945. [[Eugene Dennis]], an individual held in high esteem by Moscow, was named Browder's successor to the more important position of General Secretary.<ref name=KHA96>Klehr, Haynes, and Anderson, ''The Soviet World of American Communism'', pg. 96.</ref>\n\nIn January 1946 Browder began publishing a [[mimeograph]]ed weekly newsletter of economic analysis called ''Distributors Guide: Economic Analysis: A Service for Policy Makers''.<ref name=Jaffe138>[[Philip J. Jaffe]], ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism''. New York: Horizon Press, 1975; pg. 138.</ref> The subscription price was hefty\u2014$100 per year; he wanted to gain a readership among business executives and political decision-makers.<ref name=Jaffe138 /> Browder produced a total of 16 issues, each based on his vision of Soviet-American cooperation, as opposed to the unfolding Cold War between the powers.<ref name=Jaffe138 /> The Communist Party regarded his independent publication as further evidence of a serious breach of party discipline. On February 5, 1946, Earl Browder was expelled from the CPUSA.<ref>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pg. 139.</ref>\n\n=== Soviet \"literary agent\" ===\nBrowder applied for a visa to travel to Moscow to appeal his expulsion, but he was forced to wait two months for its approval.<ref name=Jaffe140>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pg. 140.</ref> In the meantime he continued to issue his ''Distributors Guide'', which became explicitly more pro-Stalin and pro-Soviet in later issues.<ref name=Jaffe140 /> With his visa finally approved, Browder ended publication of his newsletter at the end of April 1946. The former American party leader departed for the Soviet Union to determine whether his expulsion could be overturned.<ref name=Jaffe140 /> Browder arrived in Moscow on May 3 and met with old friends, including [[Solomon Lozovsky]], former head of the [[Profintern]], as well as Stalin's right-hand man, [[Viacheslav Molotov]].<ref>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nMolotov was unable to intercede on Browder's behalf to reintegrate him into an American Communist Party. By then its leaders regarded him as an undisciplined opportunist and unreliable leader. However, his past service was rewarded with an appointment as \"American Representative of the State Publishing House\" for publication of Soviet books in the United States.<ref>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pp. 141-142.</ref> Upon his return, Browder registered with the [[United States Department of Justice]] as a foreign agent, as required by law. He acted as a sort of literary agent for the Soviet government, receiving English translations of various books and articles and attempting to gain placement for them with American publishers.<ref name=Jaffe142>Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism'', pg. 142.</ref> While generally unsuccessful at gaining such publication, Browder met monthly with the second secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, DC. He provided him with written memoranda on the situation in the United States in general and the Communist Party of the United States of America, in particular \u2014 effectively providing analysis on behalf of Soviet intelligence.<ref name=Jaffe142 />\n\nIn April 1950, Browder was called to testify before a Senate Committee investigating Communist activity. Questioned by [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wis), Browder openly criticized the American Communist Party but refused to answer questions that would incriminate former comrades. He also claimed under oath that he had never been involved in espionage activities.<ref>James G. Ryan, ''Socialist Triumph as a Family Value: Earl Browder and Soviet Espionage'', ''American Communist History'', 1, no. 2 (December 2002).</ref> Browder was charged with contempt of Congress, but Judge [[F. Dickinson Letts]] ordered his acquittal because he felt the committee had not acted legally. Browder was never prosecuted for his perjury before the committee nor for his spying on behalf of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn March 1950, Browder shared a platform with [[Max Shachtman]], the dissident [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], in which the pair debated Socialism. Browder defended the Soviet Union while Shachtman acted as a prosecutor. Reportedly at one point in the debate, Shachtman listed a series of leaders of various Communist parties and noted that each had died at the hands of Stalin. At the end of this speech, he noted that Browder, too, had been a leader of a Communist Party and, pointing at him, said: \"There-there but for an accident of geography, stands a corpse!\"<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/shachtma/1950/03/russia.htm ''Is Russia a Socialist Community? The Verbatim Text of a Debate''.], Marxists website, March 1950</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Twentieth Party Congress]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956, a period in which some within the American Communist Party briefly sought to exert its independence from Moscow, another effort was made to reintegrate Browder into the CPUSA. This effort at [[liberalization]] was soon defeated, however.\n\n=== Death and legacy ===\nAlthough remaining committed to the cause of socialism, Browder never belonged to the Communist Party again. He died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] on June 27, 1973. He was survived by three sons, [[Felix Browder|Felix]], [[William Browder (mathematician)|William]], and [[Andrew Browder|Andrew]], all distinguished research mathematicians who have been leaders in the American mathematical community.\n\nHis grandson [[Bill Browder]] (son of Felix) was co-founder and head of the investment group [[Hermitage Capital Management]], which operated for more than 10 years in [[Moscow]] during a wave of privatization after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. Browder became a British citizen in 1998, to avoid US taxes on foreign investments. Earl Browder's great-grandson, [[Joshua Browder]], is a British-American entrepreneur, consumer rights activist, and public figure.\n\n== Espionage activities ==\n\nOn June 2, 1957, Browder appeared on the television program ''[[The Mike Wallace Interview]]'', where he was grilled for 30 minutes about his past in the Communist Party. Host [[Mike Wallace]] quoted Browder as having recently said, \"Getting thrown out of the Communist Party was the best thing that ever happened to me.\"<ref name=\"Wallace\">[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/browder_earl_t.html \"The Mike Wallace Interview. Guest: Earl Browder,\"] June 2, 1957. Retrieved October 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Browder replied:\n\n<blockquote>That's right. I meant that the Communist Party and the whole communist movement was changing its character, and in 1945, when I was kicked out, the parting of the ways had come, and if I hadn't been kicked out I would have had the difficult task of disengaging myself from a movement that I could no longer agree with and no longer help.<ref name=\"Wallace\" /></blockquote>\n\n\"I was involved in no conspiracies,\" Browder adamantly declared to Wallace and his television audience.<ref name=\"Wallace\" />\n\nBrowder repeatedly connected [[Jacob Golos]], a longtime Communist Party activist and Soviet agent, with CPUSA members who had offered to share sensitive information that they thought the party should know.<ref>Kathryn S. Olmsted, ''Red Spy Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth Bentley''. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2002; p. 22.</ref> While initially most of these would-be informants were employees of private industry, party members who were employees of the federal government were later also brought into Golos' circle of contacts.<ref>Olmsted, ''Red Spy Queen'', pp. 22\u201323.</ref> Browder was also periodically given access to important information by Golos before its transmission to his superiors in Moscow.<ref>Olmsted, ''Red Spy Queen'', p. 43.</ref>\n\nBrowder's public protestations against accusations of spying were contradicted by the 1995 release of the so-called [[Venona]] documents. This secretly decoded material confirmed that Browder was engaged in recruiting potential espionage agents for Soviet intelligence during the 1940s.<ref name=\"Haynes\">[[John Earl Haynes|Haynes, John Earl]], and [[Harvey Klehr|Klehr, Harvey]], ''Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America''.

Peters]], after the defection of [[Whittaker Chambers]], allegedly at the request of Browder (Venona code name: FATHER).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  According to self-confessed [[NKVD]] recruiter [[Louis Budenz]], he and Browder participated in discussions with Soviet intelligence officials to plan the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref>''Affidavit of Louis Budenz'', 11 November 1950, American Aspects of the Assassination of Leon Trotsky, U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Un-American Activities, 81st Cong., 2d sess., part I, v\u2013ix.</ref>\n\nWhile in federal custody in the US, Browder never revealed his status as an agent recruiter.

According to a 1938 letter from Browder to [[Georgi Dimitrov]], then General Secretary of the Comintern, Browder's younger sister Marguerite was an agent working in various European countries for the [[NKVD]]. (The letter was found in the Comintern archives after the fall of the Soviet Union.)<ref>Klehr, Haynes, and Firsov, ''Secret World of American Communism'' 241</ref> Browder expressed concern over the effect on the American public if his sister's secret work for Soviet intelligence were to be exposed: \"In view of my increasing involvement in national political affairs and growing connections in Washington political circles ... it might become dangerous to this political work if hostile circles in America should obtain knowledge of my sister's work.\" He requested she be released from her European duties and returned to America to serve \"in other fields of activity.\" Dimitrov forwarded Browder's request to [[Nikolai Yezhov]], then head of the NKVD, requesting Marguerite Browder's transfer.<ref>Klehr, Haynes, and Firsov ''Secret World of American Communism'' 243</ref>\n\nBrowder's half-niece, [[Helen Lowry]] (''aka'' Elza Akhmerova, also Elsa Akhmerova), worked with [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], a Soviet NKVD espionage controller, from 1936\u20131939 under the code name ''ADA''<sup>(?) ADA was [[Kitty Harris]]</sup> (later changed to ''ELZA'')). In 1939, Helen Lowry married Akhmerov.  Lowry was named by Soviet intelligence agent [[Elizabeth Bentley]] as one of her contacts.

Full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Balkans]] initially had a negative impact on trade. However, by the end of the 19th century, the town of Leskovac was famous across the Balkans for its workshops which turned hemp into rope. Leskovac was known as Leskof\u00e7a during Ottoman rule and was bounded to [[Ni\u0161|Ni\u015f]] sanjak until 1878.\n\nSoon there were three watermill-driven lace producers in the region. In 1896, the founders of these companies pooled their resources and bought factory equipment for the production of woollen cloth from the [[German Empire]]. This was the first factory on the outskirts of the town. In 1903, a factory for hemp processing was built on the riverbank north of the old town centre. Amidst the [[First Serbian Uprising]] of the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804\u20131815), a forbidden [[Serbian Orthodox church]] was built in the town, through tricking the Turkish lords that the building would instead serve as a residence for the town-priest, and added a chimney, hence its name ''[[Od\u017eaklija]]'' (''Chimney''). In 1922, the Teokarevi\u0107 family opened a wool cloth factory in the small town of Vu\u010dje near Leskovac. By 1938, the private textile factories of Leskovac town employed 2,560 workers. In the 1870s, there were thousands of hemp-processors in Leskovac, producing up to 150,000 cartloads per year.\nThe city was once known as ''\"Little Manchester\"'', because of its 19th-century textile industry which was second only to that of [[Manchester]], [[England]]. The city continued to be a major textile center until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, but due to the economic isolation of Serbia resulting from ethnic wars, its remote location, and failure to privatize the mills, the industry collapsed resulting in depression of the economy in the area.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"A Serbian Region Unravels With Its Textile Industry\", article by Nicholas Wood in ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 2007</ref>\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Leskovac was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|World War II in Yugoslavia}} [[File:Spomen park NOB, Leskovac 02.jpg|thumb|left|160px|WWII memorial park and \u201cGoddess of Victory\u201d statue]]\nDuring the [[World War II]], the city was part of [[German-occupied Serbia]].

Full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Balkans]] initially had a negative impact on trade. However, by the end of the 19th century, the town of Leskovac was famous across the Balkans for its workshops which turned hemp into rope. Leskovac was known as Leskof\u00e7a during Ottoman rule and was bounded to [[Ni\u0161|Ni\u015f]] sanjak until 1878.\n\nSoon there were three watermill-driven lace producers in the region. In 1896, the founders of these companies pooled their resources and bought factory equipment for the production of woollen cloth from the [[German Empire]]. This was the first factory on the outskirts of the town. In 1903, a factory for hemp processing was built on the riverbank north of the old town centre. Amidst the [[First Serbian Uprising]] of the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804\u20131815), a forbidden [[Serbian Orthodox church]] was built in the town, through tricking the Turkish lords that the building would instead serve as a residence for the town-priest, and added a chimney, hence its name ''[[Od\u017eaklija]]'' (''Chimney''). In 1922, the Teokarevi\u0107 family opened a wool cloth factory in the small town of Vu\u010dje near Leskovac. By 1938, the private textile factories of Leskovac town employed 2,560 workers. In the 1870s, there were thousands of hemp-processors in Leskovac, producing up to 150,000 cartloads per year.\nThe city was once known as ''\"Little Manchester\"'', because of its 19th-century textile industry which was second only to that of [[Manchester]], [[England]]. The city continued to be a major textile center until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, but due to the economic isolation of Serbia resulting from ethnic wars, its remote location, and failure to privatize the mills, the industry collapsed resulting in depression of the economy in the area.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"A Serbian Region Unravels With Its Textile Industry\", article by Nicholas Wood in ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 2007</ref>\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Leskovac was part of the [[Vardar Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|World War II in Yugoslavia}} [[File:Spomen park NOB, Leskovac 02.jpg|thumb|left|160px|WWII memorial park and \u201cGoddess of Victory\u201d statue]]\nDuring the [[World War II]], the city was part of [[German-occupied Serbia]].

Overall, industry has a minor growth, but its growth is safe and in the future, industry will certainly face another growth that will increase its status among Serbia's largest cities. Its main industry is light industry such as textile, household commodities and medical industries. Leskovac has mine of lead and zinc called \"Leskovac Lece\". \n\nThe first boom occurred after WW1 and lasted until 1941. It was \"succeeded\" in the late 1940s. During so called \"Yugoslav economic miracle\" (1950s \u2013 c.1980) Leskovac has developed into not just regional, but textile center in entire Southeast Europe. It became known as \"Serbian Manchester\". Leskovac Lece was constructed during that era.

International trains traveling from Europe to Skopje, Thessalonica and Athens pass through this city. Nineteen trains stop in Leskovac every day. The railway came to Leskovac in 1886. Leskovac today has one of the newest and most modern railway stations in Serbia.\n\nBus traffic is also very well developed, bearing in mind that Leskovac has been criss-crossed with roads. The most important is the [[European route E75|E75 road]] which connects the borders of Hungary and North Macedonia. Regional roads lead from Leskovac to Pri\u0161tina, Pirot and Bosilegrad. The distance from Leskovac to Ni\u0161 is 45, to Belgrade 280, and to Sofia {{convert|155|km|0|abbr=off}}.\n\nLeskovac has a [[Mira Airport|regional airport]], which is commonly used for sporting and agricultural flights. Also in summer the airport is used for air taxi. The nearest international airport is [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] located {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city.\n\n===Environment===\nLeskovac was the first city in Serbia which had a sanitary [[landfill]]. \u017deljkovac depot spreads over 80 hectares and is made by all European standards.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. Tolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the [[Old Norse]] [[Dvergatal|\"Catalogue of Dwarves\" (''Dvergatal'')]] in the ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1''. \n\nAs a wizard and the bearer of a [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]], Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling continually, always focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. He is associated with fire, his ring being [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in [[fireworks]] to entertain the [[hobbit]]s of [[the Shire]], and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the [[Maiar]] he is an immortal spirit, but being in a physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the [[Balrog]] from [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. He is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari.\n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; and as a [[Christ]]-figure, a [[prophet]].\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D. Rateliff |series=[[The History of The Hobbit]] |volume=2 |title=Return to Bag-End |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=2007 |page=Appendix III |nopp=true |isbn=0-00-725066-5}}</ref> In [[Old Norse]], the name means ''staff-elf''. This is reflected in his name ''Thark\u00fbn'', which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man' \" in [[Khuzdul]], one of [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's invented languages]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===In-universe names===\n\nGandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings. Gandalf himself says, \"Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir{{efn|Meaning \"Grey Pilgrim\"}} among the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], Thark\u00fbn to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[#Valinor|Ol\u00f3rin I was in my youth in the West]] that is forgotten, in the South Inc\u00e1nus, in the North ''Gandalf''; to [[Rh\u00fbn|the East]] I go not.\"<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 5, \"The Window on the West\"</ref> In an early manuscript version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', he is called Bladorthin.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D. Rateliff |series=[[The History of The Hobbit]] |volume=1 |title=Mr. Baggins |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=2007 |page=Chapter I(b) |nopp=true |isbn=0-00-725066-5}}</ref>\n\nEach [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizard]] is distinguished by the colour of his cloak. For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Internal biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]]. Sauron, however, has anticipated this and withdraws as a feint, only to reappear in [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 2, \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n\n====Gandalf the Grey====\n\nAs explained in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Gandalf spends the years between ''The Hobbit'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' traveling [[Middle-earth]] in search of information on [[Sauron]]'s resurgence and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s mysterious [[One Ring|ring]], spurred particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a \"present\" from [[Gollum]]. During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is a [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]], one of the ''Istari'' order, and the leader of the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]]. Tolkien took the name \"Gandalf\" from the [[Old Norse]] [[Dvergatal|\"Catalogue of Dwarves\" (''Dvergatal'')]] in the ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1''. \n\nAs a wizard and the bearer of a [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]], Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling continually, always focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord [[Sauron]]. He is associated with fire, his ring being [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in [[fireworks]] to entertain the [[hobbit]]s of [[the Shire]], and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the [[Maiar]] he is an immortal spirit, but being in a physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the [[Balrog]] from [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. He is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the Istari.\n\nTolkien once described Gandalf as an [[angel]] incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Odin]] in his \"Wanderer\" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonist, comparable to the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] who assisted [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[The Aeneid]]'', or to Virgil himself in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; and as a [[Christ]]-figure, a [[prophet]].\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Emblema Gandalf.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Cirth|Certh]] [[rune]] no. 19 \"G\", used by Gandalf as a personal [[sign]] or [[seal (emblem)|seal]]]]\n\n===Etymology===\n\nTolkien derived the name ''Gandalf'' from ''[[Gandalf (mythology)|Gand\u00e1lfr]]'', a [[Norse dwarf|dwarf]] in the [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'s ''Dvergatal'', a list of dwarf-names.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

This is reflected in his name ''Thark\u00fbn'', which is \"said to mean 'Staff-man' \" in [[Khuzdul]], one of [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's invented languages]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===In-universe names===\n\nGandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings. Gandalf himself says, \"Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir{{efn|Meaning \"Grey Pilgrim\"}} among the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], Thark\u00fbn to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], [[#Valinor|Ol\u00f3rin I was in my youth in the West]] that is forgotten, in the South Inc\u00e1nus, in the North ''Gandalf''; to [[Rh\u00fbn|the East]] I go not.\"<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 5, \"The Window on the West\"</ref> In an early manuscript version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', he is called Bladorthin.<ref>{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Rateliff |authorlink=John D.

For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf ''the Grey'', and Grey[[wikt:hame|hame]]. ''Mithrandir'' is a name in [[Sindarin]] meaning \"the Grey Pilgrim\" or \"the Grey Wanderer\". Midway through ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed [[#Gandalf the White|Gandalf the White]]. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as ''Mithrandir''. At times in ''The Lord of the Rings'', other characters address Gandalf by disparaging nicknames:Stormcrow, ''L\u00e1thspell'' (\"Ill-news\" in [[Old English]]), and \"Grey Fool\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nTolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in [[Middle-earth]], one who \"seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a [[Magic (Middle-earth)#Magic items|staff]]\".<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> Yet the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[C\u00edrdan]] who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him \"the greatest spirit and the wisest\" and gave him the Elven [[Three Rings|Ring of Power]] called [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, containing a \"red\" stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] later in the same essay:<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n{{blockquote|Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of [[Sauron]], opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly; but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was called among [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] of the North Gandalf 'the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] of the Wand'. For they deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire; and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>}}\n\n==Internal biography==\n\n===Valinor===\n\nIn [[Valinor]], Gandalf was called ''Ol\u00f3rin''.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/> He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, of the people of the Vala [[Manw\u00eb]]; and was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was also closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and [[Nienna]], the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards (Istari)]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] in order to counsel and assist all those who opposed [[Sauron]], Ol\u00f3rin was proposed by Manw\u00eb. Ol\u00f3rin initially begged to be excused as he feared Sauron and lacked the strength to face him, but Manw\u00eb replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 4, ch. 2, \"The Istari\"</ref>\n\nAs one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol\u00f3rin was in service to the Creator ([[Eru Il\u00favatar]]) and the Creator's '[[Secret Fire]]'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into the world as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an aged old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their own, and hopefully the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n===Middle-earth===\n\nThe Istari arrived in [[Middle-earth]] separately, early in the [[Third Age]]; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but [[C\u00edrdan]] the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire. [[Saruman]], the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other [[ring-bearers]] at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C\u00edrdan, was the holder of the third of the [[Three Rings|Elven-rings]].<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], but only through counsel; it was forbidden to use force to dominate them\u2014an injunction that Saruman increasingly disregarded.<ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The White Council====\n\nGandalf suspected early on that the [[Sauron#The Necromancer of Dol Guldur|Necromancer of Dol Guldur]] was not a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] but Sauron himself. He went to [[Dol Guldur]]<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', Appendix B.</ref> to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him. The Necromancer returned to Dol Guldur with greater force,<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> and the White Council was formed in response.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> [[Galadriel]] had hoped Gandalf would lead the Council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''</ref><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returned to Dol Guldur \"at great peril\" and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron returned. The following year the White Council was summoned, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.<ref name=\"AppB\" group=T/> Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident effort to find the [[One Ring]] would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river [[Anduin]] to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But at this time, Saruman himself began actively seeking the Ring near the [[Gladden Fields]] where [[Isildur]] had been killed.<ref name=\"Of the Rings of Power\" group=T/><ref name=\"Istari\" group=T/>\n\n====The Quest of Erebor====\n\n\"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' elaborates upon the story behind ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and [[Thorin Oakenshield]], a [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-king in exile, in the inn of the ''Prancing Pony'' in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with [[Sauron]], and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If [[Rivendell]] were to be attacked, the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]] [[Smaug]] could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of [[Erebor]] from Smaug, and so the quest was born.<ref>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, 3, \"[[The Quest of Erebor]]\"</ref>\n\n===''The Hobbit''===\n\nGandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of ''The Hobbit''. He arranges for a tea party, to which he also invites the thirteen dwarves and thus arranges the traveling group central to the novel's narrative. To the quest, Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 1, \"An Unexpected Party\"</ref> On this quest Gandalf finds his sword, ''[[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Glamdring|Glamdring]]'', in a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|troll's]] treasure hoard.<ref>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 2, \"Roast Mutton\"</ref> Elrond informs them this sword was made in [[Gondolin]], a city where Elrond's father lived as a child before its destruction.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 3, \"A Short Rest\"</ref>\n\nAfter escaping from the [[Misty Mountains]] pursued by goblins and [[Warg (Middle-earth)|warg]]s, the party is carried to safety by the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]].<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 6, \"Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire\"</ref> Gandalf then persuades [[Beorn]] to house and provision the company for the trip through [[Mirkwood]]. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 7, \"Queer Lodgings\"</ref>\n\nHe turns up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of [[Esgaroth]] and the [[Mirkwood Elves]] will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 17, \"The Clouds Burst\"</ref> After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the [[One Ring]] to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood.<ref group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 19, \"The Last Stage\"</ref> Then the Council \"put forth its power\" and drives Sauron from [[Dol Guldur]].

During this period, he befriends [[Aragorn]] and first becomes suspicious of [[Saruman]]. He spends as much time as he can in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's \"eleventy-first\" (111th) birthday party, bringing many [[fireworks]] for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the Ring and disappears, Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for [[Rivendell]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\nOver the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He find some answers in Isildur's scroll, in the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also wants to question Gollum, who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, and often has the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeds in finding Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in [[Barad-d\u00fbr]] to tell what he knows of the ring. This reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nReturning to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]], Gandalf confirms his suspicions by throwing [[One Ring|the Ring]] into [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the Ring, and urges him to take it to [[Rivendell]], for he will be in grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of [[Sauron]] will be searching for him.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nOutside the Shire, Gandalf encounters [[Radagast the Brown]], another wizard, who brings the news that the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] have ridden forth out of Mordor\u2014and a request from [[Saruman]] that Gandalf come to [[Isengard]]. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at an inn in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], and heads towards Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Eagle]].<ref name=\"The Council of Elrond\" group=T/>\n\nGwaihir sets Gandalf down in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], where Gandalf appeals to King [[Th\u00e9oden]] for a horse. Th\u00e9oden, under the evil influence of [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]], Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, one of the ''mearas'', who will be his mount and companion for much of the Lord of the Rings. Gandalf then rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until Frodo has already set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with [[Aragorn]].

Reiner got Crystal to accept the part by saying, \"How would you like to play Mel Brooks?\" Reiner also allowed Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, \"Have fun storming the castle!\" is a frequently-quoted line.\n\nReiner directed Crystal for a third time in the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), in which Crystal starred alongside [[Meg Ryan]] and for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. The film has since become an iconic classic for the genre and is Crystal's most celebrated film. Crystal then starred in the award-winning buddy comedy ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991), which proved very successful both commercially and critically and for which Crystal was nominated for his second [[Golden Globe]].

Crystal had another success alongside [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Harold Ramis]]' mobster comedy ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999).

Reiner got Crystal to accept the part by saying, \"How would you like to play Mel Brooks?\" Reiner also allowed Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, \"Have fun storming the castle!\" is a frequently-quoted line.\n\nReiner directed Crystal for a third time in the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), in which Crystal starred alongside [[Meg Ryan]] and for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]].

Crystal had another success alongside [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Harold Ramis]]' mobster comedy ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999).
