Ando chose the former in order to keep his ancestral properties in Taiwan (since all Japanese nationals had to forfeit their properties in Taiwan). However, Ando remained in Japan.\n\nAndo was convicted of tax evasion in 1948 and served two years in jail. In his biography, Ando said he had provided scholarships for students, which at the time was a form of tax evasion. After he lost his company due to a chain-reaction bankruptcy, Ando founded what was to become Nissin in [[Ikeda, Osaka|Ikeda]], [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]], Japan, starting off as a small family-run company producing salt.\n\n===Invention of Chicken Ramen===\n{{See also|Chicken Ramen}}\n[[File:Andos Workshop.JPG|thumb|270px|A recreation of Ando's Workshop at the Momofuku And\u014d Instant Ramen Museum.]]\n\nWith Japan still suffering from a shortage of food in the [[Occupation of Japan|post-war era]], the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|Ministry of Health]] tried to encourage people to eat [[bread]] made from [[wheat]] [[flour]] that was supplied by the United States. Ando wondered why bread was recommended instead of noodles, which were more familiar to the Japanese. The Ministry's response was that noodle companies were too small and unstable to satisfy supply needs, so Ando decided to develop the production of noodles by himself. The experience convinced him that \"Peace will come to the world when the people have enough to eat.\"<ref name=\"Japan Times\">{{cite news |date=2007-01-07 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070107a2.html |title=Ando was king of instant ramen |publisher=Japan Times |agency=Kyodo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519010856/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070107a2.html |archivedate=2007-05-19}}</ref>\n\nOn August 25, 1958, at the age of 48, and after months of [[trial and error]] experimentation to perfect his flash-frying method, Ando marketed the first package of precooked [[instant noodle]]s.

He had observed that Americans ate noodles by breaking the noodles in half, putting them into a paper cup, and pouring hot water over the noodles. They also ate them with a fork instead of chopsticks. Ando was inspired, and felt that a [[Styrofoam]] cup\u2014with a narrower bottom than the top\u2014would be the ideal vessel for holding noodles and keeping them warm. Eating the noodles would then be as easy as opening the lid, adding hot water and waiting. This simplicity, efficiency and low price of Cup Noodles went on to transform Nissin's fortunes.<ref name=\"Financial Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8bbeb216-a443-11db-bec4-0000779e2340.html|date=2007-01-15|title= Obituary: Momofuku Ando|publisher=Financial Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222120035/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8bbeb216-a443-11db-bec4-0000779e2340.html |archivedate=2007-02-22}}</ref>\n\nAndo began the sales of his most famous product, {{nihongo4|Cup Noodle|\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb|Kappu N\u016bdoru}}, on September 18, 1971, with the idea of providing a waterproof polystyrene container.<ref name=\"BBC News Asia-Pacific\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6406001.stm|title= Space-age funeral for 'Mr Noodle' | work=BBC News | date=February 28, 2007 | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}</ref> As prices dropped, instant [[ramen]] soon became a booming business.

This invention was proposed by the master of food agency. He wanted someone to invent \"Manufactured food of rice which you just pour in the water.\" Politicians and people who worked in the Food agency ate samples of the first batch of Cup Rice. Their evaluations were very high. In addition, mass communications reported that it was a \"miraculous food\", and they wrote \"Deliverer thing that people who make rice.\" However, Cup Rice\u2019s catalog price was quite high, compared to cup noodles because the price of rice was more expensive than wheat. Eventually, customers stopped buying Cup Rice because of its cost. So, Ando had to stop selling it. By the time he stopped selling, he had already spent 3 billion yen to build a factory for Cup Rice. It was twice as much as the capital fund. In addition, it was almost the same as sales in one year. At that point, Ando was filled with determination to lose it. According to this book,[https://iss.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000096-I009315427-00] named \"\u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u767a\u660e\u7269\u8a9e\"(It was written in Japanese.) Andou wrote this comment about his experience, \"There is a trap in compliments.\"\n\n==Industry memberships==\nIn 1964, seeking a way to promote the instant noodle industry, Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association, which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality, introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging and the \"fill to\" line. He was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers' Association.\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n[[File:Silver statue of Momofuku Ando 20120315.jpg|thumb|Silver statue of Momofuku Ando]]\nIn 1966, Ando naturalized through marriage and became a Japanese citizen. \"Momofuku\" is the Japanese reading of his Taiwanese given name ({{zh|c=\u767e\u798f|poj=Pek-hok|labels=no}}), while {{nihongo4||{{linktext|\u5b89\u85e4}}|And\u014d}} is the last name of his Japanese wife.\n\nAndo died of [[heart failure]] on January 5, 2007, at a hospital in [[Ikeda, Osaka|Ikeda]], [[Osaka Prefecture]], at the age of 96.<ref name=\"Japan Times\" />\n\nAndo was survived by his wife Masako, two sons and a daughter.

Ando chose the former in order to keep his ancestral properties in Taiwan (since all Japanese nationals had to forfeit their properties in Taiwan). However, Ando remained in Japan.\n\nAndo was convicted of tax evasion in 1948 and served two years in jail. In his biography, Ando said he had provided scholarships for students, which at the time was a form of tax evasion. After he lost his company due to a chain-reaction bankruptcy, Ando founded what was to become Nissin in [[Ikeda, Osaka|Ikeda]], [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]], Japan, starting off as a small family-run company producing salt.\n\n===Invention of Chicken Ramen===\n{{See also|Chicken Ramen}}\n[[File:Andos Workshop.JPG|thumb|270px|A recreation of Ando's Workshop at the Momofuku And\u014d Instant Ramen Museum.]]\n\nWith Japan still suffering from a shortage of food in the [[Occupation of Japan|post-war era]], the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|Ministry of Health]] tried to encourage people to eat [[bread]] made from [[wheat]] [[flour]] that was supplied by the United States. Ando wondered why bread was recommended instead of noodles, which were more familiar to the Japanese. The Ministry's response was that noodle companies were too small and unstable to satisfy supply needs, so Ando decided to develop the production of noodles by himself. The experience convinced him that \"Peace will come to the world when the people have enough to eat.\"<ref name=\"Japan Times\">{{cite news |date=2007-01-07 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070107a2.html |title=Ando was king of instant ramen |publisher=Japan Times |agency=Kyodo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519010856/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070107a2.html |archivedate=2007-05-19}}</ref>\n\nOn August 25, 1958, at the age of 48, and after months of [[trial and error]] experimentation to perfect his flash-frying method, Ando marketed the first package of precooked [[instant noodle]]s.

He had observed that Americans ate noodles by breaking the noodles in half, putting them into a paper cup, and pouring hot water over the noodles. They also ate them with a fork instead of chopsticks. Ando was inspired, and felt that a [[Styrofoam]] cup\u2014with a narrower bottom than the top\u2014would be the ideal vessel for holding noodles and keeping them warm. Eating the noodles would then be as easy as opening the lid, adding hot water and waiting. This simplicity, efficiency and low price of Cup Noodles went on to transform Nissin's fortunes.<ref name=\"Financial Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8bbeb216-a443-11db-bec4-0000779e2340.html|date=2007-01-15|title= Obituary: Momofuku Ando|publisher=Financial Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222120035/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/8bbeb216-a443-11db-bec4-0000779e2340.html |archivedate=2007-02-22}}</ref>\n\nAndo began the sales of his most famous product, {{nihongo4|Cup Noodle|\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb|Kappu N\u016bdoru}}, on September 18, 1971, with the idea of providing a waterproof polystyrene container.<ref name=\"BBC News Asia-Pacific\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6406001.stm|title= Space-age funeral for 'Mr Noodle' | work=BBC News | date=February 28, 2007 | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}</ref> As prices dropped, instant [[ramen]] soon became a booming business.

This invention was proposed by the master of food agency. He wanted someone to invent \"Manufactured food of rice which you just pour in the water.\" Politicians and people who worked in the Food agency ate samples of the first batch of Cup Rice. Their evaluations were very high. In addition, mass communications reported that it was a \"miraculous food\", and they wrote \"Deliverer thing that people who make rice.\" However, Cup Rice\u2019s catalog price was quite high, compared to cup noodles because the price of rice was more expensive than wheat. Eventually, customers stopped buying Cup Rice because of its cost. So, Ando had to stop selling Cup Rice. By the time he stopped selling, he had already spent 3 billion yen to build a factory for Cup Rice. It was two times as much as the capital fund. In addition, it was almost the same as sales in one year. At that point, Ando was filled with determination to lose it. According to this book,[https://iss.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000096-I009315427-00] named \"\u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3\u767a\u660e\u7269\u8a9e\"(It was written in Japanese.) Andou wrote this comment about his experience \"There is a trap in compliments.\"\n\n==Industry memberships==\nIn 1964, seeking a way to promote the instant noodle industry, Ando founded the Instant Food Industry Association, which set guidelines for fair competition and product quality, introducing several industry standards such as the inclusion of production dates on packaging and the \"fill to\" line. He was also the chairman of the International Ramen Manufacturers' Association.\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n[[File:Silver statue of Momofuku Ando 20120315.jpg|thumb|Silver statue of Momofuku Ando]]\nIn 1966, Ando naturalized through marriage and became a Japanese citizen. \"Momofuku\" is the Japanese reading of his Taiwanese given name ({{zh|c=\u767e\u798f|poj=Pek-hok|labels=no}}), while {{nihongo4||{{linktext|\u5b89\u85e4}}|And\u014d}} is the last name of his Japanese wife.\n\nAndo died of [[heart failure]] on January 5, 2007, at a hospital in [[Ikeda, Osaka|Ikeda]], [[Osaka Prefecture]], at the age of 96.<ref name=\"Japan Times\" />\n\nAndo was survived by his wife Masako, two sons and a daughter.
