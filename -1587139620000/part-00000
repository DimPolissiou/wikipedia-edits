On November 2, 1753, she married the family's tutor, William Darragh, the son of a clergyman. A few years later, they immigrated to Philadelphia, where William worked as a tutor and Lydia as a midwife. She gave birth to five children: Charles (born 1755), Ann (born 1757), John (born 1763), William (born 1766), Susannah (born 1768), and four others who died in infancy. Lydia Barrington was not well educated because her parents did not have enough money for her ass education a bad one .<!-- Didn't she marry a tutor? -->\n\n==American Revolutionary War==\nAs Quakers, the Darraghs were [[pacifist]]s. However, their oldest son Charles served with the [[2nd Pennsylvania Regiment]] of the Continental Army.\n\nLydia\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d is saving Washington\u2019s army from an ambush at Whitemarsh in December 1777.  The story was first published in 1827, and was later elaborated on. In 1777 the British were occupying Philadelphia. Lydia Darragh\u2019s house happened to be across the street from General William Howe\u2019s headquarters, and the night of December 2nd, 1777 British officers commandeered one of her rooms for a secret conference. Lydia eavesdropped on their meeting, learning of their plan to go after Washington\u2019s army at Whitemarsh. On December 4, she requested and received a pass to leave the city to go Frankford Mill to buy flour. Once she was outside the city, she made her way toward the Continental army at Whitemarsh. On the road, she met a friend who happened to be Colonel Thomas Craig from Washington\u2019s army. Lydia passed the information of the impending British attack through him, got her flour, and headed back to Philadelphia. That night the British marched on Whitemarsh- instead of the ambush they had planned, the Continental army was at arms and ready. General Howe was forced to return to Philadelphia.[http://www.britannica.com/biography/Lydia-Barrington-Darragh]\n\nOn September 26, 1777, British troops occupied Philadelphia.  [[General William Howe]] moved across the street from the Darraghs, in a house formerly belonging to [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]].<ref>Bohrer, Melissa Lukeman.

Lydia told them that they had already sent away their two youngest children to live with relatives in another city, but that they had nowhere else to go and would like to stay in their home. She protested and went straight to Howe's residence (Cadwalader House) across the street from her home ([[Benjamin Loxley house|Loxley House]]). Prior to her meeting Howe, a British officer introduced himself as Captain William Barrington of the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers). She was immediately taken aback by his Irish brogue and his name Barrington, which was her maiden name. He told her that he was from Dublin and in the course of the conversation, she discovered that he was her second cousin. She explained to him the situation and he stated that he would take up her case with Howe immediately. They both walked into the residence and were taken in to see Howe who agreed to let her stay but that he and his staff would use the large house parlor for staff meetings. They were permitted to remain, as Quakers were known to be unsupportive of the war, even on the side of the colonies, and therefore posed no apparent risk to the British army.<ref>Bohrer, Melissa Lukeman. Glory, Passion, and Principle: The Story of Eight Remarkable Women at the Core of the American Revolution. (New York: Atria Books, 2003),128.</ref>\n\nOn December 2, 1777, Lydia received a request that she and her family retire early, by 8 o'clock. She was told that she would be awakened when the soldiers were finished so she could let them out.  Lydia pretended to go to sleep, but instead listened to the soldiers through the door. She learned that British troops were being ordered to leave the city on December 4 to make a surprise attack on the [[Continental army]] camped at [[Battle of White Marsh|White Marsh]], led by George Washington.  Lydia sneaked back to bed and pretended to be asleep until the officer, Major [[John Andr\u00e9]], knocked three times at her door to awaken her to follow them out and extinguish the candles.\n\nLydia decided not to share this information with her husband. The following morning she was given permission by General Howe to cross British lines in order to go to [[Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Frankford]] to get flour.  Lydia dropped off her empty bag at the mill and then headed toward the American camp. Along the way she met an American officer, Colonel Craig of the [[First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry|Light Horse]], and told him about the impending British attack so that he might warn Washington. After the warning, Lydia made her way back to the mill, picked up her flour and started her journey home. After the British troops attempted their attack and realized that the Americans were waiting for them, the officer questioned Lydia and asked if anyone was awake on the night of the meeting, because it was obvious that someone had betrayed them. Lydia denied any knowledge of this and was not further questioned. A quote from the officer who questioned Lydia: \"We were betrayed, for, on arriving near the encampment of General Washington, we found his cannon mounted, his troops under arms and so prepared at every point to receive us that we were compelled to march back, without injuring our enemy, like a parcel of fools.\"<ref>Lincoln Diamant, ed., ''Revolutionary Women in the War for American Independence'' (Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998), 113-115.</ref>\n\n==First Hand Account==\n<blockquote>In the Autumn of 1777 the American Army lay some time at White Marsh. I was then Commissary Gen l of Prisoners, and managed the Intelligence of the Army. \u2014 I was reconoitering along the Lines near the City of Philadelphia. \u2014 I dined at a small Post at the rising Sun about three miles from the City. \u2014 After Dinner a little poor looking insignificant Old Woman came in & solicited leave to go into the Country to buy some flour \u2014 While we were asking some Questions, she walked up to me and put into my hands a dirty old needle book, with various small pockets in it. surprised at this, I told her to return, she should have an answer \u2014 On Opening the needlebook, I could not find any thing till I got to the last Pocket, Where I found a piece of Paper rolled up into the form of a Pipe Shank. \u2014 on unrolling it I found information that General Howe was coming out the next morning with 5000 Men \u2014 13 pieces of Cannon \u2014 Baggage Waggons, and 11 Boats on Waggon Wheels. On comparing this with other information I found it true, and immediately rode Post to head Quarters \u2014<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/journalorhistori00boud#page/50/ ''Journal or Historical Recollections of American Events During the Revolutionary War''].</ref></blockquote>A [[contemporary]] account of Lydia Darrah highlights several [[grist mills]] on the [[Frankford Creek]]; also a tavern named the Rising Sun next to Frankford's main grist mill. This was not the same Rising Sun Tavern mentioned in Boudinot's Journal.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160315234910/http://frankfordgazette.com/wp1/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Frankford-Chronicles-Lydia-Darragh.Fi%C3%B1usFi-%C3%B1us.pdf \u201cFrankford Chronicles Agent Lydia Darragh - Intelligence Operative\u201d].</ref>\n\n[[British Intelligence]] agents became aware of the \"bag of flour\" trick a bit too late. On December 6, 1777, after the British returned from [[Battle of White Marsh|Whitemarsh]], a message was published in the Philadelphia newspaper about \"a poor woman, whom we both know\" traveling to the Frankford Mill:\n\n<blockquote>The following letter was found in a bag of Indian meal, which was picked up on Saturday the fourteenth of last month, was supposed to have been dropped by some of the women who were coming into town, when the skirmish happened between the pickets.<ref>Menkevich, Joseph J. Frankford Chronicles Agent Lydia Darragh - Intelligence Operative, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (self-published, 2012), 5</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Later life==\nIn June 1778, British troops left Philadelphia, and Darragh's children returned to their family home. William Darrgah died on June 8, 1783. Charles lost his membership to the Society of Friends on April 27, 1781. Lydia lost her membership on August 29, 1783. In 1786, Lydia and the children moved into a new house, and she ran a store until her death on December 28, 1789. They are both buried in the Quakers' burying ground at Fourth and Arch Streets, not far from their home.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2013 the National Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] created the Lydia Darragh Medal. The Lydia Darragh Medal may be awarded by the incumbent President General, Vice President General, State Society President or Chapter President to the lady who has provided significant service to him during his term of office.

They both walked into the residence and were taken in to see Howe who agreed to let her stay but that he and his staff would use the large house parlor for staff meetings. They were permitted to remain, as Quakers were known to be unsupportive of the war, even on the side of the colonies, and therefore posed no apparent risk to the British army.<ref>Bohrer, Melissa Lukeman.

She was told that she would be awakened when the soldiers were finished so she could let them out.  Lydia pretended to go to sleep, but instead listened to the soldiers through the door. She learned that British troops were being ordered to leave the city on December 4 to make a surprise attack on the [[Continental army]] camped at [[Battle of White Marsh|White Marsh]], led by George Washington.  Lydia sneaked back to bed and pretended to be asleep until the officer, Major [[John Andr\u00e9]], knocked three times at her door to awaken her to follow them out and extinguish the candles.\n\nLydia decided not to share this information with her husband. The following morning she was given permission by General Howe to cross British lines in order to go to [[Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Frankford]] to get flour.  Lydia dropped off her empty bag at the mill and then headed toward the American camp. Along the way she met an American officer, Colonel Craig of the [[First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry|Light Horse]], and told him about the impending British attack so that he might warn Washington. After the warning, Lydia made her way back to the mill, picked up her flour and started her journey home. After the British troops attempted their attack and realized that the Americans were waiting for them, the officer questioned Lydia and asked if anyone was awake on the night of the meeting, because it was obvious that someone had betrayed them. Lydia denied any knowledge of this and was not further questioned. A quote from the officer who questioned Lydia: \"We were betrayed, for, on arriving near the encampment of General Washington, we found his cannon mounted, his troops under arms and so prepared at every point to receive us that we were compelled to march back, without injuring our enemy, like a parcel of fools.\"<ref>Lincoln Diamant, ed., ''Revolutionary Women in the War for American Independence'' (Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998), 113-115.</ref>\n\n==First Hand Account==\n<blockquote>In the Autumn of 1777 the American Army lay some time at White Marsh.

William Darrgah died on June 8, 1783. Charles lost his membership to the Society of Friends on April 27, 1781. Lydia lost her membership on August 29, 1783. In 1786, Lydia and the children moved into a new house, and she ran a store until her death on December 28, 1789. They are both buried in the Quakers' burying ground at Fourth and Arch Streets, not far from their home.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2013 the National Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] created the Lydia Darragh Medal.

Generalized Linpan in Chengdu Plain refers to the Linpan Settlement system in the region of Chengdu Plain, also known as Linpan settlement. Moreover, LinPan in Chengdu Plain is representative of farming type in western Sichuan that combines production and daily life in one landscape. It is understood that the cores of Linpan in Chengdu plain are trees and bamboo, but the main features of this landscape are water, houses, and fields. It is usually inhabited by surname or clan as settlement units showing the layout in a decentralized manner and in the form of a typical natural village. Small-scale Linpan generally has only a few dozen peasant families, however large-scale Linpan may contain hundreds of households.\n\nLinpan in Chengdu Plain originated during the [[:zh:\u53e4\u8700\u6587\u660e|Ancient Shu Civilization]] and formed in a long period of immigration, which has been thousands of years history. It is not only reflected in the local farming culture but also is the crystallization of the traditional farming civilization era. The Linpan Settlement system coordinates with local farming conditions, traditional farming behavior and living life, and plays a crucial role in preserving the environment of Chengdu Plain.<ref name=\"Fan Yanzhi\">{{cite thesis |last=Fan |first=Yanzhi |date=2009 |title=\u5ddd\u897f\u6797\u76d8\u73af\u5883\u666f\u89c2\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76 |trans-title= |type=MSc |chapter= |publisher=Sichuan Agricultural University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10626-2009258597.htm |access-date=}}</ref> Furthermore, it has society, culture, aesthetic and ecology value and make the rural landscape of Chengdu Plain different from the other area of China.

Linpan is the key element that makes Chengdu rural landscape unique.<ref name=\"the rural landscape\" />\n\n==Features==\n\n===Culture===\nLinpan Settlement in Chengdu Plain inherited Chinese traditional farming culture and has a farming history for thousands of years, but it also has its own characteristics. [[Sichuan]] is a historic and typical region of traditional intensive farming culture in China, while the Chengdu Plain, is an important place of origin and development of this culture. Chengdu Plain provides the requisite conditions for the continuation and development of the farming culture, such as pleasant environmental conditions, warm and humid climate, abundant water and fertile land.\n\nIn the second place, Linpan in Chengdu Plain combines the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]], agricultural production, family system and lifestyle, that integrates the daily life in Chengdu Plain, production and ecological environment. It is a perfect combined spatial form of cultural symbol and use value. Linpan in Chengdu Plain formed as the basis of millennial Dujiangyan irrigation works, which solved the decisive factor, water, for the farming culture development. Formed a pattern of ecological farming, which regards the Dujiangyan irrigation system as its core, Chengdu plain as its hinterland and Longquan Range as its protective screen. The intensive Linpan Settlements fully reflect the farming culture which has the Sichuan water cultural characteristic.\n\n===Ecology===\nChengdu Plain irrigated by the Dujiangyan irrigation system is a semi-natural wetland ecosystem. It provides a habitat for birds, but also provides a food base and living space for human beings. The symbiosis of people and woods even more continues today. The mainly landscape elements in this living environment are fields, woods, farmhouse and water, and these four main elements are harmony and interdependence\uff1a\n\n*Pattern of woods-water, creates the integration of woods forest network and water network.\n*Pattern of woods-fields, shows high performance in biodiversity.\n*Pattern of woods-farm house, creates a pleasant microclimate.\nIn terms of vegetation other than crops,  the dominant plant type in Chengdu Plain is evergreen broad-leaved forest because Chengdu locates in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone. Affected by the same rainfall and heat pattern, Linpan demonstrates similar zonal characteristics in the natural distribution of plant community structure with some distinctive variations. In the Linpan landscape, the main vegetation types surrounding residential buildings are evergreen broad-leaved forests and bamboo stands with frequencies of 25% and 32%, respectively. In contrast to the overall high biodiversity of Linpan as a rural settlement, the vegetation around houses are rather uniform. In most farming Linpan, the plant structure is dominated by a single type of tree or bamboo such as Metasequoia or Cedar. The relatively mixed forests mostly exist in Linpan aiming at developing rural tourism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u5b59\u5927\u6c5f|last2=\u9648\u5176\u5175|last3=\u80e1\u5ead\u5174|last4=\u5218\u5149\u7acb|last5=\u5b59\u5927\u8fdc|last6=\u7f57\u542f\u9ad8|date=2011|title=\u5ddd\u897f\u6797\u76d8\u7fa4\u843d\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u6837\u6027|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/91109x/201101/37279682.html|journal=\u56db\u5ddd\u519c\u4e1a\u5927\u5b66\u5b66\u62a5|volume=29|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Form===\nThe whole Linpan settlement in Chengdu Plain that lies between the cities and towns as roads crisscross, coupled with the water-intensive.

The scale of the farm village in the Chengdu Plain is very small. The radius of the buildings, surrounding courtyards and [[bamboo]]s always within 30 meters. This kind of compact small village has a strong identifiable and easy for people to grasp farming activities.\n\nThe buildings in Linpan are generally typical one-story Western Sichuan folk residential buildings with a Galley or L-shape layout built by individual households respectively. Usually, 3-5 households form a small Linpan unit, and 20-30 households form a big Linpan unit, which is surrounded by tall trees and bamboos to shelter from the wind.\n\nOne of the most significant features of Linpan and almost all Western Sichuan folk housing is that the buildings always enclose a courtyard called \u201cBaba\u201d, and \u201cBaba\u201d is where most domestic and interactive activities happen. People dry crops, hang out washed clothes, talk and play [[Mahjong]] with neighbors, and even host family banquets (Baba Yan) in the \"Baba\" courtyards.\n\n== The Causes for the Formation of Linpan Culture ==\n\n=== Geographical and Environmental Conditions ===\nChengdu Plain is a relatively independent and complete geographic unit sitting in the western [[Sichuan Basin]]. The area of Chengdu Plain is about 9100 square kilometers in size and 450\u2013750 meters in altitude. Chengdu Plain is a river alluvial plain, and its fertile soil and large open flat land provide a firm foundation for farming development. In addition, the mild subtropical monsoon climate brings rich heat and abundant rainfall, making it suitable for human habitation and production. With the warm winter and the early spring, crops and bamboos can grow year-round. Another unique advantage of the Chengdu Plain is the well-developed irrigation system.  After the construction of [[Dujiangyan]], most farmlands achieved gravity irrigation. Along with ample surface and groundwater resources, the dispersed rural living pattern became possible.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-CDDB201105014.htm|title=On Causes for Formation of Linpan Culture in West Sichuan Plain--\u300aJournal of Chengdu University(Social Sciences)\u300b2011\u5e7405\u671f|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Economics and Production ===\nThe relatively stable climate and advanced water irrigation and management system in western Sichuan provide a powerful guarantee for the independent farming of individual households. In order to promote crop production, farmers choose to live scattered near their own land to devote more labor to intensive rice farming. In addition, the scattered pattern solves the shortcomings of long-distance transportation in the fields. Moreover, surplus manpower and large courtyards make it possible for farmers to supplement agricultural income by operating home textiles, bamboo basket weaving or raising livestock, and grow fruits and vegetables. With all these factors, the production of the Linpan gradually evolved into the current pattern.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Migration ===\nThere have been six large-scale migrations in history from other provinces to Sichuan province, creating the unique and inclusive culture of an immigrant society. Migrants promoted the social and economic development of the region in many ways and various customs they introduced created the compatible features of a new culture. During the migration process, bloodlines were broken and the concept of clans was diluted, so rather than being bind by kinships, people were more related by geography and production approximately. In the new settlements, people could be equal regardless of their origins, allowing the Linpan culture of a scattered living pattern to flourish.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Culture and Customs ===\nWestern Sichuan Plain is an important source of [[Taoism]]. Since the [[:zh:\u53e4\u8700\u6587\u660e|Ancient Shu Civilization]], people living in the region have valued nature and freedom over careers and regulations. Later generations of the Shu in the unique geographical and cultural environment also inherited the philosophy of prioritizing pleasure, leisure, and the freedom of life, which formed the social basis for Linpan culture. Another reason explaining the settlement pattern is the tradition of living separately in single-family homes, instead of large unified homes with parents and relatives. By splitting up into smaller units, there are more initiative and flexibility for households to live and produce.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Distribution of Linpan==\nLinpan Settlement mainly distributed in the Chengdu Plain, however, Chengdu Plain belongs to the Sichuan Basin. [[Sichuan Basin]] is one of the famous big basins in China, whose terrain is relatively inaccessible. It is surrounded by 1000\u20132000 meters above sea level mountain, one of the few mountains up to an altitude of 3000\u20134000 meters. Basin covers an area of about 170,000 square kilometers, mostly in elevation between 300\u2013700 meters.\n\nThe Chengdu Plain covers an area of about 23,000 square kilometers and is the largest plain in southwestern China. It lies on the marginal region of the Sichuan Basin and rivers from the high mountains to the north and west brings soil and water supply to the vast land.<ref name=\"GO CD\">{{cite web|title=What makes Chengdu the Land of Abundance|url=http://www.gochengdu.cn/culture/city-profile/what-makes-chengdu-the-land-of-abundance-a593.html|website=GO CHENGDU|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> The Chengdu Plain located among Longquan range, [[Longmen Mountains]] and [[Qionglai Mountains]].<ref name=\"Linpan book\" /> The great [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang River]], together with its tributaries, runs across the Chengdu Plain to form an expansive water network.<ref name=\"GO CD\" /> Because the formation of factors, Linpan mainly distributed in flat terrain area, that the most typical ones are in the Chengdu Plain. In addition to Sichuan in China's western provinces of [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]] and other places also have distribution.\n\nThe typical Linpan Settlements mainly distributed in 14 districts(cities) of Chengdu Plain are [[Longquanyi District]], [[Pi County]], [[Wenjiang District]], [[Shuangliu District]], [[Xindu District]], [[Qingbaijiang District]], [[Dayi County]], [[Xinjin County]], [[Jintang County]], [[Pujiang County, Sichuan|Pujiang County]], [[Dujiangyan City]], [[Pengzhou]], [[Chongzhou|Chongzhou City]], [[Qionglai City]], covers an area of 11,711 square kilometers.

The vegetation and buildings in this kind of Linpan Settlement should harmonize with the fields, and it is the ecological residence of the rural population who engaged in agricultural activities. It is also a typical vector, which is the symbiosis of people, fields, buildings, woods, and water. There are some unique spatial features of the farming Linpan, which provide spaces for drying cereals and corn, stacking farming tools, intensively-reared livestock, etc. These characteristics are reflected in this kind of Linpan settlement farming as the main mode of industrial structure.\n[[File:Farmhouse in Chengdu Plain.jpg|thumb|right|A farmhouse in Chengdu Plain.|245x245px]]\n\n===Ecological Type===\nWith the change of time, social development, improvement of living standards and the progress of rural-urban integration, at the same time Linpan also changing. The villagers no longer satisfied with living a life of self-sufficient farming, have moved to the urban area from Linpan Settlement, which has caused some empty Linpan Settlements. The role of these \"Empty Linpan\" is no longer for living, but has transformed to the ecological Linpan which has an ecological function for preserving the local environment.\n\n===Rural Tourism Type===\nAt present, the rapid population growth led to urban sprawl and dwindling agricultural land resources. Rural tourism as a compound of agricultural production and economic activities has become more and more popular. Thus, the Rural Tourism type of Linpan emerged in the Chengdu Plain. This type of Linpan mostly located in suburban areas, relying on agricultural production and make full use of the environment and transport advantages to develop rural inn and farmhouse catering services. It not only can satisfy local people's production and living needs, but also provide a tourism and vacation place for urban residents.\n\n===Specific Industrial Type===\nThe main function of agricultural and forest land in specific industrial Linpan is production. Generally, the requirements of landscape aesthetics are less than the other types of Linpan. This type of Linpan creates multiple agricultural eco-landscape. This kind of Linpan makes use of the traditional specific industry and enhances it, such as anti-season greenhouse vegetables and fruits, courtyard economy, livestock raising, and other specific industries.\n\n==The Threaten of Linpan in Chengdu Plain==\nWith the implementation of changes in land-use policies and urban-rural integration in China, most households are grouped together as a group-type settlement during the new rural construction. The original distribution of Linpan formula has been greatly affected by the construction practices of farmers and the government, and the distance between farmers and land is also pulled away. Many factors can cause the number of Linpan Settlement to dwindle. On one hand, many Linpan Settlements were removed or merged into a larger one. On the other hand, with the increasing number of part of the Linpan dwellers drift into cities, many Linpan Settlements are lack of management and change to be \u201cHollow Linpan\u201d. All of these lead the number of Linpan Settlement decreasing each year. [[Pi County]], a country near Chengdu, had more than 11,000 Linpan Settlement while there only has 8,000 now.

Generalized Linpan in Chengdu Plain refers to the Linpan Settlement system in the region of Chengdu Plain, also known as Linpan settlement. Moreover, LinPan in Chengdu Plain is representative of farming type in western Sichuan that combines production and daily life in one landscape. It is understood that the cores of Linpan in Chengdu plain are trees and bamboo, but the main features of this landscape are water, houses, and fields. It is usually inhabited by surname or clan as settlement units showing the layout in a decentralized manner and in the form of a typical natural village. Small-scale Linpan generally has only a few dozen peasant families, however large-scale Linpan may contain hundreds of households.\n\nLinpan in Chengdu Plain originated during the [[:zh:\u53e4\u8700\u6587\u660e|Ancient Shu Civilization]] and formed in a long period of immigration, which has been thousands of years history. It is not only reflected in the local farming culture but also is the crystallization of the traditional farming civilization era. The Linpan Settlement system coordinates with local farming conditions, traditional farming behavior and living life, and plays a crucial role in preserving the environment of Chengdu Plain.<ref name=\"Fan Yanzhi\">{{cite thesis |last=Fan |first=Yanzhi |date=2009 |title=\u5ddd\u897f\u6797\u76d8\u73af\u5883\u666f\u89c2\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76 |trans-title= |type=MSc |chapter= |publisher=Sichuan Agricultural University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10626-2009258597.htm |access-date=}}</ref> Furthermore, it has society, culture, aesthetic and ecology value and make the rural landscape of Chengdu Plain different from the other area of China.

Linpan is the key element that makes Chengdu rural landscape unique.<ref name=\"the rural landscape\" />\n\n==Features==\n\n===Culture===\nLinpan Settlement in Chengdu Plain inherited Chinese traditional farming culture and has a farming history for thousands of years, but it also has its own characteristics. [[Sichuan]] is a historic and typical region of traditional intensive farming culture in China, while the Chengdu Plain, is an important place of origin and development of this culture. Chengdu Plain provides the requisite conditions for the continuation and development of the farming culture, such as pleasant environmental conditions, warm and humid climate, abundant water and fertile land.\n\nIn the second place, Linpan in Chengdu Plain combines the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]], agricultural production, family system and lifestyle, that integrates the daily life in Chengdu Plain, production and ecological environment. It is a perfect combined spatial form of cultural symbol and use value. Linpan in Chengdu Plain formed as the basis of millennial Dujiangyan irrigation works, which solved the decisive factor, water, for the farming culture development. Formed a pattern of ecological farming, which regards the Dujiangyan irrigation system as its core, Chengdu plain as its hinterland and Longquan Range as its protective screen. The intensive Linpan Settlements fully reflect the farming culture which has the Sichuan water cultural characteristic.\n\n===Ecology===\nChengdu Plain irrigated by the Dujiangyan irrigation system is a semi-natural wetland ecosystem. It provides a habitat for birds, but also provides a food base and living space for human beings. The symbiosis of people and woods even more continues today. The mainly landscape elements in this living environment are fields, woods, farmhouse and water, and these four main elements are harmony and interdependence\uff1a\n\n*Pattern of woods-water, creates the integration of woods forest network and water network.\n*Pattern of woods-fields, shows high performance in biodiversity.\n*Pattern of woods-farm house, creates a pleasant microclimate.\nIn terms of vegetation other than crops,  the dominant plant type in Chengdu Plain is evergreen broad-leaved forest because Chengdu locates in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone. Affected by the same rainfall and heat pattern, Linpan demonstrates similar zonal characteristics in the natural distribution of plant community structure with some distinctive variations. In the Linpan landscape, the main vegetation types surrounding residential buildings are evergreen broad-leaved forests and bamboo stands with frequencies of 25% and 32%, respectively. In contrast to the overall high biodiversity of Linpan as a rural settlement, the vegetation around houses are rather uniform. In most farming Linpan, the plant structure is dominated by a single type of tree or bamboo such as Metasequoia or Cedar. The relatively mixed forests mostly exist in Linpan aiming at developing rural tourism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u5b59\u5927\u6c5f|last2=\u9648\u5176\u5175|last3=\u80e1\u5ead\u5174|last4=\u5218\u5149\u7acb|last5=\u5b59\u5927\u8fdc|last6=\u7f57\u542f\u9ad8|date=2011|title=\u5ddd\u897f\u6797\u76d8\u7fa4\u843d\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u591a\u6837\u6027|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/91109x/201101/37279682.html|journal=\u56db\u5ddd\u519c\u4e1a\u5927\u5b66\u5b66\u62a5|volume=29|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Form===\nThe whole Linpan settlement in Chengdu Plain that lies between the cities and towns as roads crisscross, coupled with the water-intensive. It is in space to form a \"checkerboard\" pattern, such a network, which distributed a number of scattered Linpan landscape units.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Zhao |first=Rongming |date=2006 |title=\u6210\u90fd\u57ce\u5e02\u8fb9\u7f18\u533a\u4e61\u6751\u805a\u843d\u89c4\u5212\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7b56\u7814\u7a76 |trans-title= |type=MSc |chapter= |publisher=Southwest Jiaotong University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/Thesis/Y1019960 |access-date=}}</ref> Linpan Settlement generally based on single-family or family group as a unit, scattered among the field.\n\nIn terms of shape, it is characterized by small-scale and recognizability. The scale of the farm village in the Chengdu Plain is very small. The radius of the buildings, surrounding courtyards and [[bamboo]]s always within 30 meters. This kind of compact small village has a strong identifiable and easy for people to grasp farming activities.\n\nThe buildings in Linpan are generally typical one-story Western Sichuan folk residential buildings with a Galley or L-shape layout built by individual households respectively. Usually, 3-5 households form a small Linpan unit, and 20-30 households form a big Linpan unit, which is surrounded by tall trees and bamboos to shelter from the wind.\n\nOne of the most significant features of Linpan and almost all Western Sichuan folk housing is that the buildings always enclose a courtyard called \u201cBaba\u201d, and \u201cBaba\u201d is where most domestic and interactive activities happen. People dry crops, hang out washed clothes, talk and play [[Mahjong]] with neighbors, and even host family banquets (Baba Yan) in the \"Baba\" courtyards.\n\n== The Causes for the Formation of Linpan Culture ==\n\n=== Geographical and Environmental Conditions ===\nChengdu Plain is a relatively independent and complete geographic unit sitting in the western [[Sichuan Basin]]. The area of Chengdu Plain is about 9100 square kilometers in size and 450\u2013750 meters in altitude. Chengdu Plain is a river alluvial plain, and its fertile soil and large open flat land provide a firm foundation for farming development. In addition, the mild subtropical monsoon climate brings rich heat and abundant rainfall, making it suitable for human habitation and production. With the warm winter and the early spring, crops and bamboos can grow year-round. Another unique advantage of the Chengdu Plain is the well-developed irrigation system.  After the construction of [[Dujiangyan]], most farmlands achieved gravity irrigation. Along with ample surface and groundwater resources, the dispersed rural living pattern became possible.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-CDDB201105014.htm|title=On Causes for Formation of Linpan Culture in West Sichuan Plain--\u300aJournal of Chengdu University(Social Sciences)\u300b2011\u5e7405\u671f|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Economics and Production ===\nThe relatively stable climate and advanced water irrigation and management system in western Sichuan provide a powerful guarantee for the independent farming of individual households. In order to promote crop production, farmers choose to live scattered near their own land to devote more labor to intensive rice farming. In addition, the scattered pattern solves the shortcomings of long-distance transportation in the fields. Moreover, surplus manpower and large courtyards make it possible for farmers to supplement agricultural income by operating home textiles, bamboo basket weaving or raising livestock, and grow fruits and vegetables. With all these factors, the production of the Linpan gradually evolved into the current pattern.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Migration ===\nThere have been six large-scale migrations in history from other provinces to Sichuan province, creating the unique and inclusive culture of an immigrant society. Migrants promoted the social and economic development of the region in many ways and various customs they introduced created the compatible features of a new culture. During the migration process, bloodlines were broken and the concept of clans was diluted, so rather than being bind by kinships, people were more related by geography and production approximately. In the new settlements, people could be equal regardless of their origins, allowing the Linpan culture of a scattered living pattern to flourish.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Culture and Customs ===\nWestern Sichuan Plain is an important source of [[Taoism]]. Since the [[:zh:\u53e4\u8700\u6587\u660e|Ancient Shu Civilization]], people living in the region have valued nature and freedom over careers and regulations. Later generations of the Shu in the unique geographical and cultural environment also inherited the philosophy of prioritizing pleasure, leisure, and the freedom of life, which formed the social basis for Linpan culture. Another reason explaining the settlement pattern is the tradition of living separately in single-family homes, instead of large unified homes with parents and relatives. By splitting up into smaller units, there are more initiative and flexibility for households to live and produce.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Distribution of Linpan==\nLinpan Settlement mainly distributed in the Chengdu Plain, however, Chengdu Plain belongs to the Sichuan Basin. [[Sichuan Basin]] is one of the famous big basins in China, whose terrain is relatively inaccessible. It is surrounded by 1000\u20132000 meters above sea level mountain, one of the few mountains up to an altitude of 3000\u20134000 meters. Basin covers an area of about 170,000 square kilometers, mostly in elevation between 300\u2013700 meters.\n\nThe Chengdu Plain covers an area of about 23,000 square kilometers and is the largest plain in southwestern China. It lies on the marginal region of the Sichuan Basin and rivers from the high mountains to the north and west brings soil and water supply to the vast land.<ref name=\"GO CD\">{{cite web|title=What makes Chengdu the Land of Abundance|url=http://www.gochengdu.cn/culture/city-profile/what-makes-chengdu-the-land-of-abundance-a593.html|website=GO CHENGDU|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> The Chengdu Plain located among Longquan range, [[Longmen Mountains]] and [[Qionglai Mountains]].<ref name=\"Linpan book\" /> The great [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang River]], together with its tributaries, runs across the Chengdu Plain to form an expansive water network.<ref name=\"GO CD\" /> Because the formation of factors, Linpan mainly distributed in flat terrain area, that the most typical ones are in the Chengdu Plain. In addition to Sichuan in China's western provinces of [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]] and other places also have distribution.\n\nThe typical Linpan Settlements mainly distributed in 14 districts(cities) of Chengdu Plain are [[Longquanyi District]], [[Pi County]], [[Wenjiang District]], [[Shuangliu District]], [[Xindu District]], [[Qingbaijiang District]], [[Dayi County]], [[Xinjin County]], [[Jintang County]], [[Pujiang County, Sichuan|Pujiang County]], [[Dujiangyan City]], [[Pengzhou]], [[Chongzhou|Chongzhou City]], [[Qionglai City]], covers an area of 11,711 square kilometers.

The number of existing Linpan is around 141,100, with a total area of 67,679.87 hectares. The resident population of Linpan in Chengdu is about 449.03 million, accounting for 41.50% of the total population of the city region and 77.09% of the city total rural population.<ref name=\"jianwei\">{{cite journal|last1=Chengdu|first1=Urban and Rural Construction Commission|title=\u6210\u90fd\u7f16\u5236\u89c4\u5212\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ddd\u897f\u6797\u76d8\u98ce\u8c8c|journal=Urban Planning Newsreport|date=2007|volume=17|pages=8\u20139|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-CSGT200717010.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Types of Linpan Settlement==\n\n===Farming Type===\nThis type of Linpan settlement mainly focuses on agricultural production. The vegetation and buildings in this kind of Linpan Settlement should harmonize with the fields, and it is the ecological residence of the rural population who engaged in agricultural activities. It is also a typical vector, which is the symbiosis of people, fields, buildings, woods, and water. There are some unique spatial features of the farming Linpan, which provide spaces for drying cereals and corn, stacking farming tools, intensively-reared livestock, etc. These characteristics are reflected in this kind of Linpan settlement farming as the main mode of industrial structure.\n[[File:Farmhouse in Chengdu Plain.jpg|thumb|right|A farmhouse in Chengdu Plain.|245x245px]]\n\n===Ecological Type===\nWith the change of time, social development, improvement of living standards and the progress of rural-urban integration, at the same time Linpan also changing. The villagers no longer satisfied with living a life of self-sufficient farming, have moved to the urban area from Linpan Settlement, which has caused some empty Linpan Settlements. The role of these \"Empty Linpan\" is no longer for living, but has transformed to the ecological Linpan which has an ecological function for preserving the local environment.\n\n===Rural Tourism Type===\nAt present, the rapid population growth led to urban sprawl and dwindling agricultural land resources. Rural tourism as a compound of agricultural production and economic activities has become more and more popular. Thus, the Rural Tourism type of Linpan emerged in the Chengdu Plain. This type of Linpan mostly located in suburban areas, relying on agricultural production and make full use of the environment and transport advantages to develop rural inn and farmhouse catering services. It not only can satisfy local people's production and living needs, but also provide a tourism and vacation place for urban residents.\n\n===Specific Industrial Type===\nThe main function of agricultural and forest land in specific industrial Linpan is production. Generally, the requirements of landscape aesthetics are less than the other types of Linpan. This type of Linpan creates multiple agricultural eco-landscape. This kind of Linpan makes use of the traditional specific industry and enhances it, such as anti-season greenhouse vegetables and fruits, courtyard economy, livestock raising, and other specific industries.\n\n==The Threaten of Linpan in Chengdu Plain==\nWith the implementation of changes in land-use policies and urban-rural integration in China, most households are grouped together as a group-type settlement during the new rural construction. The original distribution of Linpan formula has been greatly affected by the construction practices of farmers and the government, and the distance between farmers and land is also pulled away. Many factors can cause the number of Linpan Settlement to dwindle. On one hand, many Linpan Settlements were removed or merged into a larger one. On the other hand, with the increasing number of part of the Linpan dwellers drift into cities, many Linpan Settlements are lack of management and change to be \u201cHollow Linpan\u201d. All of these lead the number of Linpan Settlement decreasing each year. [[Pi County]], a country near Chengdu, had more than 11,000 Linpan Settlement while there only has 8,000 now.

[[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] seized the town in an attempt to take control of the [[Atrato River]] region from [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] paramilitaries. During the fighting one of  Cylinder Bombs (known in Spanish as a ''pipeta'' or ''Cilindro bomba'') launched by the FARC with a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] at the AUC paramilitaries using the walls of the church for shelter, went trough the roof of the church, landing on the altar inside. Of the approximately 300 inhabitants that had taken refuge in the town, approximately 119 died in the explosion<ref name=\"centrodememoriahistorica\" />.\n\n==Background==\nThe Colombian government had described the area as subject to \"the armed confrontation in the region between the guerrillas and the illegal self-defence forces is very violent due to the economic and strategic interests in play, including, among others: [[drug trafficking]], the inter-oceanic connection, the development of [[megaproject]]s like the Panamerican Highway, and the proximity of ports and hydroelectric stations.

They remained there despite protests by local residents. The UNHCHR sent an official communication to the Colombian government on April 23 expressing their concern regarding the presence of the paramilitaries and the possible consequences for the local people.

The FARC took up positions to the north (in Barrio Pueblo Nuevo), and began launching gas cylinder bombs (''pipetas'') toward the paramilitary positions. Two landed nearby and the third went through the roof of the church, where it exploded on the altar.\n\nThe explosion resulted in approximately 119 dead and 98 wounded, though the UN was not able to verify exact numbers.

After prison-guards performed [[CPR]], he was transported in cardiac arrest to [[New York Downtown Hospital]], where he was pronounced dead at 6:39 AM. The [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|New York City medical examiner]] ruled Epstein's death a suicide by hanging, however, Epstein's lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation. [[Michael Baden]], who was hired by Epstein's brother to oversee the autopsy, has since become the most vocal proponent of the theory of homicidal strangulation rather than suicidal hanging.\n\nAfter initially expressing suspicion, Attorney General [[William Barr]] described Epstein's death as \"a perfect storm of screw-ups.\" Both the [[FBI]] and the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|U.S. Department of Justice's Inspector General]] are conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death.
