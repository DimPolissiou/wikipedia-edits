Republican values held monarchy in contempt, and despised Hellenic honours - Caesar had fatally courted both - but an outright refusal might offend loyal provincials and allies. A cautious formula was drawn up: non-Romans could only offer him cult as ''divus'' jointly with ''dea'' Roma.<ref>For a summary of modern viewpoints on the religious sincerity of Ruler cult see Harland, P.A., Introduction to ''Imperial Cults within Local Cultural Life: Associations in Roman Asia'', 2003.

Roma was thus absorbed into the earliest (Eastern) form of \"[[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]\" - or, from an Eastern viewpoint, the cult to Augustus was grafted onto their time-honoured cult to Roma. From here on, she increasingly took the attributes of an Imperial or divine consort to the Imperial ''divus'', but some Greek coin types show her as a seated or enthroned authority, and the Imperial ''divus'' standing upright as her supplicant or servant.<ref>Mellor, 972.</ref><ref>Ando, 45.</ref>\n\nThe Imperial cult arose as a pragmatic and ingenious response to an Eastern initiative. It blended and \"renewed\" ancient elements of traditional religions and Republican government to create a common cultural framework for the unification of Empire as a [[Principate]]. In the West, this was a novelty, as the Gauls, Germans and Celts had no native precedent for ruler cult or a Roman-style administration.<ref>Roma may have had joint (but unattested) cult with Augustus at the three colonial ''Arae Sestianae'' of the Iberian peninsula, probably founded shortly after 19 BC: see Mellor, 989.</ref>\n\nThe foundation of the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls|Imperial cult centre]] at [[Lugdunum]] introduced Roman models for provincial and municipal assemblies and government, a Romanised lifestyle, and an opportunity for local elites to enjoy the advantages of citizenship through election to Imperial cult priesthood, with an ''ara'' (altar) was dedicated to Roma and Augustus.<ref>The cult altar was inaugurated in 10 or 12 BC: Fishwick favours 12 BC as both practical and a particularly auspicious date for Augustus</ref> Thereafter, Roma is well attested by inscriptions and coinage throughout the Western provinces. Literary sources have little to say about her, but this may reflect her ubiquity rather than neglect: in the early Augustan era, she may have been honoured above her living Imperial consort.<ref>Fishwick sees the persistence of Roma's Hellenic seniority as ''dea'' (over the Augustan ''divus'') in Western Imperial cult.</ref><ref>Mellor, 990-993: Mellor finds Roma an essential companion to the Augustan and later Imperial divi, based on the surmise of Imperial cult as less one of obedience than a Romano-Hellenic framework for co-operation and acculturation: emperors of the Principate claimed to represent and sustain the \"[[senate and people of Rome]]\", not to dominate them.</ref><ref>Priests at the Lugdunum complex were known by the Greek title of ''sacerdos''. Most others were ''[[flamen]]'' who - contrary to Roman tradition - served a number of deities.  In general, female Imperial cult honorands (such as the living or deceased and deified Empress and state goddesses) were served by a priestess. Some were wife to the cult priest, but most may have been elected in their own right. One priestess is rather confusedly ''flamina sive sacerdos'' -  Western Imperial cults show remarkably liberal interpretations of cult and priesthood: some appear to be unique. However, with only one possible exception (at Toulouse) ''dea'' Roma was served by priests, as in her Hellenic cult. See Fishwick vol 1, 1, 101 & vol 3, 1, 12-13, & Mellor, 998-1002.</ref>\n\nIn [[Africa (Roman province)|provincial Africa]], one temple to Roma and Augustus is known at [[Leptis Magna]] and another at [[Maktar|Mactar]]. On the Italian peninsula, six have been proven - [[Latium]] built two, one of them privately funded. During the reign of Tiberius, [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] built a grand municipal temple to Roma and Augustus.<ref>Mellor, 1002-3.</ref>\n\nIn the city of Rome itself, the earliest known state cult to ''dea'' Roma was combined with cult to Venus at the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Temple of Venus and Roma]]. This was the largest temple in the city, probably dedicated to inaugurate the reformed festival of ''[[Parilia]]'', which was known thereafter as the ''Romaea'' after the Eastern festival in Roma's honour. The temple contained the seated, Hellenised image of ''dea'' Roma - the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] in her right hand symbolised Rome's eternity.<ref>Beard ''et al'', vol 1, 257-9.</ref><ref>Mellor, 963-4.</ref> In Rome, this was a novel realisation. Greek interpretations of Roma as a dignified deity had transformed her from a symbol of military dominance to one of Imperial protection and ''gravitas''.\n\nRoma's position could be more equivocal. Following the defeat of [[Clodius Albinus]] and his allies by [[Septimius Severus]] at Lugdunum, Roma was removed from the Lugdunum cult ''ara'' to the temple, where along with the Augusti she was co-opted into a new and repressive formulation of Imperial cult. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites at Lugdunum as those offered any ''[[paterfamilias]]'' by his slaves.<ref>Fishwick,Vol. 3, 1, 199.</ref> It is not known how long this phase lasted, but it appears to have been a unique development.\n\nIn a later, even more turbulent era, a common coin type of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] shows him in the radiate [[solar crown]] of the [[Dominate]]: the reverse offers Rome's Temple of Venus and dea Roma. While Probus' image shows his monarchic Imperium, Roma displays his claims to restoration of Roman tradition and Imperial unity.<ref>[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/probus.html Examples of Probus' coin types are shown at Doug Smith's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224173302/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/probus.html |date=2009-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n==In the New Testament==\nRoma is depicted in the [[Book of Revelation]] as the [[Whore of Babylon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIMam563-fsC&pg=PA528&lpg=PA528 Women in scripture: a dictionary of named and unnamed women in the Hebrew]</ref><ref>*[[L.

Caesar's adopted heir [[Augustus]] ended Rome's civil war and became [[princeps]] (\"leading man\") of the Republic, and in 30/29 BC, the ''[[koinon|koina]]'' of Asia and Bithynia requested permission to honour him as a living ''divus''. Republican values held monarchy in contempt, and despised Hellenic honours - Caesar had fatally courted both - but an outright refusal might offend loyal provincials and allies. A cautious formula was drawn up: non-Romans could only offer him cult as ''divus'' jointly with ''dea'' Roma.<ref>For a summary of modern viewpoints on the religious sincerity of Ruler cult see Harland, P.A., Introduction to ''Imperial Cults within Local Cultural Life: Associations in Roman Asia'', 2003.

Roma was thus absorbed into the earliest (Eastern) form of \"[[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]\" - or, from an Eastern viewpoint, the cult to Augustus was grafted onto their time-honoured cult to Roma. From here on, she increasingly took the attributes of an Imperial or divine consort to the Imperial ''divus'', but some Greek coin types show her as a seated or enthroned authority, and the Imperial ''divus'' standing upright as her supplicant or servant.<ref>Mellor, 972.</ref><ref>Ando, 45.</ref>\n\nThe Imperial cult arose as a pragmatic and ingenious response to an Eastern initiative. It blended and \"renewed\" ancient elements of traditional religions and Republican government to create a common cultural framework for the unification of Empire as a [[Principate]]. In the West, this was a novelty, as the Gauls, Germans and Celts had no native precedent for ruler cult or a Roman-style administration.<ref>Roma may have had joint (but unattested) cult with Augustus at the three colonial ''Arae Sestianae'' of the Iberian peninsula, probably founded shortly after 19 BC: see Mellor, 989.</ref>\n\nThe foundation of the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls|Imperial cult centre]] at [[Lugdunum]] introduced Roman models for provincial and municipal assemblies and government, a Romanised lifestyle, and an opportunity for local elites to enjoy the advantages of citizenship through election to Imperial cult priesthood, with an ''ara'' (altar) was dedicated to Roma and Augustus.<ref>The cult altar was inaugurated in 10 or 12 BC: Fishwick favours 12 BC as both practical and a particularly auspicious date for Augustus</ref> Thereafter, Roma is well attested by inscriptions and coinage throughout the Western provinces. Literary sources have little to say about her, but this may reflect her ubiquity rather than neglect: in the early Augustan era, she may have been honoured above her living Imperial consort.<ref>Fishwick sees the persistence of Roma's Hellenic seniority as ''dea'' (over the Augustan ''divus'') in Western Imperial cult.</ref><ref>Mellor, 990-993: Mellor finds Roma an essential companion to the Augustan and later Imperial divi, based on the surmise of Imperial cult as less one of obedience than a Romano-Hellenic framework for co-operation and acculturation: emperors of the Principate claimed to represent and sustain the \"[[senate and people of Rome]]\", not to dominate them.</ref><ref>Priests at the Lugdunum complex were known by the Greek title of ''sacerdos''. Most others were ''[[flamen]]'' who - contrary to Roman tradition - served a number of deities.  In general, female Imperial cult honorands (such as the living or deceased and deified Empress and state goddesses) were served by a priestess. Some were wife to the cult priest, but most may have been elected in their own right. One priestess is rather confusedly ''flamina sive sacerdos'' -  Western Imperial cults show remarkably liberal interpretations of cult and priesthood: some appear to be unique. However, with only one possible exception (at Toulouse) ''dea'' Roma was served by priests, as in her Hellenic cult. See Fishwick vol 1, 1, 101 & vol 3, 1, 12-13, & Mellor, 998-1002.</ref>\n\nIn [[Africa (Roman province)|provincial Africa]], one temple to Roma and Augustus is known at [[Leptis Magna]] and another at [[Maktar|Mactar]]. On the Italian peninsula, six have been proven - [[Latium]] built two, one of them privately funded. During the reign of Tiberius, [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] built a grand municipal temple to Roma and Augustus.<ref>Mellor, 1002-3.</ref>\n\nIn the city of Rome itself, the earliest known state cult to ''dea'' Roma was combined with cult to Venus at the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Temple of Venus and Roma]]. This was the largest temple in the city, probably dedicated to inaugurate the reformed festival of ''[[Parilia]]'', which was known thereafter as the ''Romaea'' after the Eastern festival in Roma's honour. The temple contained the seated, Hellenised image of ''dea'' Roma - the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]] in her right hand symbolised Rome's eternity.<ref>Beard ''et al'', vol 1, 257-9.</ref><ref>Mellor, 963-4.</ref> In Rome, this was a novel realisation. Greek interpretations of Roma as a dignified deity had transformed her from a symbol of military dominance to one of Imperial protection and ''gravitas''.\n\nRoma's position could be more equivocal. Following the defeat of [[Clodius Albinus]] and his allies by [[Septimius Severus]] at Lugdunum, Roma was removed from the Lugdunum cult ''ara'' to the temple, where along with the Augusti she was co-opted into a new and repressive formulation of Imperial cult. Fishwick interprets the reformed rites at Lugdunum as those offered any ''[[paterfamilias]]'' by his slaves.<ref>Fishwick,Vol. 3, 1, 199.</ref> It is not known how long this phase lasted, but it appears to have been a unique development.\n\nIn a later, even more turbulent era, a common coin type of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] shows him in the radiate [[solar crown]] of the [[Dominate]]: the reverse offers Rome's Temple of Venus and dea Roma. While Probus' image shows his monarchic Imperium, Roma displays his claims to restoration of Roman tradition and Imperial unity.<ref>[http://dougsmith.ancients.info/probus.html Examples of Probus' coin types are shown at Doug Smith's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224173302/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/probus.html |date=2009-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n==In the New Testament==\nRoma is depicted in the [[Book of Revelation]] as the [[Whore of Babylon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIMam563-fsC&pg=PA528&lpg=PA528 Women in scripture: a dictionary of named and unnamed women in the Hebrew]</ref><ref>*[[L.

Playing early missions with higher difficulties require a higher level fighter. To unlock Ultimate difficulty, at least 1 Expert mission must be completed.\n\nPlayer can choose which mission to complete in any order within a game, but a completed mission cannot be chosen more than twice per game.\n\nAt the end of each mission, the fighter is given a rank from S (highest) to E (lowest) based on score, obtained element, collected capsules, received damage, life loss. The rank determines ST points earned by the fighter. ST point is also determined by:\n\n*Difficulty. Higher ST points with more difficult mission, lower otherwise.\n*Continues.\n*Death. Every time the game is continued, obtained elements are reduced by half.\n\nIf the mission is completed with poor performance, it is possible for the fighter to lose ST points.\n\n*San Salvador\n*Alexandria\n*Tokyo\n*Antarctica\n*Easter Island (2009-08): Paid downloadable level in Otomedius Gorgeous!\n\nThere are 5 areas in the game. The difficulty of each area depends on player's average skill level. Player has infinite fighter stock, and the burst gauge slowly recovers.\n\nEach area consists of grunt battle, followed by treasure hatch (except area E), then boss battle. The boss of each area (except area E) changes between games.\n\nIn treasure hatch region, opening hatch causes enemy to appear. The hatch shows the icon type for a given hatch, but when a hatch is destroyed, a different icon appears, which causes different effect:\n*Points icon: Increases bonus points.\n*Element icon: Causes Enemy that releases element to appear.\n*Capsule icon: Causes Enemy that releases power capsule to appear.\n*Sky icon: Releases indestructible iron ball.\n\nAt the end of each game, overall rankings between players were given based on bonuses decided by the ranks of collected element, collected capsule, received damage. The overall highest ranked player gains ST points, while 2nd rank player gains no ST points, and 3rd rank player loses ST points.\n\n==Plot==\nThousands of years have passed since the war of Planet Gradius and sub-space Bacterion.

Playing early missions with higher difficulties require a higher level fighter. To unlock Ultimate difficulty, at least 1 Expert mission must be completed.\n\nPlayer can choose which mission to complete in any order within a game, but a completed mission cannot be chosen more than twice per game.\n\nAt the end of each mission, the fighter is given a rank from S (highest) to E (lowest) based on score, obtained element, collected capsules, received damage, life loss. The rank determines ST points earned by the fighter. ST point is also determined by:\n\n*Difficulty. Higher ST points with more difficult mission, lower otherwise.\n*Continues.\n*Death.

The boss of each area (except area E) changes between games.\n\nIn treasure hatch region, opening hatch causes enemy to appear. The hatch shows the icon type for a given hatch, but when a hatch is destroyed, a different icon appears, which causes different effect:\n*Points icon: Increases bonus points.\n*Element icon: Causes Enemy that releases element to appear.\n*Capsule icon: Causes Enemy that releases power capsule to appear.\n*Sky icon: Releases indestructible iron ball.\n\nAt the end of each game, overall rankings between players were given based on bonuses decided by the ranks of collected element, collected capsule, received damage. The overall highest ranked player gains ST points, while 2nd rank player gains no ST points, and 3rd rank player loses ST points.\n\n==Plot==\nThousands of years have passed since the war of Planet Gradius and sub-space Bacterion.

With Frank as interim head coach, the Nets overcame adversity, ending the season with a 47\u201335 record. Despite this, the Nets still managed to repeat as Division Champions and earn the number 2 spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nAfter sweeping the [[2003\u201304 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] in the opening round of the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the second round pitted the Nets against the [[2003\u201304 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in last year's Conference championship rematch. However, Detroit would get revenge this time, and would eventually win the series in seven games, ending the 2003\u201304 season for the Nets.
