The total distance was {{convert|5287|km|mi}} and the average speed of the riders was {{convert|26.715|km/h|mph}}.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}} The competition was won by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Philippe Thys]], after in the crucial sixth stage [[Eug\u00e8ne Christophe]] broke his bicycle and lost several hours because he had to do the repairs by himself. In the last stage, Thys also had mechanical problems, but he got help during the repairs, and only got a penalty of ten minutes.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1912, the overall classification had been calculated by points, but in 1913 the classification was reverted to the original format from 1903, where the overall classification was calculated by adding up the times of the individual stages. The general classification has been calculated in the time format ever since.\n\n==Innovations and changes==\nIn 1905, the format of the Tour de France had been changed from the time system to the points system, to reduce the cheating that had caused the first four cyclists of the 1904 Tour de France to be disqualified. In the 1912 Tour de France, this system had been working against [[Eug\u00e8ne Christophe]]'s chances, who would have been leading the time classification up until the final stage where he allowed a group to ride away.<ref name=\"veloarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1912.php |title=1912: Belgian victory foreshadows problems to come |publisher=VeloArchive |author=Tom James |date=14 August 2003 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5glvybhFd?url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1912.php |archive-date=14 May 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> The system had been working against a French cyclist and in favor of a Belgian cyclist ([[Odiel Defraye]], who won the Tour de France in 1912), and the French organisation changed the system back again to the time system: the finishing times of all stages were added per cyclist, and the cyclist with the least total time was the winner. This was also intended to increase combativity, because in the points system riders did not care about time gaps, so escaped low-ranked riders were ignored by high-ranked cyclists.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|p=38}}\n\nFor the first time, the route of the race was in the opposite direction. Prior to the 1913 race, the Tour the France always had been in the clockwise direction through France, and in 1913 it was anticlockwise.<ref name=\"mdc1913\"/>\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1913 Tour de France}}\n\nThe 1913 Tour started with 140 cyclists; there were 51 cyclists distributed over 9 teams, including all favourites for the overall victory. The remaining 89 cyclists started in the isol\u00e9s category.<ref name=\"mdc1913\"/> This edition started with six former Tour de France winners ([[Louis Trousselier]], [[Lucien Petit-Breton]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]], [[Octave Lapize]], [[Gustave Garrigou]] and [[Odile Defraye]]), the most ever.<ref name=\"veloarchive1913\"/>\n\nAlthough cyclists had started in teams previously, the rules had forbidden them to work together against other cyclists. In 1913, this changed, and cyclists from the same team were allowed to work together. The organisers preferred riders to ride solo, so they added a rule that if a cyclist would win a stage with a margin of 20 minutes or more, he would not only get his own prize money, but also the half of all the other cyclists' prize money of that stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.historischekranten.be/issue/DPO/1913-06-29/edition/null/page/2?query=%22ronde%20van%20frankrijk%22&period=1903-1939&sort=issuedate%20ascending|title=De ronde van Frankrijk|language=Dutch|date=29 June 1913|accessdate=20 May 2014|work=De Poperinghenaar}}</ref>\n\nThe first African cyclist took part in the Tour de France in 1913: [[Ali Neffati]] from Tunisia.

Micheletto was not part of the first group in the second stage, and thus lost his lead.

At the start of the sixth stage, last year's winner Defraye lead the general classification, some 5 minutes ahead of [[Eug\u00e8ne Christophe]].{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|p=38}} In that sixth stage, the first mountains were climbed. Defraye was dropped quickly, and Christophe lead the race.<ref name=\"veloarchive1913\"/> Christophe came up first on the Aubisque, and in second place behind [[Philippe Thys]] on the [[Tourmalet]]. On the way down from the Tourmalet, Christophe was hit by a race vehicle,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/07/cycling.features|title=There's unlucky ... and then there's Christophe|first=Matt|last=Rendell|date=7 January 2007|accessdate=17 December 2015|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]}}</ref> and his fork broke, rendering his bike unusable, and the rules said that he had to repair it himself. He walked more than 10&nbsp;km down to the next village, and found a place where he could repair his bicycle. He worked on it for over three hours, being watched by race officials who made sure that he was not helped by anyone. When Christophe asked a small boy, of seven years old, to work the [[bellows]], he was fined with ten minutes.<ref name=\"veloarchive1913\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1913.php|title=1913: Eug\u00e8ne Christophe, Ste.

In the ninth stage, Buysse had mechanical failure with a broken handlebar, and finished almost three and a half hours after stage winner Lambot. This was the end of the chances for Buysse for the victory.<ref name=\"letour.fr\"/> Buysse did not give up, and won four of the remaining five stages.{{sfn|Amels|1984|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nThe lead had transferred to Thys now. In the last stages, the race focussed on the duel between Petit-Breton and Thys. In the 14th stage, Petit-Breton fell down and stopped the race. In the same stage, Thys also fell down and remained unconscious for a while. When he was conscious again, he was helped to repair his bicycle. All help was illegal in 1913, but the jury only gave him a 10-minute penalty.<ref name=\"mdc1913\"/> Thys finished the stage, and kept 8'37\" in front of [[Gustave Garrigou]] in the general classification.

The total distance was {{convert|5287|km|mi}} and the average speed of the riders was {{convert|26.715|km/h|mph}}.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}} The competition was won by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Philippe Thys]], after in the crucial sixth stage [[Eug\u00e8ne Christophe]] broke his bicycle and lost several hours because he had to do the repairs by himself. In the last stage, Thys also had mechanical problems, but he got help during the repairs, and only got a penalty of ten minutes.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1912, the overall classification had been calculated by points, but in 1913 the classification was reverted to the original format from 1903, where the overall classification was calculated by adding up the times of the individual stages. The general classification has been calculated in the time format ever since.\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nIn 1905, the format of the Tour de France had been changed from the time system to the points system, to reduce the cheating that had caused the first four cyclists of the 1904 Tour de France to be disqualified. In the 1912 Tour de France, this system had been working against [[Eug\u00e8ne Christophe]]'s chances, who would have been leading the time classification up until the final stage where he allowed a group to ride away.<ref name=\"veloarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1912.php |title=1912: Belgian victory foreshadows problems to come |publisher=VeloArchive |author=Tom James |date=14 August 2003 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5glvybhFd?url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1912.php |archive-date=14 May 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> The system had been working against a French cyclist and in favor of a Belgian cyclist ([[Odiel Defraye]], who won the Tour de France in 1912), and the French organisation changed the system back again to the time system: the finishing times of all stages were added per cyclist, and the cyclist with the least total time was the winner. This was also intended to increase combativity, because in the points system riders did not care about time gaps, so escaped low-ranked riders were ignored by high-ranked cyclists.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|p=38}}\n\nFor the first time, the route of the race was in the opposite direction. Prior to the 1913 race, the Tour the France always had been in the clockwise direction through France, and in 1913 it was anticlockwise.<ref name=\"mdc1913\"/>\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1913 Tour de France}}\n\nThe 1913 Tour started with 140 cyclists; there were 51 cyclists distributed over 9 teams, including all favourites for the overall victory.

In 1913, this changed, and cyclists from the same team were allowed to work together. The organisers preferred riders to ride solo, so they added a rule that if a cyclist would win a stage with a margin of 20 minutes or more, he would not only get his own prize money, but also the half of all the other cyclists' prize money of that stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.historischekranten.be/issue/DPO/1913-06-29/edition/null/page/2?query=%22ronde%20van%20frankrijk%22&period=1903-1939&sort=issuedate%20ascending|title=De ronde van Frankrijk|language=Dutch|date=29 June 1913|accessdate=20 May 2014|work=De Poperinghenaar}}</ref>\n\nThe first African cyclist took part in the Tour de France in 1913: [[Ali Neffati]] from Tunisia.

'E mykena\u00efke akropolis ton Athenon'. Athens.</ref> Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as [[Mycenae]] and [[Pylos]], it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200&nbsp;BC, an event often attributed to a [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure [[Ionians]] with no Dorian element. However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.\n\n[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900&nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.<ref>Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200\u2013479&nbsp;BC''.</ref> The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].\n\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|[[Delian League]], under the leadership of Athens before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&nbsp;BC]]\n\nBy the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being [[Achaemenid destruction of Athens|captured and sacked twice]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&pg=PA34|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|accessdate=24 December 2014|isbn=978-1400834303|last1=Lewis|first1=John David|date=25 January 2010}}</ref> after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.\n\nThe decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival [[Sparta]].\n\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a [[free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century CE, ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].\n\nBy the end of [[Late Antiquity]], Athens had shrunk due to sacks by the [[Herulians]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Early Slavs]] which caused massive destruction in the city. In this era, the first Christian churches were built in Athens, and the [[Parthenon]] and other temples were converted into churches. Athens expanded its settlement in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.\n\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.\n\nIn the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Kylix Theseus Aison MNA Inv11365 n1.jpg|Tondo of the Aison Cup, showing the victory of [[Theseus]] over the [[Minotaur]] in the presence of [[Athena]].

They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly [[Drama (Art Form)|dramatic forms of Art]], they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include [[Orestis Makris]], [[Kalouta sisters]], [[Vasilis Avlonitis]], [[Afroditi Laoutari]], [[Eleni Papadaki]], [[Marika Nezer]], [[Marika Krevata]] and others.

Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[foxtrot]], some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. [[Nikos Gounaris]] was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.\n\nIn 1923, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], many [[ethnic Greeks]] from [[Asia Minor]] fled to Athens as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]].

Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.\n\nThe Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].\n\nBeyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n==== Sports clubs ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Notable sport clubs based inside the boundaries of [[Athens#Municipality (City) of Athens|Athens Municipality]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Club\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Founded\n!Sports\n!District\n!Achievements\n|-\n|[[Panellinios G.S.]]||1891||Basketball, Volleyball, [[Handball]], Track and Field and others ||[[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]||Panhellenic titles in Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, many honours in Track and Field\n|-\n|[[GS Apollon Smyrnis|Apollon Smyrni]]||1891<br/><small>(originally in [[Smyrni]])</small>||Football, Basketball, Volleyball and others ||[[Rizoupoli]]||Earlier long-time presence in A Ethniki\n|-\n|[[Ethnikos G.S.

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000<ref name=tung2/> and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\">\nFile:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].\nFile:Panathenaic Stadium.jpg|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896.\n</gallery>\n\n===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}\nThe [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.\n\n===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}\n[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.<ref name=oly/> It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.<ref name=oly/> Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.<ref name=oly/>\n\nDuring the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.\n\nAlthough the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name=olyy>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games.

'E mykena\u00efke akropolis ton Athenon'. Athens.</ref> Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as [[Mycenae]] and [[Pylos]], it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200&nbsp;BC, an event often attributed to a [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were pure [[Ionians]] with no Dorian element. However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.\n\n[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900&nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.<ref>Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200\u2013479&nbsp;BC''.</ref> The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].\n\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|[[Delian League]], under the leadership of Athens before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&nbsp;BC]]\n\nBy the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being [[Achaemenid destruction of Athens|captured and sacked twice]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&pg=PA34|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|accessdate=24 December 2014|isbn=978-1400834303|last1=Lewis|first1=John David|date=25 January 2010}}</ref> after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.\n\nThe decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival [[Sparta]].\n\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a [[free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century CE, ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].\n\nBy the end of [[Late Antiquity]], Athens had shrunk due to sacks by the [[Herulians]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Early Slavs]] which caused massive destruction in the city. In this era, the first Christian churches were built in Athens, and the [[Parthenon]] and other temples were converted into churches. Athens expanded its settlement in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.\n\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following World War II, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.\n\nIn the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Kylix Theseus Aison MNA Inv11365 n1.jpg|Tondo of the Aison Cup, showing the victory of [[Theseus]] over the [[Minotaur]] in the presence of [[Athena]].

They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city.\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly [[Drama (Art Form)|dramatic forms of Art]], they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include [[Orestis Makris]], [[Kalouta sisters]], [[Vasilis Avlonitis]], [[Afroditi Laoutari]], [[Eleni Papadaki]], [[Marika Nezer]], [[Marika Krevata]] and others.

Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[foxtrot]], some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. [[Nikos Gounaris]] was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.\n\nIn 1923, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], many [[ethnic Greeks]] from [[Asia Minor]] fled to Athens as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]].

Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.\n\nThe Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].\n\nBeyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n==== Sports clubs ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Notable sport clubs based inside the boundaries of [[Athens#Municipality (City) of Athens|Athens Municipality]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Club\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Founded\n!Sports\n!District\n!Achievements\n|-\n|[[Panellinios G.S.]]||1891||Basketball, Volleyball, [[Handball]], Track and Field and others ||[[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]||Panhellenic titles in Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, many honours in Track and Field\n|-\n|[[GS Apollon Smyrnis|Apollon Smyrni]]||1891<br/><small>(originally in [[Smyrni]])</small>||Football, Basketball, Volleyball and others ||[[Rizoupoli]]||Earlier long-time presence in A Ethniki\n|-\n|[[Ethnikos G.S.

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000<ref name=tung2/> and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\">\nFile:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].\nFile:Panathenaic Stadium.jpg|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896.\n</gallery>\n\n===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}}\nThe [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued.\n\n===== 2004 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}}\n[[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]]\n\nAthens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States.<ref name=oly/> It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41.<ref name=oly/> Prior to this round, the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], Stockholm and [[Cape Town]] had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.<ref name=oly/>\n\nDuring the first three years of preparations, the [[International Olympic Committee]] had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.\n\nAlthough the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name=olyy>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games.

It was composed of 15 stages over {{convert|5343|km|mi}}, ridden at an average speed of 27.322&nbsp;km/h.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}} The results were computed by giving each rider points according to his finishing position on each stage, and the rider with the fewest points at the end of the race won the overall competition. It was a gruelling tour, with the longest stage, 470&nbsp;km long, taking almost 18 hours for the fastest riders to complete. Out of the 84 riders who started the tour, only 28 completed the race. After the introduction of the Pyrenees in the previous edition, in 1911 the Alps were first visited; for this addition, the 1911 edition has been named the first modern Tour.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}}\n\nNewcomer [[Paul Duboc]] won four stages and was close to winning the Tour, but he fell sick midway through the race while he was in second place in the general classification. The winner was [[Gustave Garrigou]], who also won two stages.\n\n==Innovations and changes==\nIn 1910, the Tour de France included the Pyrenees mountains for the first time. That was a success, so in 1911 the Tour organisers also included the Alps.<ref name=\"VeloArchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1911.php |title=1911: Faber meets his Galibier |accessdate=16 April 2009 |author=Tom James |date=14 August 2003 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWiA5IhM?url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1911.php |archivedate=4 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The favourite mountain of the Tour organiser [[Henri Desgrange]] was the [[Col du Galibier]], about which he wrote \"O, [[col Bayard]], O, [[Tourmalet]]... next to Galibier you are worthless.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/TdF/TdF1911.htm|author=Barry Boyce|year=2004|publisher=Cycling revealed|title=The Grand Galibier|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> During the 1910 Tour, cyclists had protested against the inclusion of high mountains, but at the 1911 Tour, all important cyclists were present.{{sfn|Amels|1984|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nWhat did not change was the points system; similar to the 1905\u20131910 Tours, this race was decided on points. A cyclist received points, based on their rankings. As in 1910, the points system was \"cleaned up\" two times: after the ninth stage and after the 14th stage. Cyclists who had abandoned the race were removed from the rankings of the previous stages, and the classification was recalculated.<ref name=\"mdc1911\"/>\n\nSince 1906, the Tour de France had crossed the German border into [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. After 1910, the German authorities did not allow this any more, so the Tour stayed in France.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=68}}\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1911 Tour de France}}\n\n[[File:Tour de France 30 juillet 1911 Garrigou.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Gustave Garrigou]] after winning the race.]]\nAs in the year before, there were two categories of riders. The best riders started in sponsored teams; there were four different teams, with 37 riders in total.<ref name=\"mdc1911\"/> The stages had checkpoints where riders had to sign, and on these checkpoints the sponsored riders were allowed to be given food and drinks. The other category consisted of 47 isolated riders; they were not allowed to be given food or drinks during these checkpoints.<ref name=\"vs\"/>\n\nThe previous edition had been a close battle between teammates [[Octave Lapize]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]] from the [[Alcyon (cycling team)|Alcyon team]], won by Lapize.

In the ninth stage, Faber lost contact with Garrigou in the general classification by finishing in twentieth place.

According to the rules, no help was allowed, so other cyclists rode by him while he was lying on the road, vomiting. Duboc was able to get on his bicycle again, and finished the stage in 21st place, which left him no hopes for the victory.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}} Nowadays, it is thought that [[Fran\u00e7ois Lafourcade]], a cyclist who performed well in the mountains of the 1910 Tour had something to do with it, but in 1911 the first suspect was his main competitor Garrigou. Garrigou was threatened, and the Tour organisation gave him a bodyguard, and when the Tour passed Duboc's home town, Garrigou was disguised.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}}\n\nDuboc regained his strengths and won two more stages, but was unable to close the gap to Garrigou in the general classification, so Garrigou became the winner of the race.

It was composed of 15 stages over {{convert|5343|km|mi}}, ridden at an average speed of 27.322&nbsp;km/h.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}} The results were computed by giving each rider points according to his finishing position on each stage, and the rider with the fewest points at the end of the race won the overall competition. It was a gruelling tour, with the longest stage, 470&nbsp;km long, taking almost 18 hours for the fastest riders to complete. Out of the 84 riders who started the tour, only 28 completed the race. After the introduction of the Pyrenees in the previous edition, in 1911 the Alps were first visited; for this addition, the 1911 edition has been named the first modern Tour.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}}\n\nNewcomer [[Paul Duboc]] won four stages and was close to winning the Tour, but he fell sick midway through the race while he was in second place in the general classification. The winner was [[Gustave Garrigou]], who also won two stages.\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nIn 1910, the Tour de France included the Pyrenees mountains for the first time. That was a success, so in 1911 the Tour organisers also included the Alps.<ref name=\"VeloArchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1911.php |title=1911: Faber meets his Galibier |accessdate=16 April 2009 |author=Tom James |date=14 August 2003 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWiA5IhM?url=http://www.veloarchive.com/races/tour/1911.php |archivedate=4 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The favourite mountain of the Tour organiser [[Henri Desgrange]] was the [[Col du Galibier]], about which he wrote \"O, [[col Bayard]], O, [[Tourmalet]]... next to Galibier you are worthless.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/TdF/TdF1911.htm|author=Barry Boyce|year=2004|publisher=Cycling revealed|title=The Grand Galibier|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> During the 1910 Tour, cyclists had protested against the inclusion of high mountains, but at the 1911 Tour, all important cyclists were present.{{sfn|Amels|1984|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nWhat did not change was the points system; similar to the 1905\u20131910 Tours, this race was decided on points. A cyclist received points, based on their rankings. As in 1910, the points system was \"cleaned up\" two times: after the ninth stage and after the 14th stage. Cyclists who had abandoned the race were removed from the rankings of the previous stages, and the classification was recalculated.<ref name=\"mdc1911\"/>\n\nSince 1906, the Tour de France had crossed the German border into [[Alsace-Lorraine]].

In third place was [[Paul Duboc]], a surprising newcomer.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}}\n\n[[File:Tour de France 30 juillet 1911 Duboc.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Paul Duboc]] finished second overall.]]\nDuboc was the strongest in the eighth stage, and after his stage victory, he was in second place in the general classification. In the ninth stage, Faber lost contact with Garrigou in the general classification by finishing in twentieth place. Duboc won again, and had shown that he was a good climber, and was considered a favourite for the tenth stage which also included mountains, and a serious threat for Garrigou in the generalt classification;{{sfn|Amels|1984|pp=15\u201316}} after this stage, Garrigou was leading with 27 points, while Duboc had 37 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1911_9.php |title=9\u00e8me Tour de France 1911 - 9\u00e8me \u00e9tape |publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme |language=French |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWiARO45?url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1903_1939/tdf1911_9.php |archivedate=4 May 2009  |url-status=dead }}</ref> In that ninth stage, [[Maurice Brocco]] who knew that he would not win the Tour, had sold his services to another cyclist.

According to the rules, no help was allowed, so other cyclists rode by him while he was lying on the road, vomiting. Duboc was able to get on his bicycle again, and finished the stage in 21st place, which left him no hopes for the victory.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}} Nowadays, it is thought that [[Fran\u00e7ois Lafourcade]], a cyclist who performed well in the mountains of the 1910 Tour had something to do with it, but in 1911 the first suspect was his main competitor Garrigou. Garrigou was threatened, and the Tour organisation gave him a bodyguard, and when the Tour passed Duboc's home town, Garrigou was disguised.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=30\u201335}}\n\nDuboc regained his strengths and won two more stages, but was unable to close the gap to Garrigou in the general classification, so Garrigou became the winner of the race.

It consisted of 15 stages over {{convert|4734|km|mi}}, ridden at an average speed of 28.680&nbsp;km/h.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}} It was the first Tour to enter the [[Pyrenees]] mountains. Two main candidates for the victory were 1909 winner [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]], a sprinter, and [[Octave Lapize]], a climber, both members of the powerful [[Alcyon (cycling team)|Alcyon team]]. Because of the points system, their chances for the overall victory were approximately equal. The race was not decided until the final stage, after which Lapize had won by a difference of only four points.\n\n==Innovations and changes==\nThe courses of the Tour de France in 1907, 1908 and 1909 had been nearly identical. In 1910, the [[Pyrenees]] were included, an initiative from [[Adolphe Stein\u00e8s]], who had drawn the course for the Tour de France since the first Tour in 1903.{{sfn|Amels|1984|pp=15\u201316}} Compared to the 1907, 1908 and 1909 Tours, the stages N\u00eemes-Toulouse and Toulouse-Bayonne were replaced by three stages, N\u00eemes\u2013Perpignan, Perpignan\u2013Luchon and Luchon\u2013Bayonne.<ref name=\"mdc1910\"/>\n\nTour organiser [[Henri Desgrange]] at first refused the inclusion of the Pyrenees,{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=640\u2013646}} but later gave in and sent Stein\u00e8s to the Pyrenees to see if it was possible to send cyclists up the mountains. Stein\u00e8s encountered many difficulties. He went there at 27 January 1910, and asked an innkeeper for directions over the Tourmalet. The innkeeper replied that it is barely crossable in July, so practically impossible in January. Stein\u00e8s hired a car anyway and rode up the mountain. Close to the top, there was so much snow that the car could not go further, and he continued on foot. Stein\u00e8s walked during the night, and fell down a ravine.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=640\u2013646}} At 3 a.m. he was found by a search party.

[[Lucien Petit-Breton]], [[Maurice Brocco]], [[Henri Cornet]], [[Charles Pavese]] and [[Jean Alavoine]] rode with gears.<ref name=\"mdc1910\"/>\n\nWhat had not changed was the points system.

It consisted of 15 stages over {{convert|4734|km|mi}}, ridden at an average speed of 28.680&nbsp;km/h.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=108}} It was the first Tour to enter the [[Pyrenees]] mountains. Two main candidates for the victory were 1909 winner [[Fran\u00e7ois Faber]], a sprinter, and [[Octave Lapize]], a climber, both members of the powerful [[Alcyon (cycling team)|Alcyon team]]. Because of the points system, their chances for the overall victory were approximately equal. The race was not decided until the final stage, after which Lapize had won by a difference of only four points.\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nThe courses of the Tour de France in 1907, 1908 and 1909 had been nearly identical. In 1910, the [[Pyrenees]] were included, an initiative from [[Adolphe Stein\u00e8s]], who had drawn the course for the Tour de France since the first Tour in 1903.{{sfn|Amels|1984|pp=15\u201316}} Compared to the 1907, 1908 and 1909 Tours, the stages N\u00eemes-Toulouse and Toulouse-Bayonne were replaced by three stages, N\u00eemes\u2013Perpignan, Perpignan\u2013Luchon and Luchon\u2013Bayonne.<ref name=\"mdc1910\"/>\n\nTour organiser [[Henri Desgrange]] at first refused the inclusion of the Pyrenees,{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=640\u2013646}} but later gave in and sent Stein\u00e8s to the Pyrenees to see if it was possible to send cyclists up the mountains. Stein\u00e8s encountered many difficulties. He went there at 27 January 1910, and asked an innkeeper for directions over the Tourmalet. The innkeeper replied that it is barely crossable in July, so practically impossible in January. Stein\u00e8s hired a car anyway and rode up the mountain. Close to the top, there was so much snow that the car could not go further, and he continued on foot. Stein\u00e8s walked during the night, and fell down a ravine.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=640\u2013646}} At 3 a.m. he was found by a search party.

A cyclist received points, based on their rankings. As in 1909, the points system was \"cleaned up\" two times: after the 9th stage and after the 14th stage.

The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] (VVKJ) had only 77 modern [[fighter aircraft]] available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and [[bomber]]s that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets and divulging the VVKJ's codes.\n\nThree more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The bombing of Belgrade was preceded by the commencement of the ground invasion a few hours earlier, and coincided with air attacks on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the [[National Library of Serbia]], which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the [[Belgrade Zoo]].\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] carried out two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], in retaliation for the attacks on Yugoslavia, which ultimately surrendered on 17 April. The senior [[Luftwaffe]] officer responsible for the bombing, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948. A monument erected in [[New Belgrade]] in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defense. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.\n\n==Background==\n===Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat===\n{{main|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|Tripartite Pact}}\nFollowing [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] political pressure as her neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] when that country [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]]. Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] also joined the Pact.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their [[client state]]s, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] to [[Berchtesgaden]], and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 1 March, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}}\n\nFurther pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} On 6 March, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=13}} On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|complied]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]] officers, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Borivoje Mirkovi\u0107]], deposed Prince Paul in a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=43\u201344}} He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], who was declared to be of age to accede to the throne.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}\n\n===Preparations===\n{{main|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe day of the coup, Hitler issued [[Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]], which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the [[Balkans]]. He ordered that \"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler decided that [[Belgrade]] would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (''Unternehmen Strafgericht''). On 27 and 28 March 1941, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' IV]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (General) [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L\u00f6hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}} Although Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, at the last minute L\u00f6hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}}\n\nOn 3 April, [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] defected to the Germans, flying a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to [[Graz]] in Austria, and disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} On the afternoon of 5 April, a British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] visited Mirkovi\u0107 at the VVKJ base in [[Zemun]] and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the following morning.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an [[open city]] in the event of hostilities. Although the German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \"Fortress Belgrade\" after the first bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}}\n\nBy 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern [[medium bomber]]s. Other than a small number of locally made [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}} The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E-3a fighters, 15 [[Hawker Hurricane]] MkIs, and six Rogo\u017earski IK-3s.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n==Bombing==\n{{also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016226-0005A, Belgrad, Altes Schloss, Sch\u00e4den.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The bomb-damaged [[Stari dvor|Old Palace]] in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941.|alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background]]\nGerman ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]], ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' [[Joseph Goebbels]], announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}} The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with [[Easter]] Sunday as observed by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which uses the [[Julian calendar]].{{sfn|Zaki\u0107|2017|p=64}} Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based ''Fliegerf\u00fchrer'' Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=196}}\n\nThe first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers, and 160 [[Heinkel He 111]] medium bombers and [[Dornier Do 17]] [[light bomber]]s at {{convert|8000|-|10000|ft|m}}. They were escorted by [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] [[heavy fighter]]s at {{convert|11000|-|12000|ft|m}} and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=195}} The entire Yugoslav 6th Fighter Brigade, consisting of the 51st Fighter Group at Zemun and the 32nd Fighter Group at [[Prnjavor (Belgrade)#Boroughs|Prnjavor]], totalling 29 Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and five Rogo\u017earski IK-3s, were scrambled to intercept the Germans.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013197}} The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG 77). Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at [[Kni\u0107]] arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one ''Stuka'' shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013198}} On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the [[General Post Office, Belgrade|post office]] including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Supreme Command]] building, the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|military academy]], the [[Royal Compound, Belgrade|royal palace at Dedinje]], the royal guard barracks at [[Top\u010dider]], the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}}\n\nImmediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters. They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at [[Kragujevac]], acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n[[File:Bombed National Library Belgrad.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A 2008 photograph of the ruins of the National Library of Serbia, bombed on 6 April 1941|alt=an overgrown crater with ruined walls around part of the perimeter]]\nBelgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, consisting of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near [[Vienna]], escorted by 60 fighters. This wave was met by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, which claimed four German aircraft. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n\nThe Germans claimed nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April. Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged. The Yugoslavs claimed to have shot down twenty-two German aircraft and forced two others to land. The Germans lost twelve aircraft, significantly fewer than claimed by the Yugoslavs: two Do 17Z light bombers, five Bf 110 heavy fighters, four Ju 87 dive bombers, and one Bf 109E fighter.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' [[Gerhard Koall]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} He went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in 1944.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=216}}\n\nGerman bombers and dive-bombers dropped {{convert|215|-|360|LT|ST}} of [[aerial bomb|bombs]] and [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]] on the capital.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}}{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=194}} The weak VVKJ and inadequate anti-aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault, but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack. Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders. A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft, downed 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on the ground.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}} The military historian Daniel L.

Pavlowitch]], the bombing of Belgrade lasted three days.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the [[National Library of Serbia]], which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of rare books, maps, and [[medieval]] manuscripts were destroyed.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=41}} Also struck was the [[Belgrade Zoo]], sending frightened animals running through the streets.{{sfn|Freeman|2008|p=94}}\n\n==British retaliation==\n[[No. 37 Squadron RAF|No. 37 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) conducted two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. Operating [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from an airfield in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], the squadron conducted raids on 6/7 April and 12/13 April, dropping a total of {{convert|30|LT|ST}} of high-explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941. The historian Herman Knell calls the retaliatory justification for these raids \"strange and implausible\".{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=195}} The aviation historians Shores, Cull and Malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on the lines of communication of German forces attacking Greece and Yugoslavia, and note that the raid on 6/7 April targeted an ammunition train and other installations in Sofia, and the raid on 12/13 April bombed the railway marshalling yards. Other similar targets in Bulgaria were attacked by the RAF during the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=232, 243}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Spomenik pilotima 1941.JPG|thumb|200px|Monument to the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution, located in [[New Belgrade]]|alt=rectangular polished dark stone plinth pointing toward the sky, with a winged plaque and inscription at the base]]\nThe bombing of Belgrade paralyzed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters, and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Civilian casualties were significant, but sources vary widely from 1,500 to 17,000 killed.{{sfn|Knell|2009|pp=194\u2013195}} They were worsened by the disclosure of air-raid shelter locations to the Germans in the days preceding the attack.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} The official casualty figure released by the occupation authorities soon after the bombing was 2,271 killed. Other sources mention 5,000 to 10,000 fatalities, and later Yugoslav estimates ranged even higher.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=16}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=18}} The historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following \"careful postwar investigations\", and indicates that a figure between 3,000 and 4,000 is more realistic.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=74}}\n\nBelgrade was occupied on 13 April 1941, and four days later, Yugoslavia capitulated.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=19}} Afterwards, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that {{convert|218.5|MT}} of bombs were dropped, 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped, and that areas in the centre and northwest of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of the aerial mines.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Significant damage was done to Belgrade, particularly to the water and electrical systems.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=17\u201318}} After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 [[Jews]] to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}} Unexploded German bombs continue to be unearthed in the 21st century.{{sfn|Nikolic 28 July 2015}}\n\nL\u00f6hr was captured by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] on 9 May 1945, escaped, and was recaptured on 13 May. He was intensively interrogated, after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on war crimes charges, one of which related to his command of ''Luftflotte'' IV during Operation Retribution. L\u00f6hr was convicted by the Yugoslav military court and sentenced to death.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=756\u2013757}} He was executed on 26 February 1947.{{sfn|Barbier|2017|p=155}} Following the invasion, Kren was appointed head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske}}, ZNDH). He was arrested in Italy in March 1947 and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried on unrelated charges of war crimes for his role in the targeting of civilians by the ZNDH. He was found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948.{{sfn|Go\u00f1i|2002|p=236}}\n\nThe bombing of Belgrade was depicted in the 1980 Yugoslav feature film ''[[Who's Singin' Over There?]]'' ({{lang-sh|Ko to tamo peva|link=no}}) and the 1995 feature film ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' ({{lang-sh|Podzemlje|link=no}}).{{sfn|Goulding|2002|pp=167\u2013168, 186}} It is also the subject of [[Miodrag Pavlovi\u0107]]'s poem ''Belgrade 1941'' ({{lang-sh|Beograd 1941|link=no}}).{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=124}} The [[Serbian American]] poet [[Charles Simic]], a survivor of the bombing, wrote a poem titled ''Cameo Appearance'' recounting his experiences.{{sfn|Forhan|2008|pp=255\u2013256}} A monument commemorating the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution was inaugurated in [[New Belgrade]] on 6 April 1997.

Christopher Chant states that the codename was ''Unternehmen Bestrafung'' (Operation Punishment).{{sfn|Chant|1986|p=17}} [[Martin Gilbert]], a historian specialising in the [[Holocaust]], writes that the operation was codenamed ''[[wikt:castigo|Castigo]]'' (\"punishment\").{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=170}} The historian Vladimir Terzi\u0107 offers the [[Serbo-Croatian]] translation, ''Kazna'' (\"punishment\").{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}|group=lower-alpha}} was the April 1941 [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] of [[Belgrade]], the capital of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], in retaliation for the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] that overthrew the government that had signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] (VVKJ) had only 77 modern [[fighter aircraft]] available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and [[bomber]]s that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets and divulging the VVKJ's codes.\n\nThree more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The bombing of Belgrade was preceded by the commencement of the ground invasion a few hours earlier, and coincided with air attacks on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the [[National Library of Serbia]], which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the [[Belgrade Zoo]].\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] carried out two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], in retaliation for the attacks on Yugoslavia, which ultimately surrendered on 17 April. The senior [[Luftwaffe]] officer responsible for the bombing, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948. A monument erected in [[New Belgrade]] in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defense. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.\n\n==Background==\n===Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat===\n{{main|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|Tripartite Pact}}\nFollowing [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] political pressure as her neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] when that country [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]]. Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] also joined the Pact.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their [[client state]]s, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] to [[Berchtesgaden]], and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 1 March, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}}\n\nFurther pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} On 6 March, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=13}} On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|complied]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]] officers, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Borivoje Mirkovi\u0107]], deposed Prince Paul in a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=43\u201344}} He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], who was declared to be of age to accede to the throne.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}\n\n===Preparations===\n{{main|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe day of the coup, Hitler issued [[Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]], which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the [[Balkans]]. He ordered that \"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler decided that [[Belgrade]] would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (''Unternehmen Strafgericht''). On 27 and 28 March 1941, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' IV]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (General) [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L\u00f6hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}} Although Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, at the last minute L\u00f6hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}}\n\nOn 3 April, [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] defected to the Germans, flying a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to [[Graz]] in Austria, and disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} On the afternoon of 5 April, a British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] visited Mirkovi\u0107 at the VVKJ base in [[Zemun]] and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the following morning.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an [[open city]] in the event of hostilities. Although the German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \"Fortress Belgrade\" after the first bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}}\n\nBy 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern [[medium bomber]]s. Other than a small number of locally made [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}} The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E-3a fighters, 15 [[Hawker Hurricane]] MkIs, and six Rogo\u017earski IK-3s.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n==Bombing==\n{{also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016226-0005A, Belgrad, Altes Schloss, Sch\u00e4den.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The bomb-damaged [[Stari dvor|Old Palace]] in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941.|alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background]]\nGerman ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]], ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' [[Joseph Goebbels]], announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}} The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with [[Easter]] Sunday as observed by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which uses the [[Julian calendar]].{{sfn|Zaki\u0107|2017|p=64}} Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based ''Fliegerf\u00fchrer'' Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=196}}\n\nThe first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers, and 160 [[Heinkel He 111]] medium bombers and [[Dornier Do 17]] [[light bomber]]s at {{convert|8000|-|10000|ft|m}}. They were escorted by [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] [[heavy fighter]]s at {{convert|11000|-|12000|ft|m}} and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=195}} The entire Yugoslav 6th Fighter Brigade, consisting of the 51st Fighter Group at Zemun and the 32nd Fighter Group at [[Prnjavor (Belgrade)#Boroughs|Prnjavor]], totalling 29 Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and five Rogo\u017earski IK-3s, were scrambled to intercept the Germans.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013197}} The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG 77). Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at [[Kni\u0107]] arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one ''Stuka'' shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013198}} On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the [[General Post Office, Belgrade|post office]] including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Supreme Command]] building, the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|military academy]], the [[Royal Compound, Belgrade|royal palace at Dedinje]], the royal guard barracks at [[Top\u010dider]], the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}}\n\nImmediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters. They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at [[Kragujevac]], acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n[[File:Bombed National Library Belgrad.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A 2008 photograph of the ruins of the National Library of Serbia, bombed on 6 April 1941|alt=an overgrown crater with ruined walls around part of the perimeter]]\nBelgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, consisting of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near [[Vienna]], escorted by 60 fighters. This wave was met by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, which claimed four German aircraft. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n\nThe Germans claimed nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April. Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged. The Yugoslavs claimed to have shot down twenty-two German aircraft and forced two others to land. The Germans lost twelve aircraft, significantly fewer than claimed by the Yugoslavs: two Do 17Z light bombers, five Bf 110 heavy fighters, four Ju 87 dive bombers, and one Bf 109E fighter.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' [[Gerhard Koall]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} He went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in 1944.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=216}}\n\nGerman bombers and dive-bombers dropped {{convert|215|-|360|LT|ST}} of [[aerial bomb|bombs]] and [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]] on the capital.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}}{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=194}} The weak VVKJ and inadequate anti-aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault, but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack. Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders. A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft, downed 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on the ground.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}} The military historian Daniel L. Zajac writes that the Germans lost 40 aircraft during the two-day air battle.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} Another source indicates the loss of 14 German aircraft on 6 April.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=200\u2013208}} Dive-bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}}\n\nAccording to the historian [[Stevan K. Pavlowitch]], the bombing of Belgrade lasted three days.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the [[National Library of Serbia]], which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of rare books, maps, and [[medieval]] manuscripts were destroyed.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=41}} Also struck was the [[Belgrade Zoo]], sending frightened animals running through the streets.{{sfn|Freeman|2008|p=94}}\n\n==British retaliation==\n[[No. 37 Squadron RAF|No. 37 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) conducted two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. Operating [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from an airfield in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], the squadron conducted raids on 6/7 April and 12/13 April, dropping a total of {{convert|30|LT|ST}} of high-explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941. The historian Herman Knell calls the retaliatory justification for these raids \"strange and implausible\".{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=195}} The aviation historians Shores, Cull and Malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on the lines of communication of German forces attacking Greece and Yugoslavia, and note that the raid on 6/7 April targeted an ammunition train and other installations in Sofia, and the raid on 12/13 April bombed the railway marshalling yards. Other similar targets in Bulgaria were attacked by the RAF during the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=232, 243}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Spomenik pilotima 1941.JPG|thumb|200px|Monument to the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution, located in [[New Belgrade]]|alt=rectangular polished dark stone plinth pointing toward the sky, with a winged plaque and inscription at the base]]\nThe bombing of Belgrade paralyzed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters, and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Civilian casualties were significant, but sources vary widely from 1,500 to 17,000 killed.{{sfn|Knell|2009|pp=194\u2013195}} They were worsened by the disclosure of air-raid shelter locations to the Germans in the days preceding the attack.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} The official casualty figure released by the occupation authorities soon after the bombing was 2,271 killed. Other sources mention 5,000 to 10,000 fatalities, and later Yugoslav estimates ranged even higher.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=16}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=18}} The historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following \"careful postwar investigations\", and indicates that a figure between 3,000 and 4,000 is more realistic.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=74}}\n\nBelgrade was occupied on 13 April 1941, and four days later, Yugoslavia capitulated.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=19}} Afterwards, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that {{convert|218.5|MT}} of bombs were dropped, 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped, and that areas in the centre and northwest of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of the aerial mines.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Significant damage was done to Belgrade, particularly to the water and electrical systems.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=17\u201318}} After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 [[Jews]] to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}} Unexploded German bombs continue to be unearthed in the 21st century.{{sfn|Nikolic 28 July 2015}}\n\nL\u00f6hr was captured by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] on 9 May 1945, escaped, and was recaptured on 13 May. He was intensively interrogated, after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on war crimes charges, one of which related to his command of ''Luftflotte'' IV during Operation Retribution. L\u00f6hr was convicted by the Yugoslav military court and sentenced to death.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=756\u2013757}} He was executed on 26 February 1947.{{sfn|Barbier|2017|p=155}} Following the invasion, Kren was appointed head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr\u017eave Hrvatske}}, ZNDH). He was arrested in Italy in March 1947 and extradited to Yugoslavia, where he was tried on unrelated charges of war crimes for his role in the targeting of civilians by the ZNDH. He was found guilty on all counts and executed in 1948.{{sfn|Go\u00f1i|2002|p=236}}\n\nThe bombing of Belgrade was depicted in the 1980 Yugoslav feature film ''[[Who's Singin' Over There?]]'' ({{lang-sh|Ko to tamo peva|link=no}}) and the 1995 feature film ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' ({{lang-sh|Podzemlje|link=no}}).{{sfn|Goulding|2002|pp=167\u2013168, 186}} It is also the subject of [[Miodrag Pavlovi\u0107]]'s poem ''Belgrade 1941'' ({{lang-sh|Beograd 1941|link=no}}).{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=124}} The [[Serbian American]] poet [[Charles Simic]], a survivor of the bombing, wrote a poem titled ''Cameo Appearance'' recounting his experiences.{{sfn|Forhan|2008|pp=255\u2013256}} A monument commemorating the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution was inaugurated in [[New Belgrade]] on 6 April 1997.

A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first media appearance with bandmate [[Han Geng]] as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.\n\nChoi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group ''Super Junior 05'' on 6 November 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' music program ''[[Inkigayo|Popular Songs]]'', performing their first single, \"[[Knockout (Triple 8 song)#Super Junior version|Twins (Knock Out)]]\". Their debut album ''[[Twins (Super Junior album)|Twins]]'' was released a month later on 5 December 2005 and debuted at number three  on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.\n\nIn March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. Following the addition of thirteenth member [[Cho Kyu-hyun|Kyuhyun]], the group dropped the suffix \"05\" and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \"[[U (Super Junior song)#Super Junior-M's cover|U]]\" on 8 April 2008. This was followed by the release of the debut Chinese-language [[studio album]], ''[[Me (Super Junior-M album)|Me]]'' in selected provinces in China on 23 April and 2 May in Taiwan.\n\n===Acting career===\nIn 2006, Choi was cast in the Hong Kong [[epic film]] ''[[A Battle of Wits (2006 film)|A Battle of Wits]]'', playing the role of the Liang Prince.

The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry.
