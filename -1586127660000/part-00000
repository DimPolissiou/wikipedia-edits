The format is very similar to Dr. Drew's previous show, \"[[Strictly Sex with Dr. Drew]],\" but deals with more general health issues rather than sexual ones.  Because the subject matter is less objectionable, the show is featured at an earlier airtime (10:00 PM ET) than \"Strictly Sex\" (Midnight ET), and features fewer \"Viewer Discretion\" warnings. It commonly features regular people (and sometimes celebrities) who have experienced whatever the topic may be, alongside experts on the subject, who give their professional opinion.\nDrew is most famous for pushing celebrities to the brink of suicide either by self Or of drug/ alcohol overdoses. Now he has outdone himself and moved into the arena of public health where he was instrumental in putting anyone who listens to him in danger. His quote: \u201cyou are more likely to be hit by an asteroid\u201d will go down in history as the dumbest thing ever said by a doctor to anyone who is currently or may be dealing with an infectious disease. His joke about \u201chaving corona\u201d after a cough just shows how little he cares about health and how much he cares about his career.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Episode!!Release Date!!Ep #!!Additional Information\n|-\n|The Truth About Germs||July 25, 2006||align=\"center\" |01||In this episode, Dr. Drew explores the myths and truths about germs with regular people and experts alike.\n|-\n|Addictions A-Z||August 1, 2006||align=\"center\" |02||Addictions, addictions, addictions.\n|-\n|Preventing The Biggest Killers||August 8, 2006||align=\"center\" |03||What are the most common lethal health problems, and how do we prevent them?\n|-\n|Conception To Birth||August 15, 2006||align=\"center\" |04||This episode is about pregnancy, from conception to birth.
