According to fantasy-fans as a whole, the subgenre consists, namely, of contemporary or modern fantasy pieces set in the Victorian \"gaslamp\" era. However, the subgenre also includes some works with a pre-Victorian setting ([[Susanna Clarke]]'s [[British Regency|Regency]] novel ''[[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell]]'', for example). More samplings of the genre can be found in publications such as the ''[[Gaslight Grimoire]]'' anthologies and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' comics.\n\n==Origin==\n{{Fantasy}}\nThe term \"gaslamp fantasy\" was first coined on April 26, 2006, by webcomic artist Kaja Foglio to differentiate her comic, ''[[Girl Genius]]'', from conventional steampunk fiction.\n\n{{quote |text = I called it Gaslamp Fantasy because, around the time we were bringing Girl Genius out, there was a comic called Steampunk on the shelves and I didn't want any confusion. Plus, I've never liked the term steampunk much for our work, it's derived from cyberpunk  (a term which I think actually fits its genre well) but we have no punk, and we have more than just steam, and using a different name seemed appropriate. I mis-remembered a term that I had come across in the foreword to an H. Rider Haggard book, where the author was talking about Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Rider Haggard and that sort of pre-pulp adventure material, and came up with \"Gaslamp Fantasy.\" I felt a bit foolish when I discovered that I had made up my own term, but it works and I like it.|author=Kaja Foglio, author of ''Girl Genius''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kajafoglio.livejournal.com/60562.html |title=Dirt, Collection Vol. 5, Furniture and Gaslamp Fantasy |last=Foglio |first=Kaja |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2008-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313103808/http://kajafoglio.livejournal.com/60562.html |archivedate=2007-03-13 }}</ref>}}\n\n''Girl Genius'', although science fiction set in nineteenth-century Europe, does not have a firm emphasis on fantastic [[Industrial Revolution]] technology. Elements of other types of fiction are featured, including magic and mythical creatures, and the scientific element of it is less prominent. It also includes steampunk takes on contemporary sci-fi biology elements, like clockwork cyborgs, mass-produced Frankenstein-type creatures, and other monsters.\n\nGenerally, the term refers to fiction based in a Victorian-style setting, similar to steampunk, but with a broader emphasis. The stories are usually not so focused on machinery of the period (or, often, any machinery at all), take more liberties with the actual time period, and may contain elements of other genres.\n\nSince the term's coining, gaslamp fantasy has been retroactively applied to other fiction written in the Victorian Age, such as the works of [[Bram Stoker]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Example farm|section|date=September 2009}}\n\n===Novels===\n*'''[[Emma Bull]]''': ''Territory'' \u2013 a fantasy depiction of Tombstone, Arizona during the OK Corral era circa 1881, featuring Wyatt Earp \u2013 brother to the Deputy US Marshal, [[Virgil Earp]] \u2013 as a black magician, a Chinese physician\n*'''[[Elizabeth Bear]]'''\n*'''[[Galen Beckett]]''': (The Lockwell Sisters) ''The Magicians and Mrs. Quent'' (2008), ''The House on Durrow Street'' (2010), and ''The Master of Heathcrest Hall'' (2012)\n*'''[[Rick Boyer]]''': ''The Giant Rat of Sumatra'' (1976)\n*'''[[Gordon Dahlquist]]'s''' ''[[The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters]]'' (2006) and its two sequels.

More samplings of the genre can be found in publications such as the ''[[Gaslight Grimoire]]'' anthologies and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' comics.\n\n==Origin==\n{{Fantasy}}\nThe term \"gaslamp fantasy\" was first coined on April 26, 2006, by webcomic artist Kaja Foglio to differentiate her comic, ''[[Girl Genius]]'', from conventional steampunk fiction.\n\n{{quote |text = I called it Gaslamp Fantasy because, around the time we were bringing Girl Genius out, there was a comic called Steampunk on the shelves and I didn't want any confusion. Plus, I've never liked the term steampunk much for our work, it's derived from cyberpunk  (a term which I think actually fits its genre well) but we have no punk, and we have more than just steam, and using a different name seemed appropriate. I mis-remembered a term that I had come across in the foreword to an H. Rider Haggard book, where the author was talking about Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Rider Haggard and that sort of pre-pulp adventure material, and came up with \"Gaslamp Fantasy.\" I felt a bit foolish when I discovered that I had made up my own term, but it works and I like it.|author=Kaja Foglio, author of ''Girl Genius''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kajafoglio.livejournal.com/60562.html |title=Dirt, Collection Vol. 5, Furniture and Gaslamp Fantasy |last=Foglio |first=Kaja |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2008-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313103808/http://kajafoglio.livejournal.com/60562.html |archivedate=2007-03-13 }}</ref>}}\n\n''Girl Genius'', although science fiction set in nineteenth-century Europe, does not have a firm emphasis on fantastic [[Industrial Revolution]] technology. Elements of other types of fiction are featured, including magic and mythical creatures, and the scientific element of it is less prominent. It also includes steampunk takes on contemporary sci-fi biology elements, like clockwork cyborgs, mass-produced Frankenstein-type creatures, and other monsters.\n\nGenerally, the term refers to fiction based in a Victorian-style setting, similar to steampunk, but with a broader emphasis. The stories are usually not so focused on machinery of the period (or, often, any machinery at all), take more liberties with the actual time period, and may contain elements of other genres.\n\nSince the term's coining, gaslamp fantasy has been retroactively applied to other fiction written in the Victorian Age, such as the works of [[Bram Stoker]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]].\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Example farm|section|date=September 2009}}\n\n===Novels===\n*'''[[Emma Bull]]''': ''Territory'' \u2013 a fantasy depiction of Tombstone, Arizona during the OK Corral era circa 1881, featuring Wyatt Earp \u2013 brother to the Deputy US Marshal, [[Virgil Earp]] \u2013 as a black magician, a Chinese physician\n*'''[[Elizabeth Bear]]'''\n*'''[[Galen Beckett]]''': (The Lockwell Sisters) ''The Magicians and Mrs. Quent'' (2008), ''The House on Durrow Street'' (2010), and ''The Master of Heathcrest Hall'' (2012)\n*'''[[Rick Boyer]]''': ''The Giant Rat of Sumatra'' (1976)\n*'''[[Gordon Dahlquist]]'s''' ''[[The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters]]'' (2006) and its two sequels.

Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the [[Middle Ages]] it referred to the right to ''pull up'' fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\n\nThe municipality had a total population of {{Swiss populations|CH-ZG|1711}} in {{Swiss populations date|CH-ZG}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-ZG}} The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stumpf-Chronik-Zug.png|thumb|View of Zug before 1547]]\n[[File:Zug - Unterstadt - Zugersee IMG 2606.JPG|thumb|''Unterstadt'' (lower town) as seen from [[Lake Zug]] harbour]]\n[[File:Zug - Oberstadt IMG 2611.jpg|thumb|''Oberstadt'' (upper town) in the [[Altstadt]]]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives).

Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the [[Middle Ages]] it referred to the right to ''pull up'' fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\n\nThe municipality had a total population of {{Swiss populations|CH-ZG|1711}} in {{Swiss populations date|CH-ZG}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-ZG}} The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stumpf-Chronik-Zug.png|thumb|View of Zug before 1547]]\n[[File:Zug - Unterstadt - Zugersee IMG 2606.JPG|thumb|''Unterstadt'' (lower town) as seen from [[Lake Zug]] harbour]]\n[[File:Zug - Oberstadt IMG 2611.jpg|thumb|''Oberstadt'' (upper town) in the [[Altstadt]]]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives). The rest of the sites are the Catholic Church of St. Oswald with [[Charnel house]], the [[Seminary]] of St. Michael, the town walls and several buildings in the old town of Zug.<ref>[http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501142322/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html |date=1 May 2009 }} 21.11.2008 version, {{in lang|de}} accessed 22-Sep-2009</ref>\n\nThe prehistoric settlements at Oterswil/Insel Eielen, Riedmatt and Sumpf are part of the [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]] a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]].<ref name=UNESCO>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/ UNESCO World Heritage Site - Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Zug education system is based on equal abilities and includes compulsory primary and secondary school, with optional secondary education and vocational training. Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

Electricians sometimes attach a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and a [[doorbell]] or [[buzzer]] to two fish tapes so that when the ends of the tapes make contact with each other (within the wall), the bell rings.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hand tools}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical hand tools]]\n", "name_user": "2605:a000:1222:43c7:3184:4cae:38c8:3017", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(spelling errors)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_tape"}

The diamond was part of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[Peacock Throne]]. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to [[Queen Victoria]] after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British annexation]] of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.\n\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] diamonds, like the [[Darya-i-Noor]], which are now in the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. In 1851, it went on display at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by [[Coster Diamonds]]. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemologists as \"full of life\".<ref>Howie, p. 293.</ref>\n\nBecause its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the [[British royal family]] for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it.<!--cited end of paragraph--> Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family.<ref>Mears, et al., p. 27.</ref> Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]], wife of [[Edward VII]]. It was transferred to the [[Crown of Queen Mary]] in 1911, and finally to the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Crown of Queen Elizabeth]] (later known as the Queen Mother) in 1937 for her coronation as Queen consort.\n\nToday, the diamond is on public display in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]], where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership of the Koh-i-Noor and demanded its return ever since India gained independence from the UK in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lahore#Text of the 1849 Last Treaty of Lahore|Last Treaty of Lahore]] and has rejected the claims.<!-- all cited within article body -->\n\n== History ==\n=== Origin ===\nThe diamond may have been mined from [[Kollur Mine]],<ref>Fanthorpe, p. 202.</ref><ref>Mears (1988), p. 100.</ref> a series of {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} deep [[Gravel pit|gravel-clay pits]] on the banks of [[Krishna River]] in the [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]] (present-day <!--It is in Andhra Pradesh not Telangana-->[[Andhra Pradesh]]<!--It is not in Telangana-->), [[India]].<ref>Kurien, p. 112.</ref> It is impossible to know exactly when or where it was found, and many unverifiable theories exist as to its original owner.<ref name=\"rose32\">Rose, p. 32.</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Babur]], the [[Turco-Mongol]] founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], wrote about a \"famous\" diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats \u2013&nbsp;approximately the size of the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Streeter, pp. 116\u2013117, 130.</ref> Some historians think Babur's diamond is the earliest reliable reference to the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Lafont, p. 48.</ref> According to his diary, it was acquired by [[Alauddin Khalji]], second ruler of the [[Khalji dynasty]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], when he [[Alauddin Khalji#Marwar and southern campaigns, 1307\u20131313|invaded the kingdoms of southern India]] at the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century and was probably in the possession of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |title=India Before Europe |last1=Asher |first1=Catherine B. |last2=Talbot |first2=Cynthia |date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52180-904-7 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC&pg=PA40# |accessdate=20 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> It later passed to succeeding dynasties of the Sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] at the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].<ref name=\"rose32\"/>\n\n[[Shah Jahan]], the fifth Mughal emperor, had the stone placed into his ornate [[Peacock Throne]].

After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja. Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond's value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was \"far beyond all computation\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=83}} Ranjit Singh then fixed the diamond in the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=83-84}} He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as [[Diwali]] and [[Dusserah]], and took it with him during travel. He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}}\n\nOne day, Ranjit Singh asked the diamond's former owners - Shuja and his wife Wafa Begum - to estimate its value. Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the [[Gobindgarh Fort]] when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a [[pannier]] on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}} Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=106}}\n\nIn June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third [[stroke]], and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son [[Kharak Singh]] as his successor. A day before his death, on 26 June 1839, a major argument broke out between his courtiers regarding the fate of Koh-i-Noor.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=91}} Ranjit Singh himself was too weak to speak, and communicated using gestures. Bhai Gobind Ram, the head [[Brahmin]] of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]]: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle ''Umdat ul-Tawarikh''.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=91-92}} However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh's personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=92}}\n\nAfter Ranjit Singh's death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=107}} Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and prime minister [[Dhian Singh]] also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=108}}\n\n=== In Gulab Singh's possession ===\nOn 8 October 1839 the new emperor Kharak Singh, was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh.

Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (''sic'')\".<ref>Login, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief [[Tej Singh]], a loyalist of Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].\n\nThe [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain. Although some thought it should have been presented as a gift to Queen Victoria by the East India Company, it is clear that Dalhousie believed the stone was a spoil of war, and treated it accordingly, ensuring that it was officially surrendered to her by [[Duleep Singh]], the youngest son of Ranjit Singh.<ref>Broun-Ramsay, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor by the East India Company to the queen was the latest in a long history of transfers of the diamond as a coveted spoil of war.<ref name=\"keay\">Keay, pp. 156\u2013158</ref> Duleep Singh had been placed in the guardianship of Dr John Login, a surgeon in the British Army serving in the [[Presidency of Bengal]].

It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F. Mackeson under tight security arrangements, one of which was the placement of the dispatch box in a larger iron safe. They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS ''Medea'', captained by Captain Lockyer.\n\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of [[cholera]] on board when the ship was in [[Mauritius]] had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.\n\nOn arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in [[Plymouth]], but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached [[Spithead]], near [[Portsmouth]], on 1 July.

After consulting mineralogists, including Sir [[David Brewster]], it was decided by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of Queen Victoria, with the consent of the government, to polish the Koh-i-Noor. One of the largest and most famous Dutch diamond merchants, [[Coster Diamonds|Mozes Coster]], was employed for the task.

In his preface to the first edition of the book, Collins says that he based his eponymous \"Moonstone\" on the histories of two stones: the [[Orlov (diamond)|Orlov]], a {{convert|189.62|carat|g|1|adj=on}} diamond in the Russian Imperial Sceptre, and the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilkie Collins|title=The Moonstone: A Novel|url=https://archive.org/details/moonstoneanovel00collgoog|year=1874|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=[https://archive.org/details/moonstoneanovel00collgoog/page/n14 8]}}</ref> In the 1966 [[Penguin Books]] edition of ''The Moonstone'', [[J.

The diamond was part of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[Peacock Throne]]. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to [[Queen Victoria]] after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British annexation]] of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.\n\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] diamonds, like the [[Darya-i-Noor]], which are now in the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. In 1851, it went on display at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by [[Coster Diamonds]]. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemologists as \"full of life\".<ref>Howie, p. 293.</ref>\n\nBecause its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the [[British royal family]] for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it.<!--cited end of paragraph--> Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family.<ref>Mears, et al., p. 27.</ref> Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]], wife of [[Edward VII]]. It was transferred to the [[Crown of Queen Mary]] in 1911, and finally to the [[Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Crown of Queen Elizabeth]] (later known as the Queen Mother) in 1937 for her coronation as Queen consort.\n\nToday, the diamond is on public display in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]], where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership of the Koh-i-Noor and demanded its return ever since India gained independence from the UK in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the [[Treaty of Lahore#Text of the 1849 Last Treaty of Lahore|Last Treaty of Lahore]] and has rejected the claims.<!-- all cited within article body -->\n\n== History ==\n=== Origin ===\nThe diamond may have been mined from [[Kollur Mine]],<ref>Fanthorpe, p. 202.</ref><ref>Mears (1988), p. 100.</ref> a series of {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} deep [[Gravel pit|gravel-clay pits]] on the banks of [[Krishna River]] in the [[Golconda Sultanate|Golconda]] (present-day <!--It is in Andhra Pradesh not Telangana-->[[Andhra Pradesh]]<!--It is not in Telangana-->), [[India]].<ref>Kurien, p. 112.</ref> It is impossible to know exactly when or where it was found, and many unverifiable theories exist as to its original owner.<ref name=\"rose32\">Rose, p. 32.</ref>\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Babur]], the [[Turco-Mongol]] founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], wrote about a \"famous\" diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats \u2013&nbsp;approximately the size of the 186-carat Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Streeter, pp. 116\u2013117, 130.</ref> Some historians think Babur's diamond is the earliest reliable reference to the Koh-i-Noor.<ref>Lafont, p. 48.</ref> According to his diary, it was acquired by [[Alauddin Khalji]], second ruler of the [[Khalji dynasty]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], when he [[Alauddin Khalji#Marwar and southern campaigns, 1307\u20131313|invaded the kingdoms of southern India]] at the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century and was probably in the possession of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |title=India Before Europe |last1=Asher |first1=Catherine B. |last2=Talbot |first2=Cynthia |date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52180-904-7 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvaGuaJIJgoC&pg=PA40# |accessdate=20 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> It later passed to succeeding dynasties of the Sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] at the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].<ref name=\"rose32\"/>\n\n[[Shah Jahan]], the fifth Mughal emperor, had the stone placed into his ornate [[Peacock Throne]].

After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja. Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond's value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was \"far beyond all computation\".{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=83}} Ranjit Singh then fixed the diamond in the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=83-84}} He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as [[Diwali]] and [[Dusserah]], and took it with him during travel. He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}}\n\nOne day, Ranjit Singh asked the diamond's former owners - Shuja and his wife Wafa Begum - to estimate its value. Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the [[Gobindgarh Fort]] when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a [[pannier]] on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}} Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=106}}\n\nIn June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third [[stroke]], and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son [[Kharak Singh]] as his successor. A day before his death, on 26 June 1839, a major argument broke out between his courtiers regarding the fate of Koh-i-Noor.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=91}} Ranjit Singh himself was too weak to speak, and communicated using gestures. Bhai Gobind Ram, the head [[Brahmin]] of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]]: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle ''Umdat ul-Tawarikh''.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=91-92}} However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh's personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=92}}\n\nAfter Ranjit Singh's death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=107}} Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and prime minister [[Dhian Singh]] also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=108}}\n\n=== In Gulab Singh's possession ===\nOn 8 October 1839 the new emperor Kharak Singh, was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh.

Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (''sic'')\".<ref>Login, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief [[Tej Singh]], a loyalist of Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].\n\nThe [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain.

G. Mansel, [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]] and Sir Henry Elliot (Secretary to the Government of India).\n\nLegend in the Lawrence family has it that before the voyage, John Lawrence left the jewel in his waistcoat pocket when it was sent to be laundered, and was most grateful when it was returned promptly by the [[valet]] who found it.<ref name=\"Birdwood1946\">{{cite book|author=William Riddell Birdwood|title=In My Time: Recollections and Anecdotes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GwgAAAAMAAJ|year=1946|publisher=Skeffington & Son|page=85}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 February 1850, the jewel was sealed in a small iron safe inside a red dispatch box, both sealed with red tape and a wax seal and kept in a chest at Bombay Treasury awaiting a steamer ship from China. It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F. Mackeson under tight security arrangements, one of which was the placement of the dispatch box in a larger iron safe. They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS ''Medea'', captained by Captain Lockyer.\n\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of [[cholera]] on board when the ship was in [[Mauritius]] had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.\n\nOn arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in [[Plymouth]], but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached [[Spithead]], near [[Portsmouth]], on 1 July. The next morning, Ramsay and Mackeson, in the company of Mr Onslow, the private secretary to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the British East India Company, proceeded by train to [[East India House]] in the [[City of London]] and passed the diamond into the care of the chairman and deputy chairman of the East India Company.\n\nThe Koh-i-Noor was formally presented to Queen Victoria on 3 July 1850 at [[Buckingham Palace]] by the deputy chairman of the East India Company.<ref name=\"keay\"/> The date had been chosen to coincide with the Company's 250th anniversary.<ref>Tarshis, p. 138.</ref>\n\n=== The Great Exhibition ===\n[[File:Kohinoor.jpg|thumb|In the armlet given to Victoria]]\nMembers of the public were given a chance to see the Koh-i-Noor when [[The Great Exhibition]] was staged at [[Hyde Park, London]], in 1851.

After consulting mineralogists, including Sir [[David Brewster]], it was decided by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of Queen Victoria, with the consent of the government, to polish the Koh-i-Noor. One of the largest and most famous Dutch diamond merchants, [[Coster Diamonds|Mozes Coster]], was employed for the task.

It was the opening battle of the war.]]\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n\nHistorians debating the '''origins of the [[American Civil War]]''' focus on the reasons why [[Southern United States|seven Southern states]] (followed by [[Upper South|four more]] after the onset of the war) declared their secession from the [[United States]] ([[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]]), why they united to form the [[Confederate States of America]] (simply known as the \"Confederacy\"), and why the North refused to let them go. While virtually all historians in the 21st century agree that conflicts over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] caused the war, they disagree sharply regarding which kinds of conflict\u2014ideological, economic, political, or social\u2014were most important.<ref>Aaron Sheehan-Dean, \"A Book for Every Perspective: Current Civil War and Reconstruction Textbooks,\" ''Civil War History'' (2005) 51#3 pp 317\u2013324</ref>\n\nThe primary catalyst for secession was slavery, most immediately the political battle over the right of Southerners to bring slavery into western territory that had hitherto been free under the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]] or [[Mexican\u2013American War|while part of Mexico]]. Another factor for secession and the formation of the Confederacy, was [[White Southerners|white Southern nationalism]].<ref>John McCardell, ''The Idea of a Southern Nation: Southern Nationalists and Southern Nationalism, 1830\u20131860'' (1981)</ref> The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union, a cause based on [[American nationalism]].<ref>Susan-Mary Grant, ''North Over South: Northern Nationalism and American Identity in the Antebellum Era'' (2000)</ref> Most of the debate is about the first question, as to why some Southern states decided to secede.\n\n[[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]] without being on the ballot in ten Southern states. His victory triggered declarations of [[Secession in the United States|secession]] by seven [[Slave and free states|slave states]] of the [[Deep South]], whose riverfront or coastal economies were all based on cotton cultivated using slave labor. They formed the Confederate States of America after Lincoln was elected, but before he [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|took office]]. Nationalists in the North and \"Unionists\" in the South refused to recognize the declarations of secession. No foreign government ever recognized the Confederacy. The U.S. government under President [[James Buchanan]] refused to relinquish its forts that were in territory claimed by the Confederacy. The war itself began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces bombarded]] [[Fort Sumter]], a major U.S. fortress in the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]].\n\nAs a panel of historians emphasized in 2011, \"while slavery and its various and multifaceted discontents were the primary cause of disunion, it was disunion itself that sparked the war.\"<ref>[[Elizabeth R.

Thus they were committed to values that could not logically be reconciled.\"<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis'', page 45 (This book won the Pulitzer Prize for History)</ref> Other important factors were [[Second Party System|partisan politics]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]] vs [[Secession in the United States|secession]], Southern and Northern nationalism, [[Manifest Destiny|expansionism]], [[Panic of 1857|economics]], and modernization in the [[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] period.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Geography and demographics==\nThe United States had become a nation of two distinct regions.

Their growth was fed by a high birth rate and large numbers of European immigrants, especially British, Irish and Germans. The South was dominated by a settled [[Plantation economy|plantation system]] based on slavery; there was some rapid growth taking place in the Southwest (e.g., [[Texas]]), based on high birth rates and high migration from the Southeast; there was also immigration by Europeans, but in much smaller number. The heavily rural South had few cities of any size, and little manufacturing except in border areas such as [[St. Louis]] and [[Baltimore]]. Slave owners controlled politics and the economy, although about 75% of white Southern families owned no slaves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Boyer|title=The Enduring Vision, Volume I: To 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqawVJRMd8YC&pg=PA343|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=343|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:US Secession map 1861.svg|thumb|300px|right|1861 United States Secession Crisis map.<br>Legend:\n{{legend|#A40000| States that seceded before April 15, 1861}}\n\n{{legend|#EF2929| States that seceded after April 15, 1861}}\n\n{{legend|#FCE94F| States that permitted slavery, but did not secede}}\n\n{{legend|#204A87| States of the Union that banned slavery}}\n\n{{legend|#D3D7CF| U.S. territories, under [[Union Army]] control}}|alt=1861 Map of U.S. states and territories showing two phases of secession]]\nOverall, the Northern population was growing much more quickly than the Southern population, which made it increasingly difficult for the South to continue to influence the national government. By the time the 1860 election occurred, the heavily agricultural southern states as a group had fewer [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes than the rapidly [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] northern states. Abraham Lincoln was able to win the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]] without even being on the ballot in ten Southern states. Southerners felt a loss of federal concern for Southern pro-slavery political demands, and their continued domination of the federal government was threatened. This political calculus provided a very real basis for Southerners' worry about the relative political decline of their region, due to the North growing much faster in terms of population and industrial output.\n\nIn the interest of maintaining unity, politicians had mostly moderated opposition to slavery, resulting in numerous compromises such as the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 under the presidency of [[James Monroe]]. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846 to 1848, the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the new [[Historic regions of the United States|territories]] led to the [[Compromise of 1850]]. While the compromise averted an immediate political crisis, it did not permanently resolve the issue of the [[Slave Power]] (the power of slaveholders to control the national government on the slavery issue). Part of the Compromise of 1850 was the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which many Northerners found to be extremely offensive, and required that Northerners assist Southerners in reclaiming fugitive slaves.\n\nAmid the emergence of increasingly virulent and hostile sectional ideologies in national politics, the collapse of the old [[Second Party System]] in the 1850s hampered politicians' efforts to reach yet another compromise. The compromise that was reached (the 1854 [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]) outraged many Northerners, and led to the formation of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the first major party that was almost entirely Northern-based. The industrializing North and agrarian Midwest became committed to the economic ethos of free-labor [[industrial capitalism]].\n\nArguments that slavery was undesirable for the nation had long existed, and early in U.S. history were made even by some prominent Southerners. After 1840, abolitionists denounced slavery as not only a social evil but a moral wrong. Activists in the new Republican Party, usually Northerners, had another view: they believed the Slave Power conspiracy was controlling the national government with the goal of extending slavery.<ref name=\"Leonard L. Richards 2000\">Leonard L. Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780--1860'' (2000).</ref><ref>William E.

''Major Problems in the Civil War and Reconstruction: Documents and Essays'' (2010): 74.</ref> Southern defenders of slavery, for their part, increasingly came to contend that black people benefited from slavery.\n\n==Historical tensions and compromises==\n\n===Early Republic===\n{{See also|Three-fifths compromise|Hartford Convention}}\nAt the time of the American Revolution, the institution of slavery was firmly established in the American colonies. It was most important in the six southern states from Maryland to Georgia, but the total of a half million slaves were spread out through all of the colonies. In the South, 40% of the population was made up of slaves, and as Americans moved into Kentucky and the rest of the southwest, one-sixth of the settlers were slaves. By the end of the Revolutionary War, the [[New England]] states provided most of the American ships that were used in the foreign slave trade, while most of their customers were in Georgia and [[the Carolinas]].<ref>Fehrenbacher pp.15\u201317. Fehrenbacher wrote, \"As a racial caste system, slavery was the most distinctive element in the southern social order. The slave production of [[staple crop]]s dominated southern agriculture and eminently suited the development of a national market economy.\"</ref>\n\nDuring this time many Americans found it difficult to reconcile slavery with their interpretation of Christianity and the lofty sentiments that flowed from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. A small antislavery movement, led by the [[Quakers]], had some impact in the 1780s, and by the late 1780s all of the states except for Georgia had placed some restrictions on their participation in slave trafficking. Still, no serious national political movement against slavery developed, largely due to the overriding concern over achieving national unity.<ref>Fehrenbacher pp. 16\u201318</ref> When the Constitutional Convention met, slavery was the one issue \"that left the least possibility of compromise, the one that would most pit morality against pragmatism.\"<ref>Goldstone p. 13</ref> In the end, while many would take comfort in the fact that the word \"slavery\" never occurs in the Constitution, critics note that the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]] provided slaveholders with extra representatives in Congress, the requirement of the federal government to suppress domestic violence would dedicate national resources to defending against slave revolts, a twenty-year delay in banning the import of slaves allowed the South to fortify its labor needs, and the amendment process made the national abolition of slavery very unlikely in the foreseeable future.<ref>McDougall p. 318</ref>\n\nWith the outlawing of the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|African slave trade]] on January 1, 1808, many Americans felt that the slavery issue was resolved.<ref>Forbes p. 4</ref> Any national discussion that might have continued over slavery was drowned out by the years of trade embargoes, maritime competition with Great Britain and France, and, finally, the [[War of 1812]]. The one exception to this quiet regarding slavery was the New Englanders' association of their frustration with the war with their resentment of the three-fifths clause that seemed to allow the South to dominate national politics.<ref>Mason pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nDuring and in the aftermath of the American Revolution (1775\u20131783), the northern states (north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] separating Pennsylvania from Maryland and Delaware) abolished slavery by 1804, although in some states existing slaves were not liberated immediately. In the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, Congress (still under the [[Articles of Confederation]]) barred slavery from the Midwestern territory north of the [[Ohio River]], but when Congress organized the southern territories acquired through the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the ban on slavery was omitted.\n\n===Missouri Compromise===\n{{Main|Missouri Compromise}}\n\nIn 1819 Congressman [[James Tallmadge Jr.]] of New York initiated an uproar in the South when he proposed two amendments to a bill admitting [[Missouri]] to the Union as a free state. The first barred slaves from being moved to Missouri, and the second would free all Missouri slaves born after admission to the Union at age 25.<ref>Freehling p.144</ref> With the admission of Alabama as a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] in 1819, the U.S. was equally divided with 11 slave states and 11 free states. The admission of the new state of Missouri as a slave state would give the slave states a majority in the Senate; the [[Tallmadge Amendment]] would give the free states a majority.\n\nThe Tallmadge amendments passed the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate when five Northern senators voted with all the Southern senators.<ref>Freehling p. 149. In the House the votes for the Tallmadge amendments in the North were 86\u201310 and 80-14 in favor, while in the South the vote to oppose was 66\u20131 and 64-2.</ref> The question was now the admission of Missouri as a slave state, and many leaders shared [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s fear of a crisis over slavery\u2014a fear that Jefferson described as \"a fire bell in the night\". The crisis was solved by the [[Missouri Compromise]], in which [[Massachusetts]] agreed to cede control over its relatively large, sparsely populated and disputed [[exclave]], the [[District of Maine]]. The compromise allowed [[Maine]] to be admitted to the Union as a free state at the same time that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. The Compromise also banned slavery in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north and west of the state of Missouri along the line of 36\u201330. The Missouri Compromise quieted the issue until its limitations on slavery were repealed by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] of 1854.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Missouri.html Missouri Compromise]</ref>\n\nIn the South, the Missouri crisis reawakened old fears that a strong federal government could be a fatal threat to slavery. The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian coalition]] that united southern planters and northern farmers, mechanics and artisans in opposition to the threat presented by the [[Federalist Party]] had started to dissolve after the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Forbes pp. 6\u20137</ref> It was not until the Missouri crisis that Americans became aware of the political possibilities of a sectional attack on slavery, and it was not until the [[mass politics]] of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s administration that this type of organization around this issue became practical.<ref>Mason p. 8</ref>\n\n===Nullification Crisis===\n[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|260px|President [[Andrew Jackson]] viewed South Carolina's attempts to nullify the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 as being tantamount to treason.

Calhoun]], was a program for rapid economic modernization featuring protective tariffs, [[internal improvements]] at federal expense, and a national bank. The purpose was to develop American industry and international commerce. Since iron, coal, and water power were mainly in the North, this tax plan was doomed to cause rancor in the South where economies were agriculture-based.<ref>[http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/solguide/VUS06/essay06c.html Leah S.

Pease, \"The Economics and Politics of Charleston's Nullification Crisis\", ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (1981), pp. 335\u2013362</ref>\n\nThe nation suffered an economic downturn throughout the 1820s, and South Carolina was particularly affected. The highly protective Tariff of 1828 (called the \"[[Tariff of Abominations]]\" by its detractors), designed to protect American industry by taxing imported manufactured goods, was enacted into law during the last year of the presidency of [[John Quincy Adams]]. Opposed in the South and parts of New England, the expectation of the tariff's opponents was that with the election of [[Andrew Jackson]] the tariff would be significantly reduced.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v2 pp. 136\u2013137. Niven pg. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'' pg 143</ref>\n\nBy 1828 South Carolina state politics increasingly organized around the tariff issue. When the Jackson administration failed to take any actions to address their concerns, the most radical faction in the state began to advocate that the state declare the tariff null and void within South Carolina. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and his vice-president John C. Calhoun, the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification through his 1828 \"[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]\".<ref>Craven pg.65. Niven pg. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'' pg 143</ref>\n\nCongress enacted a new [[Tariff of 1832|tariff in 1832]], but it offered the state little relief, resulting in the most dangerous sectional crisis since the Union was formed. Some militant South Carolinians even hinted at withdrawing from the Union in response. The newly elected South Carolina legislature then quickly called for the election of delegates to a state convention. Once assembled, the convention voted to declare null and void the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 within the state. President Andrew Jackson responded firmly, declaring nullification an act of [[treason]]. He then took steps to strengthen federal forts in the state.\n\nViolence seemed a real possibility early in 1833 as Jacksonians in Congress introduced a \"[[Force Bill]]\" authorizing the President to use the federal army and navy in order to enforce acts of Congress. No other state had come forward to support South Carolina, and the state itself was divided on willingness to continue the showdown with the federal government. The crisis ended when Clay and Calhoun worked to devise a compromise tariff. Both sides later claimed victory. Calhoun and his supporters in South Carolina claimed a victory for nullification, insisting that it had forced the revision of the tariff. Jackson's followers, however, saw the episode as a demonstration that no single state could assert its rights by independent action.\n\nCalhoun, in turn, devoted his efforts to building up a sense of Southern solidarity so that when another standoff should come, the whole section might be prepared to act as a bloc in resisting the federal government. As early as 1830, in the midst of the crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves\u2014the foundation of the plantation agricultural system\u2014as the chief southern minority right being threatened:\n\n{{quote|I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick {{sic}} institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.<ref>Ellis, Richard E. ''The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis'' (1987), page 193; Freehling, William W. ''Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816\u20131836''. (1965), page 257</ref><ref>Ellis p. 193.  Ellis further notes that \"Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states' rights.  At various points in their careers, [[John Taylor of Caroline|John Taylor]], [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], and [[Nathaniel Macon]] had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners' wishes.\"</ref>}}\n\nOn May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote of this idea, \"the tariff was only the pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] question.\"<ref>[[Jon Meacham]] (2009), ''[[American Lion (book)|American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House]]'', p. 247; ''Correspondence of Andrew Jackson'', Vol. V, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe issue appeared again after 1842's [[Black Tariff]]. A period of relative free trade followed 1846's [[Walker Tariff]], which had been largely written by Southerners. Northern industrialists (and some in western Virginia) complained it was too low to encourage the growth of industry.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, \"The Tariff Issue on the Eve of the Civil War.\" ''American Historical Review'' (1938) 44#1 pp: 50-55 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1840850 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Gag Rule debates===\n{{Main|Gag rule#Anti-slavery petitions in the United States Congress in 1831\u20131844}}\n\nFrom 1831 to 1836 [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AA-SS) initiated a campaign to petition Congress in favor of ending slavery in the [[District of Columbia]] and all federal territories. Hundreds of thousands of petitions were sent, with the number reaching a peak in 1835.<ref>Varon (2008) p. 109. Wilentz (2005) p. 451</ref>\n\nThe [[United States House of Representatives|House]] passed the Pinckney Resolutions on May 26, 1836. The first of these stated that Congress had no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states and the second that it \"ought not\" do so in the District of Columbia. The third resolution, known from the beginning as the \"gag rule\", provided that:\n\n{{quote|All petitions, memorials, resolutions, propositions, or papers, relating in any way, or to any extent whatsoever, to the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid on the table and that no further action whatever shall be had thereon.<ref>Miller (1995) pp. 144\u2013146</ref>}}\n\nThe first two resolutions passed by votes of 182 to 9 and 132 to 45. The gag rule, supported by Northern and Southern Democrats as well as some Southern Whigs, was passed with a vote of 117 to 68.<ref>Miller (1995) pp. 209\u2013210</ref>\n\nFormer President [[John Quincy Adams]], who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1830, became an early and central figure in the opposition to the gag rules.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 470\u2013472</ref> He argued that they were a direct violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". A majority of Northern [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] joined the opposition. Rather than suppress anti-slavery petitions, however, the gag rules only served to offend Americans from Northern states, and dramatically increase the number of petitions.<ref>Miller, 112</ref>\n\nSince the original gag was a resolution, not a standing House Rule, it had to be renewed every session, and the Adams' faction often gained the floor before the gag could be imposed. However in January 1840, the House of Representatives passed the Twenty-first Rule, which prohibited even the reception of anti-slavery petitions and was a standing House rule. Now the pro-petition forces focused on trying to revoke a standing rule. The Rule raised serious doubts about its constitutionality and had less support than the original Pinckney gag, passing only by 114 to 108. Throughout the gag period, Adams' \"superior talent in using and abusing parliamentary rules\" and skill in baiting his enemies into making mistakes, enabled him to evade the rule and debate the slavery issues. The gag rule was finally rescinded on December 3, 1844, by a strongly sectional vote of 108 to 80, all the Northern and four Southern Whigs voting for repeal, along with 55 of the 71 Northern Democrats.<ref>Miller, pp. 476, 479\u2013481</ref>\n\n===Antebellum South and the Union===\nThere had been a continuing contest between the states and the national government over the power of the latter\u2014and over the loyalty of the citizenry\u2014almost since the founding of the republic. The [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] of 1798, for example, had defied the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], and at the [[Hartford Convention]], [[New England]] voiced its opposition to President [[James Madison]] and the [[War of 1812]], and discussed secession from the Union.\n\n====Southern culture====\n[[File:Cottonfieldpanorama-edited.jpg|thumb|center|580px|Picking [[cotton]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]]]\n{{See also|Slavery in the United States}}\n\nAlthough a minority of free Southerners owned slaves, free Southerners of all classes nevertheless defended the institution of slavery<ref>Huston p. 41. Huston writes, \"... on at least three matters southerners were united. First, slaves were property. Second, the sanctity of Southerners' property rights in slaves was beyond the questioning of anyone inside or outside of the South. Third, slavery was the only means of adjusting social relations properly between Europeans and Africans.\"</ref>\u2014threatened by the rise of free labor abolitionist movements in the Northern states\u2014as the cornerstone of their social order.\n\nPer the 1860 census, the percentage of slaveholding families was as follows:<ref>Bonekemper III, Edward H. (2015) ''The Myth of the Lost Cause: Why the South fought the Civil War and Why the North Won''. Regnery Publishing pg 39</ref>\n\n*26% in the 15 Slave states (AL, AR, DE, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, MO, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA)\n*16% in the 4 Border states (DE, KY, MD, MO)\n*31% in the 11 Confederate states (AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA)\n*37% in the first 7 Confederate states (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, SC, TX)\n*25% in the second 4 Confederate states (AR, NC, TN, VA)\n\nMississippi was the highest at 49%, followed by South Carolina at 46%\n\nBased on a system of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] slavery, the social structure of the South was far more stratified and patriarchal than that of the North. In 1850 there were around 350,000 slaveholders in a total free Southern population of about six million. Among slaveholders, the concentration of slave ownership was unevenly distributed. Perhaps around 7 percent of slaveholders owned roughly three-quarters of the slave population. The largest slaveholders, generally owners of large plantations, represented the top stratum of Southern society. They benefited from [[economies of scale]] and needed large numbers of slaves on big plantations to produce cotton, a highly profitable labor-intensive crop.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nPer the 1860 Census, in the 15 slave states, slaveholders owning 30 or more slaves (6.5% of all slaveholders) owned approximately 1,540,000 slaves (39% of all slaves).<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860b-08.pdf</ref>(PDF Pg 64/1860 Census pg 247)\n\nIn the 1850s, as large plantation owners outcompeted smaller farmers, more slaves were owned by fewer planters. Yet poor whites and small farmers generally accepted the political leadership of the planter elite. Several factors helped explain why slavery was not under serious threat of internal collapse from any move for democratic change initiated from the South. First, given the opening of new territories in the West for white settlement, many non-slaveowners also perceived a possibility that they, too, might own slaves at some point in their life.<ref name=\"Brinkley, 1986\">{{cite book |last=Brinkley |first=Alan |title=American History: A Survey |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1986 |page=328}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Violent repression of slaves was a common theme in abolitionist literature in the North. Above, this famous 1863 photo of a slave, [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], deeply scarred from whipping by an overseer, was distributed by abolitionists to illustrate what they saw as the barbarism of Southern society.]]\n\nSecond, small free farmers in the South often embraced [[Racism in the United States|racism]], making them unlikely agents for internal democratic reforms in the South.<ref name=\"Moore, 1966\">{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Barrington |title=Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialoriginsofd00barr |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1966 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialoriginsofd00barr/page/117 117]}}</ref> The principle of [[white supremacy]], accepted by almost all white southerners of all classes, made slavery seem legitimate, natural, and essential for a civilized society. White racism in the South was sustained by official systems of repression such as the \"slave codes\" and elaborate codes of speech, behavior, and social practices illustrating the subordination of blacks to whites. For example, the \"[[slave patrol]]s\" were among the institutions bringing together southern whites of all classes in support of the prevailing economic and racial order. Serving as slave \"patrollers\" and \"overseers\" offered white southerners positions of power and honor. Slave \"patrollers\" and \"overseers\" also won prestige in their communities. Policing and punishing blacks who transgressed the regimentation of slave society was a valued community service in the South, where the fear of free blacks threatening law and order figured heavily in the public discourse of the period.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThird, many [[yeoman|yeomen]] and small farmers with a few slaves were linked to elite planters through the market economy.<ref name=\"North, 1961\">{{cite book |last=North |first=Douglas C. |title=The Economic Growth of the United States 1790\u20131860 |publisher=Englewood Cliffs |year=1961 |page=130}}</ref> In many areas, small farmers depended on local planter elites for vital goods and services, including access to [[cotton gin]]s, markets, feed and livestock, and even loans (since the banking system was not well developed in the antebellum South). Southern tradesmen often depended on the richest planters for steady work. Such dependency effectively deterred many white non-slaveholders from engaging in any political activity that was not in the interest of the large slaveholders. Furthermore, whites of varying social class, including poor whites and \"plain folk\" who worked outside or in the periphery of the market economy (and therefore lacked any real economic interest in the defense of slavery) might nonetheless be linked to elite planters through extensive kinship networks. Since [[inheritance]] in the South was often unequitable (and generally favored eldest sons), it was not uncommon for a poor white person to be perhaps the first cousin of the richest plantation owner of his county and to share the same militant support of slavery as his richer relatives. Finally, there was no [[secret ballot]] at the time anywhere in the United States \u2013 this innovation did not become widespread in the U.S. until the 1880s. For a typical white Southerner, this meant that so much as casting a ballot against the wishes of the establishment meant running the risk of being socially [[:ostracized]].{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThus, by the 1850s, Southern slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike felt increasingly encircled psychologically and politically in the national political arena because of the rise of [[free soil]]ism and [[abolitionism]] in the Northern states. Increasingly dependent on the North for manufactured goods, for commercial services, and for loans, and increasingly cut off from the flourishing agricultural regions of the Northwest, they faced the prospects of a growing free labor and abolitionist movement in the North.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nHistorian [[William C. Davis (historian)|William C. Davis]] refutes the argument that Southern culture was different from that of Northern states or that it was a cause of the war, stating, \"Socially and culturally the North and South were not much different. They prayed to the same deity, spoke the same language, shared the same ancestry, sang the same songs. National triumphs and catastrophes were shared by both.\" He stated that culture was not the cause of the war, but rather, slavery was: \"For all the myths they would create to the contrary, the only significant and defining difference between them was slavery, where it existed and where it did not, for by 1804 it had virtually ceased to exist north of Maryland.

Southerners waged a vitriolic response to political change in the North. Slaveholding interests sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse \"hostile\" and \"ruinous\" legislation. Behind this shift was the growth of the cotton textile industry in the North and in Europe, which left slavery more important than ever to the Southern economy.<ref>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Eugene D. Genovese, ''Slavery in White and Black: Class and Race in the Southern Slaveholders' New World Order'' (2008)</ref>\n\n====Abolitionism====\nSouthern spokesmen greatly exaggerated the power of abolitionists, looking especially at the great popularity of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), the novel and play by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] (whom Abraham Lincoln reputedly called \"the little woman that started this great war\"). They saw a vast growing abolitionist movement after the success of ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' in 1831 by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. The fear was a [[race war]] by blacks that would massacre whites, especially in counties where whites were a small minority.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley Harrold|title=The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKQeBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|year=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=45, 149\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe South reacted with an elaborate intellectual defense of slavery. [[J. D. B. De Bow]] of New Orleans established ''[[De Bow's Review]]'' in 1846, which quickly grew to become the leading Southern magazine, warning about the dangers of depending on the North economically. ''De Bow's Review'' also emerged as the leading voice for secession. The magazine emphasized the South's economic inequality, relating it to the concentration of manufacturing, shipping, banking and international trade in the North. Searching for Biblical passages endorsing slavery and forming economic, sociological, historical and scientific arguments, slavery went from being a \"necessary evil\" to a \"positive good\". Dr. [[John H. Van Evrie]]'s book ''Negroes and Negro slavery: The First an Inferior Race: The Latter Its Normal Condition''\u2014setting out the arguments the title would suggest\u2014was an attempt to apply scientific support to the Southern arguments in favor of race-based slavery.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fleshing Out America: Race, Gender, and the Politics of the Body in American Literature, 1833\u20131879|page=19|first=Carolyn|last=Sorisio|date=2002|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|location=Athens|isbn=0820326372|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8t1wHF4Z24C|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nLatent sectional divisions suddenly activated derogatory sectional imagery which emerged into sectional ideologies. As industrial capitalism gained momentum in the North, Southern writers emphasized whatever aristocratic traits they valued (but often did not practice) in their own society: courtesy, grace, [[chivalry]], the slow pace of life, orderly life and leisure. This supported their argument that slavery provided a more humane society than industrial labor.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peter P. Hinks|author2=John R.

He advocated enslaving Northern factory workers, for their own benefit. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, denounced such Southern insinuations that Northern wage earners were fatally fixed in that condition for life. To Free Soilers, the stereotype of the South was one of a diametrically opposite, static society in which the slave system maintained an entrenched anti-democratic aristocracy.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n====Southern fears of modernization====\nAccording to the historian [[James M. McPherson]], exceptionalism applied not to the South but to the North after the North ended slavery and launched an industrial revolution that led to urbanization, which in turn led to increased education, which in its own turn gave ever-increasing strength to various reform movements but especially abolitionism. The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North (and the fact that most immigrants viewed slavery with disfavor), compounded by the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior. The ''[[Charleston Mercury]]'' read that on the issue of slavery the North and South \"are not only two Peoples, but they are rival, hostile Peoples.\"<ref name=\"McPhersonExceptionalism\">[[James M. McPherson]], \"Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question\", ''Civil War History'' 29 (September 1983)</ref> As ''De Bow's Review'' said, \"We are resisting revolution. ... We are not engaged in a Quixotic fight for the rights of man. ... We are conservative.\"<ref name=\"McPhersonExceptionalism\" />\n\n====Southern fears of modernity====\n[[Allan Nevins]] argued that the Civil War was an \"irrepressible\" conflict, adopting a phrase from Senator [[William H. Seward]]. Nevins synthesized contending accounts emphasizing moral, cultural, social, ideological, political, and economic issues. In doing so, he brought the historical discussion back to an emphasis on social and cultural factors. Nevins pointed out that the North and the South were rapidly becoming two different peoples, a point made also by historian [[Avery Craven]]. At the root of these cultural differences was the problem of slavery, but fundamental assumptions, tastes, and cultural aims of the regions were diverging in other ways as well. More specifically, the North was rapidly modernizing in a manner threatening to the South. Historian McPherson explains:<ref name=\"McPhersonExceptionalism\" />\n\n<blockquote> When secessionists protested in 1861 that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values, they were correct. They fought to preserve their constitutional liberties against the perceived Northern threat to overthrow them. The South's concept of republicanism had not changed in three-quarters of a century; the North's had. ... The ascension to power of the Republican Party, with its ideology of competitive, egalitarian free-labor capitalism, was a signal to the South that the Northern majority had turned irrevocably towards this frightening, revolutionary future.</blockquote>\n\nHarry L. Watson has synthesized research on antebellum southern social, economic, and political history. Self-sufficient [[Yeoman|yeomen]], in Watson's view, \"collaborated in their own transformation\" by allowing promoters of a market economy to gain political influence. Resultant \"doubts and frustrations\" provided fertile soil for the argument that southern rights and liberties were menaced by Black Republicanism.<ref>\"Conflict and Collaboration: Yeomen, Slaveholders, and Politics in the Antebellum South\", ''Social History'' 10 (October 1985): 273\u201398. quote at p. 297.</ref>\n\nJ. Mills Thornton III explained the viewpoint of the average white Alabamian. Thornton contends that Alabama was engulfed in a severe crisis long before 1860. Deeply held principles of freedom, equality, and autonomy, as expressed in [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican values]], appeared threatened, especially during the 1850s, by the relentless expansion of market relations and commercial agriculture. Alabamians were thus, he judged, prepared to believe the worst once Lincoln was elected.<ref>Thornton, ''Politics and Power in a Slave Society: Alabama, 1800\u20131860'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1978)</ref>\n\n===Sectional tensions and the emergence of mass politics===\n{{quote box\n|align = left\n|width = 25%\n|quote = The cry of Free Man was raised, not for the extension of liberty to the black man, but for the protection of the liberty of the white.\n|source = \u2014[[Frederick Douglass]]\n}}\n\nThe politicians of the 1850s were acting in a society in which the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional conflict in the 1820s and 1850s\u2014the most important of which being the stability of the two-party system\u2014were being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and a time in which politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics was, in one of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nHistorian Allan Nevins, for instance, writes of political rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women. Voter turnouts even ran as high as 84% by 1860. An abundance of new parties emerged 1854\u201356, including the Republicans, People's party men, Anti-Nebraskans, Fusionists, [[Know Nothing]]s, Know-Somethings (anti-slavery nativists), Maine Lawites, Temperance men, Rum Democrats, Silver Gray Whigs, Hindus, Hard Shell Democrats, Soft Shells, Half Shells and Adopted Citizens. By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided four ways. Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the Constitutional Union party in 1860.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nMany Southern states held constitutional conventions in 1851 to consider the questions of nullification and secession. With the exception of South Carolina, whose convention election did not even offer the option of \"no secession\" but rather \"no secession without the collaboration of other states\", the Southern conventions were dominated by Unionists who voted down articles of secession.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n===Economics===\nHistorians today generally agree that economic conflicts were not a major cause of the war. While an economic basis to the sectional crisis was popular among the \"Progressive school\" of historians from the 1910s to the 1940s, few professional historians now subscribe to this explanation.<ref>McPherson (2007) pp.4\u20137. James M. McPherson wrote in referring to the Progressive historians, the Vanderbilt agrarians, and revisionists writing in the 1940s, \"While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few historians now subscribe to them.\"</ref> According to economic historian Lee A. Craig, \"In fact, numerous studies by economic historians over the past several decades reveal that economic conflict was not an inherent condition of North-South relations during the antebellum era and did not cause the Civil War.\"<ref>Craig in Woodworth, ed. ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996), p.505.</ref>\n\nWhen numerous groups tried at the last minute in 1860\u201361 to find a compromise to avert war, they did not turn to economic policies. The three major attempts at compromise, the [[Crittenden Compromise]], the [[Corwin Amendment]] and the Washington Peace Conference, addressed only the slavery-related issues of fugitive slave laws, personal liberty laws, slavery in the territories and interference with slavery within the existing slave states.<ref>Donald 2001 pp 134\u201338</ref>\n\n====Economic value of slavery to the South====\nHistorian James L. Huston emphasizes the role of slavery as an economic institution. In October 1860 [[William Lowndes Yancey]], a leading advocate of secession, placed the value of Southern-held slaves at $2.8 billion.<ref>Huston pp. 24\u201325. Huston lists other estimates of the value of slaves; James D. B. De Bow puts it at $2 billion in 1850, while in 1858 Governor James Pettus of Mississippi estimated the value at $2.6 billion in 1858.</ref> Huston writes:\n\n{{quote|Understanding the relations between wealth, slavery, and property rights in the South provides a powerful means of understanding southern political behavior leading to disunion. First, the size dimensions of slavery are important to comprehend, for slavery was a colossal institution. Second, the property rights argument was the ultimate defense of slavery, and white southerners and the proslavery radicals knew it. Third, the weak point in the protection of slavery by property rights was the federal government. ... Fourth, the intense need to preserve the sanctity of property rights in Africans led southern political leaders to demand the nationalization of slavery\u2013 the condition under which slaveholders would always be protected in their property holdings.<ref>Huston, \"''Calculating the Value of the Union''\", p. 25</ref>}}\n\nThe [[cotton gin]] greatly increased the efficiency with which cotton could be harvested, contributing to the consolidation of \"[[King Cotton]]\" as the backbone of the economy of the Deep South, and to the entrenchment of the system of slave labor on which the cotton plantation economy depended.  Any chance that the South would industrialize was over.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThe tendency of [[monoculture]] cotton plantings to lead to soil exhaustion created a need for cotton planters to move their operations to new lands, and therefore to the westward expansion of slavery from the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] into new areas (e.g., Alabama, Mississippi, and beyond to [[East Texas]]).<ref>[http://www.sc.edu/uscpress/2007/3681.html Soil Exhaustion as a Factor in the Agricultural History of Virginia and Maryland, 1606\u20131860<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/Co-Da/Cotton.html Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy \u2013 A-D<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Regional economic differences====\n[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|right|thumb|400px|An animation showing the free/slave status of U.S. states and territories, 1789\u20131861]]\n\nThe South, Midwest, and Northeast had quite different economic structures. They traded with each other and each became more prosperous by staying in the Union, a point many businessmen made in 1860\u201361. However, [[Charles A. Beard]] in the 1920s made a highly influential argument to the effect that these differences caused the war (rather than slavery or constitutional debates). He saw the industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the agrarian Midwest against the plantation South. Critics challenged his image of a unified Northeast and said that the region was in fact highly diverse with many different competing economic interests. In 1860\u201361, most business interests in the Northeast opposed war.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAfter 1950, only a few mainstream historians accepted the Beard interpretation, though it was accepted by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists.<ref>Woodworth, ed.

''Civil War History'' 47, no. 1. (2001): 30\u201356.</ref> Historian [[Kenneth Stampp]], who abandoned Beardianism after 1950, sums up the scholarly consensus:<ref>Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War'' (1981) p 198</ref> \"Most historians ... now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united.\"<ref>Also from Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Imperiled Union'', p 198:<blockquote>Most historians ... now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united. Beard oversimplified the controversies relating to federal economic policy, for neither section unanimously supported or opposed measures such as the protective tariff, appropriations for internal improvements, or the creation of a national banking system. ... During the 1850s, Federal economic policy gave no substantial cause for southern disaffection, for policy was largely determined by pro-Southern Congresses and administrations. Finally, the characteristic posture of the conservative northeastern business community was far from anti-Southern. Most merchants, bankers, and manufacturers were outspoken in their hostility to antislavery agitation and eager for sectional compromise in order to maintain their profitable business connections with the South. The conclusion seems inescapable that if economic differences, real though they were, had been all that troubled relations between North and South, there would be no substantial basis for the idea of an irrepressible conflict.</blockquote></ref>\n\n====Free labor vs. pro-slavery arguments====\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] argued that a free-labor ideology dominated thinking in the North, which emphasized economic opportunity. By contrast, Southerners described free labor as \"greasy mechanics, filthy operators, small-fisted farmers, and moonstruck theorists\".<ref>[[James M.

Without centralized church authorities, American Protestantism was heavily reliant on the Bible, which was read in the standard 19th-century Reformed [[hermeneutic]] of \"common sense\", literal interpretation as if the Bible were speaking directly about the modern American situation instead of events that occurred in a much different context, millennia ago.<ref name=\"Noll, 2002\" /> By the mid-19th century this form of religion and Bible interpretation had become a dominant strand in American religious, moral and political discourse, almost serving as a de facto state religion.<ref name=\"Noll, 2002\" />\n\nThe Bible, interpreted under these assumptions, seemed to clearly suggest that slavery was Biblically justified:<ref name=\"Noll, 2002\" />\n\n<blockquote>\"The pro-slavery South could point to slaveholding by the godly patriarch [[Abraham]] (Gen 12:5; 14:14; 24:35\u201336; 26:13\u201314), a practice that was later incorporated into Israelite national law (Lev 25:44\u201346). It was never denounced by [[Jesus]], who made slavery a model of discipleship (Mk 10:44). The [[Apostle Paul]] supported slavery, counseling obedience to earthly masters (Eph 6:5\u20139; Col 3:22\u201325) as a duty in agreement with \"the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness\" (1 Tim 6:3). Because slaves were to remain in their present state unless they could win their freedom (1 Cor 7:20\u201324), he sent the fugitive slave [[Onesimus]] back to his owner [[Saint Philemon|Philemon]] (Phlm 10\u201320). The abolitionist north had a difficult time matching the pro-slavery south passage for passage. ... Professor Eugene Genovese, who has studied these biblical debates over slavery in minute detail, concludes that the pro-slavery faction clearly emerged victorious over the abolitionists except for one specious argument based on the so-called [[Curse of Ham]] (Gen 9:18\u201327). For our purposes, it is important to realize that the South won this crucial contest with the North by using the prevailing hermeneutic, or method of interpretation, on which both sides agreed. So decisive was its triumph that the South mounted a vigorous counterattack on the abolitionists as infidels who had abandoned the plain words of Scripture for the secular ideology of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\"<ref name=\"Hull, 2003\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/043/Learning%20the%20Lessons%20of%20Slavery%20By%20William%20E.%20Hull_043_05_.htm |last=Hull |first=William E. |title=Learning the Lessons of Slavery |date=February 2003 |journal=Christian Ethics Today |volume=9 |issue=43 |accessdate=2007-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211214614/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/043/Learning%20the%20Lessons%20of%20Slavery%20By%20William%20E.%20Hull_043_05_.htm |archive-date=2007-12-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nProtestant churches in the U.S., unable to agree on what God's Word said about slavery, ended up with schisms between Northern and Southern branches: the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1844, the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] in 1845,<ref>Walter B.

The North\u2014forced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to create\u2014lost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self-consciousness to determine what the Bible said about slavery.

Many of the reformers of the period, including abolitionists, attempted in one way or another to transform the lifestyle and work habits of labor, helping workers respond to the new demands of an [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]], capitalistic society.\n\nAntislavery, like many other reform movements of the period, was influenced by the legacy of the [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival in the new country stressing the reform of individuals, which was still relatively fresh in the American memory. Thus, while the reform spirit of the period was expressed by a variety of movements with often-conflicting political goals, most reform movements shared a common feature in their emphasis on the Great Awakening principle of transforming the human personality through discipline, order, and restraint.\n\n\"Abolitionist\" had several meanings at the time. The followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], including [[Wendell Phillips]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], demanded the \"immediate abolition of slavery\", hence the name. A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, like [[Theodore Weld]] and [[Arthur Tappan]], wanted immediate action, but that action might well be a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage. \"Antislavery men\", like [[John Quincy Adams]], did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841 Adams represented the [[United States v. The Amistad|Amistad]] African slaves in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and argued that they should be set free.<ref name=\"AmistadCase\">{{cite web|title=The Amistad Case |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |url=http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106090007/http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm |archivedate=November 6, 2007 }}</ref> In the last years before the war, \"antislavery\" could mean the Northern majority, like [[Abraham Lincoln]], who opposed ''expansion'' of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, or the [[Fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Act]]. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians. [[James M. McPherson]] explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: \"All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution.\"<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' p. 8; James Brewer Stewart, ''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' (1976); Pressly, 270ff</ref>\n\n[[File:Slavepatrols.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A woodcut from the abolitionist ''Anti-Slavery Almanac'' (1839) depicts the capture of a fugitive slave by a [[slave patrol]].]]\n\nStressing the [[Yankee]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ideals of self-improvement, industry, and thrift, most abolitionists\u2014most notably William Lloyd Garrison\u2014condemned slavery as a lack of control over one's own destiny and the fruits of one's labor.\n\n[[Wendell Phillips]], one of the most ardent abolitionists, attacked the [[Slave Power]] and presaged disunion as early as 1845:\n\n<blockquote> The experience of the fifty years ... shows us the slaves trebling in numbers\u2014slaveholders monopolizing the offices and dictating the policy of the Government\u2014prostituting the strength and influence of the Nation to the support of slavery here and elsewhere\u2014trampling on the rights of the free States, and making the courts of the country their tools. To continue this disastrous alliance longer is madness. ... Why prolong the experiment?<ref>Wendell Phillips, \"No Union With Slaveholders\", January 15, 1845, in Louis Ruchames, ed. ''The Abolitionists'' (1963), p.196.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbolitionists also attacked slavery as a threat to the freedom of white Americans. Defining freedom as more than a simple lack of restraint, antebellum reformers held that the truly free man was one who imposed restraints upon himself. Thus, for the anti-slavery reformers of the 1830s and 1840s, the promise of free labor and upward social mobility (opportunities for advancement, rights to own property, and to control one's own labor), was central to the ideal of reforming individuals.\n\nControversy over the so-called [[Ostend Manifesto]] (which proposed the U.S. annexation of [[Cuba]] as a slave state) and the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]] kept sectional tensions alive before the issue of slavery in the West could occupy the country's politics in the mid-to-late 1850s.\n\nAntislavery sentiment among some groups in the North intensified after the [[Compromise of 1850]], when Southerners began appearing in Northern states to pursue fugitives or often to claim as slaves free African Americans who had resided there for years. Meanwhile, some abolitionists openly sought to prevent enforcement of the law. Violation of the Fugitive Slave Act was often open and organized. In [[Boston]]\u2014a city from which it was boasted that no fugitive had ever been returned\u2014[[Theodore Parker]] and other members of the city's elite helped form mobs to prevent enforcement of the law as early as April 1851. A pattern of public resistance emerged in city after city, notably in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in 1851 (culminating in the [[Jerry Rescue]] incident late that year), and Boston again in 1854. But the issue did not lead to a crisis until revived by the same issue underlying the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820]]: slavery in the territories.\n\n===Arguments for and against slavery===\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, a prominent abolitionist, was motivated by a belief in the growth of democracy. Because the Constitution had a [[three-fifths clause]], a [[fugitive slave clause]], and a [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|20-year protection of the Atlantic slave trade]], Garrison publicly burned a copy of the [[U.S. Constitution]], and called it \"a covenant with death and an agreement with hell\".<ref>Mason I Lowance, ''Against Slavery: An Abolitionist Reader'', (2000), page 26</ref>\nIn 1854, he said:\n\n{{quote|I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, \"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Hence, I am an abolitionist.

In 1848 Radical New York Democrats known as [[Barnburners]], members of the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], and anti-slavery Whigs formed the Free-Soil Party. The party supported former President [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Charles Francis Adams Sr.]] for President and Vice President. The party opposed the expansion of slavery into territories where it had not yet existed, such as [[Oregon]] and the ceded Mexican territory. It had the effect of dividing the Democratic Party in the North, especially in areas of Yankee settlement<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref>\n\n[[Eric Foner]] in ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970) emphasized the importance of free labor ideology to Northern opponents of slavery, pointing out that the moral concerns of the abolitionists were not necessarily the dominant sentiments in the North. Many Northerners (including Lincoln) opposed slavery also because they feared that rich slave owners would buy up the best lands and block opportunity for free white farmers using family and hired labor. Free Soilers joined the Republican party in 1854, with their appeal to powerful demands in the North through a broader commitment to \"[[free labor]]\" principles. Fear of the \"[[Slave Power]]\" had a far greater appeal to Northern self-interest than did abolitionist arguments based on the plight of black slaves in the South.<ref name=\"Leonard L. Richards 2000\"/>\n\n==Slavery question in territories acquired from Mexico==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}} \nSoon after the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] started and long before negotiation of the new [[US-Mexico border]], the question of slavery in the territories to be acquired polarized the Northern and [[Southern United States]] in the most bitter sectional conflict up to this time, which lasted for a deadlock of four years during which the [[Second Party System]] broke up, [[Mormon pioneers]] settled [[Utah]], the [[California Gold Rush]] settled [[California]], and New Mexico under a federal military government turned back [[Texas]]'s attempt to assert control over territory Texas claimed as far west as the [[Rio Grande]]. Eventually the [[Compromise of 1850]] preserved the Union, but only for another decade. Proposals included:\n* The [[Wilmot Proviso]] banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas, which had been annexed the previous year. Passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Later an effort to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] also failed.\n* Failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then [[Stephen Douglas]] extending the [[Missouri Compromise]] line ([[36\u00b030' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific Ocean , allowing slavery in most of present-day [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], southern [[Nevada]], and [[Southern California]], as well as any other territories that might be acquired from Mexico. The line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.\n* [[Popular sovereignty]], developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Douglas as the eventual [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] position, letting each territory decide whether to allow slavery.\n* [[William L. Yancey]]'s \"Alabama Platform\", endorsed by the [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in [[Florida]] and [[Virginia]], called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories either by the federal government or by territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws.\n* General [[Zachary Taylor]], who became the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate in 1848 and then President from March 1849 to July 1850, proposed after becoming President that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico, but much larger than the eventual ones. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], avoiding the question of slavery in the territories.\n* The Mormons' proposal for a [[State of Deseret]], incorporating most of the area of the Mexican Cession but excluding the large non-Mormon populations in [[Northern California]] and central [[New Mexico]], was considered unlikely to succeed in [[United States Congress|Congress]], but nevertheless in 1849 President Zachary Taylor sent his agent [[John Thomas Wilson|John Wilson]] westward with a proposal to combine California and Deseret as a single state, decreasing the number of new [[Slave and free states|free states]] and the erosion of Southern parity in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|thumb|right|500px]]\n* The [[Compromise of 1850]], proposed by [[Henry Clay]] in January 1850, guided to passage by Douglas over Northern Whig and Southern Democrat opposition, and enacted September 1850, admitted California as a free state, including [[Southern California]], and organized [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] with slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty. Texas dropped its claim to the disputed northwestern areas in return for debt relief, and the areas were divided between the two new territories and [[unorganized territory]]. [[El Paso]], where Texas had successfully established county government, was left in Texas. No territory dominated by Southerners (like the later short-lived [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]]) was created. Also, the [[slave trade]] was abolished in [[Washington, D.C.]] (but not slavery itself), and the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was strengthened.\n\n==States' rights==\n{{Main|States' rights}}\n\nStates' rights was an issue in the 19th century for those who felt that the federal government was superseded by the authority of the individual states and was in violation of the role intended for it by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].

Stampp]] notes that each section used states' rights arguments when convenient, and shifted positions when convenient.<ref>Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', page 59</ref> For example, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was enacted by southern representatives to use federal authority to suppress northern states' rights. The constitution gave federal protection to slave property rights, and slaveholders demanded that this federal power should be strengthened and take precedence over northern state laws. Anti-slavery forces in northern legislatures had resisted this constitutional right in the form of state personal liberty laws that placed state laws above the federal mandate.\n\n===States' rights and slavery===\n[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] noted that the states' rights \"never had any real vitality independent of underlying conditions of vast social, economic, or political significance.\"<ref>Schlesinger quotes from an essay \"The State Rights Fetish\" excerpted in Stampp p. 70</ref> He further elaborated:\n\n{{quote|From the close of the nullification episode of 1832\u20131833 to the outbreak of the Civil War, the agitation of state rights was intimately connected with a new issue of growing importance, the slavery question, and the principal form assumed by the doctrine was that of the right of secession. The pro-slavery forces sought refuge in the state rights position as a shield against federal interference with pro-slavery projects. ... As a natural consequence, anti-slavery legislatures in the North were led to lay great stress on the national character of the Union and the broad powers of the general government in dealing with slavery. Nevertheless, it is significant to note that when it served anti-slavery purposes better to lapse into state rights dialectic, northern legislatures did not hesitate to be inconsistent.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTyuTDhmsIwC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false Schlesinger in Stampp pp. 68\u201369]</ref>}}\n\nEchoing Schlesinger, [[Forrest McDonald]] wrote that \"the dynamics of the tension between federal and state authority changed abruptly during the late 1840s\" as a result of the acquisition of territory in the Mexican War. McDonald states:\n\n{{quote|And then, as a by-product or offshoot of a war of conquest, slavery\u2013 a subject that leading politicians had, with the exception of the gag rule controversy and Calhoun's occasional outbursts, scrupulously kept out of partisan debate\u2013 erupted as the dominant issue in that arena. So disruptive was the issue that it subjected the federal Union to the greatest strain the young republic had yet known.<ref>McDonald p. 143</ref>}}\n\nIn a February 1861 speech to the [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|Virginian secession convention]], Georgian [[Henry L. Benning]] stated the reasoning behind Georgia's declaring secession from the Union:\n\n{{quote|What was the reason that induced ... secession? This reason may be summed up in one single proposition. It was a conviction, a deep conviction ... that a separation from the North-was the only thing that could prevent the abolition of ... slavery. ... unless there had been a separation from the North, slavery would be abolished in Georgia ...<ref name=GordonRhea>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html |last=Rhea |first=Gordon |title=Why Non-Slaveholding Southerners Fought |work=Civil War Trust |publisher=Civil War Trust |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321183207/http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html |archivedate=March 21, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=Feb1861Speech>{{cite web|url=http://civilwarcauses.org/benningva.htm |last=Benning |first=Henry L. |title=Speech of Henry Benning to the Virginia Convention |date=February 18, 1861 |work=Proceedings of the Virginia State Convention of 1861 |volume=1 |pages=62\u201375 |accessdate=March 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713102827/http://civilwarcauses.org/benningva.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2015 }}</ref>}}\n\n===States' rights and minority rights===\nStates' rights theories gained strength from the awareness that the Northern population was growing much faster than the population of the South, so it was only a matter of time before the North controlled the federal government. Acting as a \"conscious minority\", Southerners hoped that a strict, constructionist interpretation of the Constitution would limit federal power over the states, and that a defense of states' rights against federal encroachments or even nullification or secession would save the South.<ref>Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', p. 14</ref> Before 1860, most presidents were either Southern or pro-South. The North's growing population would mean the election of pro-North presidents, and the addition of free-soil states would end Southern parity with the North in the Senate. As the historian [[Allan Nevins]] described Calhoun's theory of states' rights, \"Governments, observed Calhoun, were formed to protect minorities, for majorities could take care of themselves.\"<ref>Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny 1847\u20131852'', p. 155</ref>\n\nUntil the 1860 election, the South's interests nationally were entrusted to the Democratic Party. In 1860, the Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions as the result of a \"bitter debate in the Senate between Jefferson Davis and Stephen Douglas\". The debate was over resolutions proposed by Davis \"opposing popular sovereignty and supporting a federal slave code and states' rights\" which carried over to the national convention in Charleston.<ref>Donald, Baker, and Holt, p.117.</ref>\n\nJefferson Davis defined equality in terms of the equal rights of states,<ref>When arguing for the equality of states, he said, \"Who has been in advance of him in the fiery charge on the rights of the States, and in assuming to the Federal Government the power to crush and to coerce them? Even to-day he has repeated his doctrines.

Keitt]] of South Carolina said, \"The [[Republican Party (United States)|anti-slavery party]] contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States.\"<ref>Lawrence Keitt, Congressman from South Carolina, in a speech to the House on January 25, 1860: ''Congressional Globe''.</ref>\n\nStampp mentioned Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]]' ''A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States'' as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \"[[Cornerstone Speech|cornerstone of the Confederacy]]\" when the war began and then later switched course in saying that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after the Confederacy's defeat. Stampp said that Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]].<ref>Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nHistorian [[William C. Davis (historian)|William C. Davis]] also mentioned inconsistencies in Southern states' rights arguments. He explained the [[Confederate States Constitution|Confederate Constitution]]'s protection of slavery at the national level as follows:\n\n{{quote|To the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William C.|last=Davis|title=Look Away!: A History of the Confederate States of America|date=2002|pages=97\u201398}}</ref>}}\n\nW.C. Davis also stated that:\n\n{{quote|In fact, the state rights defense of secession in 1860\u20131861 did not really appear in force until after 1865 as builders of the Lost Cause myth sought to distance themselves from slavery.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William C.|last=Davis|title=The Cause Lost: Myths and Realities of the Confederacy|date=1996|location=Kansas|publisher=University Press of Kansas|page=180}}</ref>}}\n\nSouthern historian Gordon Rhea wrote in 2011 that:\n\n{{quote|Tariffs appear nowhere in ... sermons and speeches, and 'states' rights' are mentioned only in the context of the rights of states to ... own other humans. The central message was to play on the fear of African barbarians ... The preachers and politicians delivered on their promise. The Confederate States were established explicitly to preserve and expand the institution of slavery. [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]], the Confederacy's vice president, [[Cornerstone Speech|said so himself in 1861]], in unambiguous terms.<ref name=GordonRhea />}}\n\n==The Compromise of 1850==\n{{Main|Compromise of 1850}}\nThe victory of the United States over Mexico resulted in the addition of large new territories conquered from Mexico. Controversy over whether these territories would be slave or free raised the risk of a war between slave and free states, and Northern support for the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would have banned slavery in the conquered territories, increased sectional tensions. The controversy was temporarily resolved by the [[Compromise of 1850]], which allowed the territories of [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] to decide for or against slavery, but also allowed the admission of [[California]] as a free state, reduced the size of the slave state of [[Texas]] by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the [[District of Columbia]]. In return, the South got a stronger [[fugitive slave law]] than the version mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. The Fugitive Slave Law would reignite controversy over slavery.\n\n===Fugitive Slave Law issues===\nThe [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] required that Northerners assist Southerners in reclaiming fugitive slaves, which many Northerners found to be extremely offensive. [[Anthony Burns]] was among the fugitive slaves captured and returned in chains to slavery as a result of the law. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s best selling novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' greatly increased opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law.\n\n==Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act (1854)==\n{{Main|Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act}}\nMost people thought the Compromise had ended the territorial issue, but [[Stephen A. Douglas]] reopened it in 1854, in the name of democracy. Douglas proposed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Bill with the intention of opening up vast new high-quality farm lands to settlement. As a [[Chicago]]an, he was especially interested in the railroad connections from Chicago into Kansas and Nebraska, but that was not a controversial point. More importantly, Douglas firmly believed in democracy at the grass roots\u2014that actual settlers have the right to decide on slavery, not politicians from other states. His bill provided that [[popular sovereignty]], through the territorial legislatures, should decide \"all questions pertaining to slavery\", thus effectively repealing the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The ensuing public reaction against it created a firestorm of protest in the Northern states. It was seen as an effort to repeal the Missouri Compromise. However, the popular reaction in the first month after the bill's introduction failed to foreshadow the gravity of the situation. As Northern papers initially ignored the story, Republican leaders lamented the lack of a popular response.\n\nEventually, the popular reaction did come, but the leaders had to spark it. [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s \"Appeal of the Independent Democrats\" did much to arouse popular opinion. In New York, [[William H. Seward]] finally took it upon himself to organize a rally against the Nebraska bill, since none had arisen spontaneously. Press such as the ''National Era'', the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and local free-soil journals, condemned the bill. The [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates of 1858]] drew national attention to the issue of slavery expansion.\n\n===Founding of the Republican Party (1854)===\n{{refimprove|Section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:CSumner.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Charles Sumner, the Senate's leading opponent of slavery]]\n{{See also|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nConvinced that Northern society was superior to that of the South, and increasingly persuaded of the South's ambitions to extend slave power beyond its existing borders, Northerners were embracing a viewpoint that made conflict likely; however, conflict required the ascendancy of a political group to express the views of the North, such as the Republican Party. The Republican Party\u2014campaigning on the popular, emotional issue of \"free soil\" in the frontier\u2014captured the [[White House]] after just six years of existence.\n\nThe Republican Party grew out of the controversy over the Kansas\u2013Nebraska legislation. Once the Northern reaction against the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act took place, its leaders acted to advance another political reorganization. [[Henry Wilson]] declared the Whig Party dead and vowed to oppose any efforts to resurrect it. [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''Tribune'' called for the formation of a new Northern party, and [[Benjamin Wade]], Chase, [[Charles Sumner]], and others spoke out for the union of all opponents of the Nebraska Act. The ''Tribune{{'}}''s [[Gamaliel Bailey]] was involved in calling a caucus of anti-slavery Whig and Democratic Party Congressmen in May.\n\nMeeting in a [[Ripon, Wisconsin]], [[Congregational church]] on February 28, 1854, some thirty opponents of the Nebraska Act called for the organization of a new political party and suggested that \"Republican\" would be the most appropriate name (to link their cause to the defunct [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]] of Thomas Jefferson). These founders also took a leading role in the creation of the Republican Party in many northern states during the summer of 1854. While conservatives and many moderates were content merely to call for the restoration of the Missouri Compromise or a prohibition of slavery extension, radicals advocated repeal of the Fugitive Slave Laws and rapid abolition in existing states. The term \"radical\" has also been applied to those who objected to the Compromise of 1850, which extended slavery in the territories.\n\nBut without the benefit of hindsight, the 1854 elections would seem to indicate the possible triumph of the [[Know-Nothing]] movement rather than anti-slavery, with the Catholic/immigrant question replacing slavery as the issue capable of mobilizing mass appeal. Know-Nothings, for instance, captured the mayoralty of [[Philadelphia]] with a majority of over 8,000 votes in 1854. Even after opening up immense discord with his Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, Senator Douglas began speaking of the Know-Nothings, rather than the Republicans, as the principal danger to the Democratic Party.\n\nWhen Republicans spoke of themselves as a party of \"[[free labor]]\", they appealed to a rapidly growing, primarily middle class base of support, not permanent wage earners or the unemployed (the working class). When they extolled the virtues of free labor, they were merely reflecting the experiences of millions of men who had \"made it\" and millions of others who had a realistic hope of doing so. Like the [[Tory|Tories]] in England, the Republicans in the United States would emerge as the [[Nationalism|nationalists]], homogenizers, [[Imperialism|imperialists]], and cosmopolitans.\n\nThose who had not yet \"made it\" included [[Irish Americans|Irish immigrants]], who made up a large growing proportion of Northern factory workers. Republicans often saw the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] working class as lacking the qualities of self-discipline, temperance, and sobriety essential for their vision of ordered liberty. Republicans insisted that there was a high correlation between education, religion, and hard work\u2014the values of the \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\"\u2014and Republican votes. \"Where free schools are regarded as a nuisance, where religion is least honored and lazy unthrift is the rule,\" read an editorial of the pro-Republican ''Chicago Democratic Press'' after [[James Buchanan]]'s defeat of [[John C. Fremont]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|1856 presidential election]], \"there Buchanan has received his strongest support.\"\n\nEthno-religious, socio-economic, and cultural fault lines ran throughout American society, but were becoming increasingly sectional, pitting Yankee Protestants with a stake in the emerging industrial capitalism and American nationalism increasingly against those tied to Southern slaveholding interests. For example, acclaimed historian [[Don E. Fehrenbacher]], in his ''Prelude to Greatness, Lincoln in the 1850s'', noticed how [[Illinois]] was a microcosm of the national political scene, pointing out voting patterns that bore striking correlations to regional patterns of settlement. Those areas settled from the South were staunchly Democratic, while those by [[New England]]ers were staunchly Republican. A belt of border counties were known for their political moderation, and traditionally held the balance of power. Intertwined with religious, ethnic, regional, and class identities, the issues of free labor and free soil were thus easy to play on.\n\nEvents during the next two years in \"Bleeding Kansas\" sustained the popular fervor originally aroused among some elements in the North by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] settlers from the North were encouraged by press and pulpit and the powerful organs of abolitionist propaganda. Often they received financial help from such organizations as the [[Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company]]. Those from the South often received financial contributions from the communities they left. Southerners sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse \"hostile and ruinous legislation\".\n\nWhile the Great Plains were largely unfit for the cultivation of [[cotton]], informed Southerners demanded that the West be open to slavery, often\u2014perhaps most often\u2014with minerals in mind. [[Brazil]], for instance, was an example of the successful use of slave labor in mining. In the middle of the 18th century, [[diamond]] mining supplemented [[gold]] mining in [[Minas Gerais]] and accounted for a massive transfer of masters and slaves from Brazil's northeastern sugar region. Southern leaders knew a good deal about this experience. It was even promoted in the pro-slavery ''[[De Bow's Review]]'' as far back as 1848.\n\n==Fragmentation of the American party system==\n\n===\"Bleeding Kansas\" and the elections of 1856===\n[[File:Augustus Washington - John Brown - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]]]\n{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1856|Bleeding Kansas}}\n\nIn Kansas around 1855, the slavery issue reached a condition of intolerable tension and violence. But this was in an area where an overwhelming proportion of settlers were merely land-hungry Westerners indifferent to the public issues. The majority of the inhabitants were not concerned with sectional tensions or the issue of slavery. Instead, the tension in Kansas began as a contention between rival claimants. During the first wave of settlement, no one held titles to the land, and settlers rushed to occupy newly open land fit for [[Tillage|cultivation]]. While the tension and violence did emerge as a pattern pitting [[Yankee]] and Missourian settlers against each other, there is little evidence of any ideological divides on the questions of slavery. Instead, the Missouri claimants, thinking of Kansas as their own domain, regarded the Yankee [[squatting|squatters]] as invaders, while the Yankees accused the Missourians of grabbing the best land without honestly settling on it.\n\nHowever, the 1855\u201356 violence in \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" did reach an ideological climax after [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\u2014regarded by followers as the instrument of God's will to destroy slavery\u2014entered the melee. His assassination of five pro-slavery settlers (the so-called \"[[Pottawatomie massacre]]\", during the night of May 24, 1856) resulted in some irregular, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla-style]] strife. Aside from John Brown's fervor, the strife in Kansas often involved only armed bands more interested in land claims or loot.\n\n{{quote box\n|align = left\n|width = 35%\n|quote = His zeal in the cause of freedom was infinitely superior to mine ... Mine was as the taper light; his was as the burning sun. I could live for the slave; John Brown could die for him.\n|source = \u2014[[Frederick Douglass]] speaking of John Brown\n}}\n\nOf greater importance than the civil strife in Kansas, however, was the reaction against it nationwide and in Congress. In both North and South, the belief was widespread that the aggressive designs of the other section were epitomized by (and responsible for) what was happening in Kansas. Consequently, \"Bleeding Kansas\" emerged as a symbol of sectional controversy.\n\nIndignant over the developments in Kansas, the Republicans\u2014the first entirely [[sectionalism|sectional]] major party in U.S. history\u2014entered their first presidential campaign with confidence. Their nominee, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], was a generally safe candidate for the new party.<ref>[[Carl Sandburg]] (1954), ''Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years'', reprint, New York: Dell, Volume 1 of 3, Chapter 10, \"The Deepening Slavery Issue\", p. [221].</ref> Although his nomination upset some of their [[Know Nothing|Nativist Know-Nothing]] supporters (his mother was a Catholic), the nomination of the famed explorer of the Far West and ex-senator from California with a short political record was an attempt to woo ex-Democrats. The other two Republican contenders, [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]], were seen as too radical.\n\nNevertheless, the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|campaign of 1856]] was waged almost exclusively on the slavery issue\u2014pitted as a struggle between democracy and aristocracy\u2014focusing on the question of Kansas. The Republicans condemned the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery, but they advanced a program of [[public works|internal improvements]] combining the idealism of anti-slavery with the economic aspirations of the North. The new party rapidly developed a powerful partisan culture, and energetic activists drove voters to the polls in unprecedented numbers. People reacted with fervor. Young Republicans organized the \"Wide Awake\" clubs and chanted \"Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men, Fr\u00e9mont!\" With Southern [[Fire-Eaters]] and even some moderates uttering threats of secession if Fr\u00e9mont won, the Democratic candidate, [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], benefited from apprehensions about the future of the Union.\n\n[[Millard Fillmore]], the candidate of the American Party (Know-Nothings) and the Silver Gray Whigs, said in a speech at [[Albany, New York]], that the election of a Republican candidate would [[Secession in the United States|dissolve the Union]]. Abraham Lincoln replied on July 23 in a speech at [[Galena, Illinois]]; [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote that this speech probably resembled [[Lincoln's Lost Speech]]: \"This Government would be very weak, indeed, if a majority, with a disciplined army and navy, and a well-filled treasury, could not preserve itself, when attacked by an unarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. All this talk about the dissolution of the Union is humbug\u2014nothing but folly. ''We won't'' dissolve the Union, and ''you shan't''.\"<ref>The speech was reported by newspapers in Galena and Springfield, IL.

Sandford\", ''The American Journal of Legal History'', 32 (4): 373\u2013390.</ref> were both part of the [[Bleeding Kansas]] controversy over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which was [[Stephen Douglas]]' attempt at replacing the [[Missouri Compromise]] ban on slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories with popular sovereignty, which meant that the people of a territory could vote either for or against slavery. The Lecompton Constitution, which would have allowed slavery in Kansas, was the result of massive vote fraud by the pro-slavery [[Border Ruffian]]s. Douglas defeated the Lecompton Constitution because it was supported by the minority of pro-slavery people in Kansas, and Douglas believed in majority rule. Douglas hoped that both South and North would support popular sovereignty, but the opposite was true. Neither side trusted Douglas.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Supreme Court decision of 1857 in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' added to the controversy. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney]]'s decision said that blacks were \"so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,\"<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis'', page 275.</ref> and that slavery could spread into the territories even if the majority of people in the territories were anti-slavery. Lincoln warned that \"the next ''Dred Scott'' decision\"<ref>First Lincoln Douglas Debate at Ottawa, Illinois August 21, 1858</ref> could impose slavery on Northern states.<ref>Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''[[The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics]]'' (178) pp. 445\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Buchanan, Republicans and anti-administration Democrats===\n[[File:Buchanan-thumbnail.jpg|left|frame|President James Buchanan]]\n{{See also|Lecompton constitution|Stephen A. Douglas|James Buchanan}}\nPresident [[James Buchanan]] decided to end the troubles in Kansas by urging Congress to admit Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. Kansas voters, however, soundly rejected this constitution\u2014at least with a measure of widespread fraud on both sides\u2014by more than 10,000 votes. As Buchanan directed his presidential authority to this goal, he further angered the Republicans and alienated members of his own party. Prompting their break with the administration, the Douglasites saw this scheme as an attempt to pervert the principle of popular sovereignty on which the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was based. Nationwide, conservatives were incensed, feeling as though the principles of [[states' rights]] had been violated. Even in the South, ex-Whigs and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] Know-Nothings\u2014most notably [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] and [[John J. Crittenden]] (key figures in the event of sectional controversies)\u2014urged the Republicans to oppose the administration's moves and take up the demand that the territories be given the power to accept or reject sovereignty.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the schism in the Democratic party deepened, moderate Republicans argued that an alliance with anti-administration Democrats, especially Stephen Douglas, would be a key advantage in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 elections]]. Some Republican observers saw the controversy over the Lecompton Constitution as an opportunity to peel off Democratic support in the border states, where Fr\u00e9mont picked up little support. After all, the border states had often gone for Whigs with a Northern base of support in the past without prompting threats of Southern withdrawal from the Union.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAmong the proponents of this strategy was ''[[The New York Times]]'', which called on the Republicans to downplay opposition to popular sovereignty in favor of a compromise policy calling for \"no more slave states\" in order to quell sectional tensions. The ''Times'' maintained that for the Republicans to be competitive in the 1860 elections, they would need to broaden their base of support to include all voters who for one reason or another were upset with the Buchanan Administration.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIndeed, pressure was strong for an alliance that would unite the growing opposition to the Democratic Administration. But such an alliance was no novel idea; it would essentially entail transforming the Republicans into the national, conservative, Union party of the country. In effect, this would be a successor to the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRepublican leaders, however, staunchly opposed any attempts to modify the party position on slavery, appalled by what they considered a surrender of their principles when, for example, all the ninety-two Republican members of Congress voted for the [[Crittenden-Montgomery bill]] in 1858. Although this compromise measure blocked Kansas' entry into the union as a slave state, the fact that it called for popular sovereignty, rather than outright opposition to the expansion of slavery, was troubling to the party leaders.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn the end, the Crittenden-Montgomery bill did not forge a grand anti-administration coalition of Republicans, ex-Whig Southerners in the border states, and Northern Democrats. Instead, the Democratic Party merely split along sectional lines. Anti-Lecompton Democrats complained that a new, pro-slavery test had been imposed upon the party. The Douglasites, however, refused to yield to administration pressure. Like the anti-Nebraska Democrats, who were now members of the Republican Party, the Douglasites insisted that they\u2014not the administration\u2014commanded the support of most northern Democrats.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nExtremist sentiment in the South advanced dramatically as the Southern planter class perceived its hold on the executive, legislative, and judicial apparatus of the central government wane. It also grew increasingly difficult for Southern Democrats to manipulate power in many of the Northern states through their allies in the Democratic Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Honor===\nHistorians have emphasized that the sense of [[honor]] was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners.<ref>Bertram Wyatt-Brown, ''Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South'' (1982) pp 22\u201323, 363</ref> The idea of being treated like a second-class citizen was anathema and could not be tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher J.

Sumner said the Southerners had committed a \"crime against Kansas\", singling out Senator [[Andrew Butler|Andrew P. Butler]] of South Carolina:\n\n<blockquote>Not in any common lust for power did this uncommon tragedy have its origin. It is the rape of a virgin Territory, compelling it to the hateful embrace of slavery; and it may be clearly traced to a depraved desire for a new Slave State, hideous offspring of such a crime, in the hope of adding to the power of slavery in the National Government.<ref>Michael William Pfau, \"Time, Tropes, and Textuality: Reading Republicanism in Charles Sumner's 'Crime Against Kansas'\", ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' vol 6 #3 (2003) 385\u2013413, quote on p. 393 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v006/6.3pfau.html online in Project MUSE]</ref></blockquote>\n\nSumner famously cast the South Carolinian as having \"chosen a mistress ... who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight \u2013 I mean the harlot, slavery!\"<ref>In modern terms Sumner accused Butler of being a \"pimp who attempted to introduce the whore, slavery, into Kansas\" says {{cite book|author1=Judith N.

Brooks was lauded as a hero upholding Southern honor. Although Representative [[Anson Burlingame]] managed to publicly embarrass Brooks in retaliation, the original episode further polarized North and South, strengthened the new Republican Party, and added a new element of violence on the floor of Congress.<ref>William E.

Seward]], Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson]]\n\nDespite their significant loss in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|election of 1856]], Republican leaders realized that even though they appealed only to Northern voters, they need win only two more states, such as [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Illinois]], to win the presidency in 1860.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the Democrats were grappling with their own troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused on the issue of slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it might be necessary to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe controversy over slavery in the West was still not creating a fixation on the issue of slavery. Although the old restraints on the sectional tensions were being eroded with the rapid extension of [[mass politics]] and mass democracy in the North, the perpetuation of conflict over the issue of slavery in the West still required the efforts of radical Democrats in the South and radical Republicans in the North. They had to ensure that the sectional conflict would remain at the center of the political debate.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[William H. Seward|William Seward]] contemplated this potential in the 1840s, when the Democrats were the nation's majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country's institutional structure and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation's territories and to garner a great deal of influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals of American democracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRepublicans believed in the existence of \"the Slave Power Conspiracy\", which had seized control of the federal government and was attempting to pervert the Constitution for its own purposes. The \"Slave Power\" idea gave the Republicans the anti-aristocratic appeal with which men like Seward had long wished to be associated politically. By fusing older anti-slavery arguments with the idea that slavery posed a threat to Northern free labor and democratic values, it enabled the Republicans to tap into the egalitarian outlook which lay at the heart of Northern society.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn this sense, during the 1860 presidential campaign, Republican orators even cast \"Honest Abe\" as an embodiment of these principles, repeatedly referring to him as \"the child of labor\" and \"son of the frontier\", who had proved how \"honest industry and toil\" were rewarded in the North. Although Lincoln had been a Whig, the \"[[Wide Awakes]]\" (members of the Republican clubs) used replicas of rails that he had split to remind voters of his humble origins.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nIn almost every northern state, organizers attempted to have a Republican Party or an anti-Nebraska fusion movement on ballots in 1854. <!-- The groundswell of popular clamor fed by the issue of free soil, however, was powerful enough to thwart these aims. Conservatives were not able to ensure the nomination of a candidate regarded as moderate enough in the South so as to not inspire the secession of Southern states in 1860. parag is about 1854, no? --> In areas where the radical Republicans controlled the new organization, the comprehensive radical program became the party policy. Just as they helped organize the Republican Party in the summer of 1854, the radicals played an important role in the national organization of the party in 1856. Republican conventions in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Illinois]] adopted radical platforms. These radical platforms in such states as [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]] usually called for the divorce of the government from slavery, the repeal of the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]], and no more slave states, as did platforms in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Minnesota]], and Massachusetts when radical influence was high.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nConservatives at the Republican 1860 [[U.S. presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]] in [[Chicago]] were able to block the nomination of [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], who had an earlier reputation as a radical (but by 1860 had been criticized by [[Horace Greeley]] as being too moderate). Other candidates had earlier joined or formed parties opposing the Whigs and had thereby made enemies of many delegates. Lincoln was selected on the third ballot. However, conservatives were unable to bring about the resurrection of \"Whiggery\". The convention's resolutions regarding slavery were roughly the same as they had been in 1856, but the language appeared less radical. In the following months, even Republican conservatives like [[Thomas Ewing]] and [[Edward Dickinson Baker|Edward Baker]] embraced the platform language that \"the normal condition of territories was freedom\". All in all, the organizers had done an effective job of shaping the official policy of the Republican Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSouthern slaveholding interests now faced the prospects of a Republican president and the entry of new free states that would alter the nation's balance of power between the sections. To many Southerners, the resounding defeat of the Lecompton Constitution foreshadowed the entry of more free states into the Union. Dating back to the Missouri Compromise, the Southern region desperately sought to maintain an equal balance of slave states and free states so as to be competitive in the Senate. Since the last slave state was admitted in 1845, five more free states had entered. The tradition of maintaining a balance between North and South was abandoned in favor of the addition of more free soil states.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Sectional battles over federal policy in the late 1850s===\n\n====Lincoln\u2013Douglas Debates====\n{{Main|Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates of 1858}}\nThe Lincoln-Douglas Debates were a series of seven debates in 1858 between [[Stephen Douglas]], United States senator from Illinois, and [[Abraham Lincoln]], the Republican who sought to replace Douglas in the Senate. The debates were mainly about slavery. Douglas defended his [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which replaced the [[Missouri Compromise]] ban on slavery in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north and west of [[Missouri]] with [[popular sovereignty]], which allowed residents of territories such as the [[Territory of Kansas|Kansas]] to vote either for or against slavery. Douglas put Lincoln on the defensive by accusing him of being a Black Republican abolitionist, but Lincoln responded by asking Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the [[Dred Scott decision]]. Douglas' [[Freeport Doctrine]] was that residents of a territory could keep slavery out by refusing to pass a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. Douglas' Freeport Doctrine, and the fact that he helped defeat the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]], made Douglas unpopular in the South, which led to the 1860 split of the Democratic Party into Northern and Southern wings. The Democrats retained control of the Illinois legislature, and Douglas thus retained his seat in the U.S. Senate (at that time senators were elected by the state legislatures, not by popular vote); however, Lincoln's national profile was greatly raised, paving the way for his election as president of the United States two years later.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Background====\nIn ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), [[Charles A. Beard|Charles and Mary Beard]] argue that slavery was not so much a social or cultural institution as an economic one (a labor system). The Beards cited inherent conflicts between Northeastern finance, manufacturing, and commerce and Southern plantations, which competed to control the federal government so as to protect their own interests. According to the economic determinists of the era, both groups used arguments over slavery and states' rights as a cover.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRecent historians have rejected the Beardian thesis. But their economic determinism has influenced subsequent historians in important ways. ''[[Time on the Cross]]: The Economics of American Negro Slavery'' (1974) by [[Robert William Fogel]] (who would win the 1993 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]) and [[Stanley L. Engerman]], wrote that slavery was profitable and that the price of slaves would have continued to rise. Modernization theorists, such as [[Raimondo Luraghi]], have argued that as the [[Industrial Revolution]] was expanding on a worldwide scale, the days of wrath were coming for a series of agrarian, pre-capitalistic, \"backward\" societies throughout the world, from the Italian and American South to India. But most American historians point out the South was highly developed and on average about as prosperous as the North.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Panic of 1857 and sectional realignments====\n[[File:abraham-lincoln.png|200px|thumb|left|\"Vote yourself a farm\u2013 vote yourself a tariff\": a campaign slogan for [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}]]\n\nA few historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe that the serious financial [[Panic of 1857]] and the economic difficulties leading up to it strengthened the Republican Party and heightened sectional tensions. Before the panic, strong economic growth was being achieved under relatively low tariffs. Hence much of the nation concentrated on growth and prosperity.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe iron and textile industries were facing acute, worsening trouble each year after 1850. By 1854, stocks of iron were accumulating in each world market. Iron prices fell, forcing many American iron mills to shut down.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRepublicans urged western farmers and northern manufacturers to blame the depression on the domination of the low-tariff economic policies of southern-controlled Democratic administrations. However, the depression revived suspicion of Northeastern banking interests in both the South and the West. Eastern demand for western farm products shifted the West closer to the North. As the \"transportation revolution\" (canals and railroads) went forward, an increasingly large share and absolute amount of [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], and other staples of western producers\u2014once difficult to haul across the [[Appalachians]]\u2014went to markets in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. The depression emphasized the value of the western markets for eastern goods and homesteaders who would furnish markets and respectable profits.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAside from the land issue, economic difficulties strengthened the Republican case for higher tariffs for industries in response to the depression. This issue was important in Pennsylvania and perhaps New Jersey.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Southern response====\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War. All of the lands east of, or bordering, the Mississippi River were organized as states in the Union, but the West was still largely unsettled.]]\n\nMeanwhile, many Southerners grumbled over \"radical\" notions of giving land away to farmers that would \"abolitionize\" the area. While the ideology of Southern sectionalism was well-developed before the Panic of 1857 by figures like J.D.B. De Bow, the panic helped convince even more cotton barons that they had grown too reliant on Eastern financial interests.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[Thomas Prentice Kettell]], former editor of the ''Democratic Review'', was another commentator popular in the South to enjoy a great degree of prominence between 1857 and 1860. Kettell gathered an array of statistics in his book on ''Southern Wealth and Northern Profits'', to show that the South produced vast wealth, while the North, with its dependence on raw materials, siphoned off the wealth of the South.<ref name=\"Donald, 1961\">{{cite book |last=Donald |first=David |author2=Randal, J.G. |title=The Civil War and Reconstruction |location=Boston |publisher=D.C.

After the political realignments of 1857\u201358\u2014manifested by the emerging strength of the Republican Party and their networks of local support nationwide\u2014almost every issue was entangled with the controversy over the expansion of slavery in the West. While questions of tariffs, banking policy, public land, and subsidies to railroads did not always unite all elements in the North and the Northwest against the interests of slaveholders in the South under the pre-1854 party system, they were translated in terms of sectional conflict\u2014with the expansion of slavery in the West involved.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the depression strengthened the Republican Party, slaveholding interests were becoming convinced that the North had aggressive and hostile designs on the Southern way of life. The South was thus increasingly fertile ground for secessionism.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Republicans' Whig-style personality-driven \"hurrah\" campaign helped stir hysteria in the slave states upon the emergence of Lincoln and intensify divisive tendencies, while Southern \"fire eaters\" gave credence to notions of the slave power conspiracy among Republican constituencies in the North and West. New Southern demands to re-open the [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave trade]] further fueled sectional tensions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFrom the early 1840s until the outbreak of the Civil War, the cost of slaves had been rising steadily. Meanwhile, the price of cotton was experiencing market fluctuations typical of raw commodities. After the Panic of 1857, the price of cotton fell while the price of slaves continued its steep rise. At the 1858 Southern commercial convention, William L. Yancey of [[Alabama]] called for the reopening of the African slave trade. Only the delegates from the states of the Upper South, who profited from the domestic trade, opposed the reopening of the slave trade since they saw it as a potential form of competition. The convention in 1858 wound up voting to recommend the repeal of all laws against slave imports, despite some reservations.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===John Brown and Harpers Ferry (1859)===\n{{Main|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry}}\nOn October 16, 1859, radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] led an attempt to start an armed slave revolt by seizing the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|U.S. Army arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry, Virginia]] (now West Virginia). Brown and twenty followers, both whites (including two of Brown's sons) and blacks (three free blacks, one freedman, and one fugitive slave), planned to seize the armory and use weapons stored there to arm black slaves in order to spark a general uprising by the slave population.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAlthough the raiders were initially successful in cutting the telegraph line and capturing the armory, they allowed a passing train to continue on to Washington, D.C., where the authorities were alerted to the attack. By October 17 the raiders were surrounded in the armory by the militia and other locals. [[Robert E. Lee]] (then a colonel in the U.S. Army) led a company of U.S. Marines in storming the armory on October 18. Ten of the raiders were killed, including both of Brown's sons; Brown himself along with a half dozen of his followers were captured; four of the raiders escaped immediate capture. Six locals were killed and nine injured; the Marines suffered one dead and one injured. The local slave population failed to join in Brown's attack.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nBrown was subsequently hanged for treason ([[Virginia v. John Brown|against the Commonwealth of Virginia]]), as were six of his followers. The raid became a [[:wikt:cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre|cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] in both the North and the South, with Brown vilified by Southerners as a bloodthirsty fanatic, but celebrated by many Northern abolitionists as a martyr to the cause of ending slavery.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Elections of 1860===\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|right|thumb|350px|1860 electoral map]]\n{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1860}}\n\nInitially, [[William H. Seward]] of New York, [[Salmon P. Chase]] of Ohio, and [[Simon Cameron]] of Pennsylvania were the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. But [[Abraham Lincoln]], a former one-term House member who gained fame amid the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates]] of 1858, had fewer political opponents within the party and outmaneuvered the other contenders. On May 16, 1860, he received the Republican nomination at their convention in [[Chicago]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe schism in the Democratic Party over the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and Douglas' [[Freeport Doctrine]] caused Southern \"[[Fire-Eaters]]\" to oppose front runner [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Douglas defeated the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas because the majority of Kansans were antislavery, and Douglas' popular sovereignty doctrine would allow the majority to vote slavery up or down as they chose. Douglas' Freeport Doctrine alleged that the antislavery majority of Kansans could thwart the [[Dred Scott]] decision that allowed slavery by withholding legislation for a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. As a result, Southern extremists demanded a slave code for the territories, and used this issue to divide the northern and southern wings of the Democratic Party. Southerners left the party and in June nominated [[John C. Breckinridge]], while Northern Democrats supported Douglas. As a result, the Southern planter class lost a considerable measure of sway in national politics. Because of the Democrats' division, the Republican nominee faced a divided opposition. Adding to Lincoln's advantage, ex-[[United States Whig Party|Whigs]] from the border states had earlier formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], nominating [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John C. Bell]] for president. Thus, party nominees waged regional campaigns. Douglas and Lincoln competed for Northern votes, while Bell, Douglas and Breckinridge competed for Southern votes.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Result and impact of the election of 1860====\nLincoln handily won the electoral votes:<ref>{{cite web|title=1860 Presidential Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1860|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref>\n* '''''Abraham Lincoln: 180 (39.7% of the [[Direct election|popular vote]])'''''\n* '''J.C.

Douglas''': 12 (29.5% of the popular vote)\nVoting [on November 6, 1860] split sharply along sectional lines. Lincoln was elected by carrying the electoral votes of the North; he had a sweeping majority of 180 electoral votes. Given the vote count in each state, he would still have won the electoral college even if all three opponents had somehow been able to merge their tickets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Split in the Democratic Party===\nThe Alabama extremist [[William Lowndes Yancey]]'s demand for a federal slave code for the territories split the Democratic Party between North and South, which made the election of Lincoln possible. Yancey tried to make his demand for a slave code moderate enough to get Southern support and yet extreme enough to enrage Northerners and split the party. He demanded that the party support a slave code for the territories ''if later necessary'', so that the demand would be conditional enough to win Southern support. His tactic worked, and lower South delegates left the Democratic Convention at Institute Hall in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and walked over to Military Hall. The South Carolina extremist [[Robert Barnwell Rhett]] hoped that the lower South would completely break with the Northern Democrats and attend a separate convention at [[Richmond, Virginia]], but lower South delegates gave the national Democrats one last chance at unification by going to the convention at [[Baltimore, Maryland]], before the split became permanent. The end result was that [[John C. Breckinridge]] became the candidate of the Southern Democrats, and [[Stephen Douglas]] became the candidate of the Northern Democrats.<ref name=\"DemocraticPartySplit\">William W, Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854\u20131861'', pages 271\u2013341</ref>\n\nYancey's previous 1848 attempt at demanding a slave code for the territories was his [[Alabama Platform]], which was in response to the Northern [[Wilmot Proviso]] attempt at banning slavery in territories conquered from [[Mexico]]. Justice [[Peter V. Daniel]] wrote a letter about the Proviso to former President [[Martin Van Buren]]: \"It is that view of the case which pretends to an insulting exclusiveness or superiority on the one hand, and denounces a degrading inequality or inferiority on the other; which says in effect to the Southern man, 'Avaunt! you are not my equal, and hence are to be excluded as carrying a moral taint with you.' Here is at once the extinction of all fraternity, of all sympathy, of all endurance even; the creation of animosity fierce, implacable, undying.\"<ref>Don E. Fehrenbacher (1978/2001), New York: Oxford, Part III, ''Echoes and Consequences'', Chapter 22, \"Reasons Why\" [cf. \"[[Charge of the Light Brigade]]\"], p. 561; Daniel to Van Buren, November 1, 1847, Martin Van Buren Papers, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress.</ref> Both the Alabama Platform and the Wilmot Proviso failed, but Yancey learned to be less overtly radical in order to get more support. Southerners thought they were merely demanding equality, in that they wanted Southern property in slaves to get the same (or more) protection as Northern forms of property.<ref name=\"DemocraticPartySplit\" />\n\n===Southern secession===\n[[File:Charleston Mercury Secession Broadside, 1860.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The first published Confederate imprint of secession]]\nWith the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West\u2014the focal point of sectional tensions\u2014was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But Democrats suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.<ref>Roy Nichols, ''The Disruption of American Democracy: A History of the Political Crisis That Led up to the Civil War'' (1949)</ref>\n\nImmediately after finding out the election results, a special [[South Carolina]] convention declared \"that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states under the name of the 'United States of America' is hereby dissolved;\" by February six more cotton states would follow (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas), forming the [[Confederate States of America]]. In 1960, Lipset examined the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860\u201361. In each state he divided the counties by the proportion of slaves, low, medium and high. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties, the vote was only 37% for secession, and in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was at 60%.<ref>Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (Doubleday, 1960) p. 349.</ref> Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and the incoming Lincoln administration refused to recognize the legality of secession or the legitimacy of the Confederacy. After Lincoln called for troops, four border states (that lacked cotton) seceded (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee).<ref>Maury Klein, ''Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War'' (1999)</ref> The Upper Southern States were in a dilemma: they wanted to retain their slaves but were afraid that if they joined with the lower southern states that were rebelling they would be caught in the middle of a conflict, and their states would be the battle ground. By staying in the Union the Upper Southern states felt that their slave rights would continue to be recognized by the Union.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Other issues===\nThe [[tariff]] issue was and is sometimes cited\u2013long after the war\u2013by [[Lost Cause]] historians and [[neo-Confederate]] apologists. In 1860\u201361 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession brought up the tariff issue as a major issue.<ref>Robert Gray Gunderson, ''Old Gentleman's Convention: The Washington Peace Conference of 1861''.

Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion, Secessionists Triumphant: 1854\u20131861'', pages 345\u2013516</ref>\n\nThese issues were especially important in the lower South, where 47 percent of the population were slaves. The upper South, where 32 percent of the population were slaves, considered the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter crisis]]\u2014especially [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|Lincoln's call for troops]] to march south to recapture it\u2014a cause for secession. The northernmost border slave states, where 13 percent of the population were slaves, did not secede.<ref>Daniel Crofts, ''Reluctant Confederates: Upper South Unionists in the Secession Crisis'' (1989)</ref>\n\n==Fort Sumter==\nWhen [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina seceded]] in December 1860, Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]], a pro-slavery, former slave owner from [[Kentucky]], remained loyal to the Union. He was the commanding officer of United States Army forces in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]\u2014the last remaining important Union post in the [[Deep South]]. Acting upon orders from the War Department to hold and defend the U.S. forts, he moved his small garrison from [[Fort Moultrie]], which was indefensible, to the more modern, more defensible, [[Fort Sumter]] in the middle of [[Charleston Harbor]]. South Carolina leaders cried betrayal, while the North celebrated with enormous excitement at this show of defiance against secessionism. In February 1861 the [[Confederate States of America]] were formed and took charge. Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, ordered the fort be captured. The artillery attack was commanded by [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[P. G. T. Beauregard]], who had been Anderson's student at West Point. The attack began April 12, 1861, and continued until Anderson, badly outnumbered and outgunned, surrendered the fort on April 14. The battle began the American Civil War, as an overwhelming demand for war swept both the North and South, with only Kentucky attempting to remain neutral.<ref>Adam Goodheart, ''1861: The Civil War Awakening '' (2011) ch 2\u20135</ref>\n[[File:Fort Sumter telegram.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Robert Anderson's telegram announcing the surrender of Fort Sumter]]\n\nAccording to Adam Goodheart (2011), the modern meaning of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] was also forged in the defense of Fort Sumter. Thereafter, the flag was used throughout the North to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\n\n{{quote|Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like the [[Fourth of July]]. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew \u2013 as it does today, and especially as it did after [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] \u2013 from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.<ref>Adam Goodheart, \"Prologue\", in  ''1861: The Civil War Awakening '' (2011)</ref>}}\n\n==Onset of the Civil War and the question of compromise==\n[[File:HenryWilson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Wilson]], author of ''[[History of The Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America]]'' (1872\u20131877)]]\n\nAbraham Lincoln's rejection of the [[Crittenden Compromise]], the failure to secure the ratification of the [[Corwin Amendment]] in 1861, and the inability of the Washington [[Peace Conference of 1861]] to provide an effective alternative to Crittenden and Corwin came together to prevent a compromise that is still debated by Civil War historians. Even as the war was going on, William Seward and James Buchanan were outlining a debate over the question of inevitability that would continue among historians.<ref>Steven E. Woodworth, ed., ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996) pp 131-43</ref>\n\n===Needless war argument===\nTwo competing explanations of the sectional tensions inflaming the nation emerged even before the war. The first was the \"Needless War\" argument.<ref>Thomas J. Pressly, ''Americans Interpret Their Civil War'' (1954) pp 127-48</ref> Buchanan believed the sectional hostility to be the accidental, unnecessary work of self-interested or fanatical agitators. He also singled out the \"fanaticism\" of the Republican Party. Seward, on the other hand, believed there to be an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces. Shelden argues that, \"Few scholars in the twenty-first century would call the Civil War 'needless,' as the emancipation of 4 million slaves hinged on Union victory.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Rachel A. Shelden|title=Washington Brotherhood: Politics, Social Life, and the Coming of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZj9AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|year=2013|publisher=U of North Carolina Press|page=5}}</ref>\n\n===Irrepressible conflict argument===\nThe \"Irrepressible Conflict\" argument was the first to dominate historical discussion.<ref>Thomas J. Pressly, ''Americans Interpret Their Civil War'' (1954) pp 149-226</ref> In the first decades after the fighting, histories of the Civil War generally reflected the views of Northerners who had participated in the conflict. The war appeared to be a stark moral conflict in which the South was to blame, a conflict that arose as a result of the designs of slave power. [[Henry Wilson]]'s ''[[History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America]]'' (1872\u20131877) is the foremost representative of this moral interpretation, which argued that Northerners had fought to preserve the union against the aggressive designs of \"slave power\". Later, in his seven-volume ''History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 to the Civil War'' (1893\u20131900), [[James Ford Rhodes]] identified slavery as the central\u2014and virtually only\u2014cause of the Civil War. The North and South had reached positions on the issue of slavery that were both irreconcilable and unalterable. The conflict had become inevitable.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n===Revisionists===\nBut the idea that the war was avoidable became central among historians in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Revisionist historians, led by [[James G. Randall]] (1881\u20131953) at the University of Illinois and [[Avery Craven]] (1885\u20131980) at the University of Chicago, saw in the social and economic systems of the South no differences so fundamental as to require a war. Historian [[Mark E. Neely Jr.|Mark Neely]] explains their position:\n\n<blockquote>Revisionism challenged the view that fundamental and irreconcilable sectional differences made the outbreak of war inevitable. It scorned a previous generation's easy identification of the Northern cause with abolition, but it continued a tradition of hostility to the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] measures that followed the war. The Civil War became a needless conflict brought on by a blundering generation that exaggerated sectional differences between North and South. Revisionists revived the reputation of the Democratic party as great nationalists before the war and as dependable loyalists during it. Revisionism gave Lincoln's Presidency a tragic beginning at Fort Sumter, a rancorous political setting of bitter factional conflicts between radicals and moderates within Lincoln's own party, and an even more tragic ending. The benevolent Lincoln died at the moment when benevolence was most needed to blunt radical designs for revenge on the South.<ref>Mark E. Neely, \"The Lincoln Theme since Randall's Call: The Promises and Perils of Professionalism.\" ''Papers of the Abraham Lincoln Association'' 1 (1979): 10-70. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0001.104/--lincoln-theme-since-randalls-call-the-promises-and-perils?rgn=main;view=fulltext online]</ref></blockquote>\n\nRandall blamed the ineptitude of a \"blundering generation\" of leaders. He also saw slavery as essentially a benign institution, crumbling in the presence of 19th century tendencies.<ref>James G. Randall, \"The Blundering Generation.\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 27.1 (1940): 3-28. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1896569 in JSTOR]</ref> Craven, the other leading revisionist, placed more emphasis on the issue of slavery than Randall but argued roughly the same points. In ''The Coming of the Civil War'' (1942), Craven argued that slave laborers were not much worse off than Northern workers, that the institution was already on the road to ultimate extinction, and that the war could have been averted by skillful and responsible leaders in the tradition of Congressional statesmen [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. Two of the key leaders in antebellum politics, Clay and Webster, in contrast to the 1850s generation of leaders, shared a predisposition to compromises marked by a passionate patriotic devotion to the Union.<ref>Avery Craven, ''The Coming of the Civil War'' (1942).</ref><ref>Avery Craven, \"Coming of the War Between the States: An Interpretation.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 2#3 (1936): 303-322. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2191911 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nBut it is possible that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of the political debate). [[David Herbert Donald]] (1920\u20132009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in a society in which traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.<ref>David H. Donald, \"Died of Democracy.\" in Donald, ed., ''Why the North Won the Civil War'' (1960) pp: 79-90.</ref>\n\n==Contemporaneous explanations==\n<div class=\"noprint\" style=\"clear:right; float:right; margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; width:250px; border:solid #aaa 1px; padding:4px; background:#f9f9f9; spacing:0px; text-align:left; font-size:90%;\">\n<div style=\"float:left;\">[[File:wikisource-logo.jpg|50px|none|Wikisource]]</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:60px;\">[[Wikisource]] has the original text of\n<div style=\"margin-left:10px;\">\"'''[[s:The Barbarism of Slavery|The Barbarism of Slavery]]'''\"</div>\n</div></div>\n\nIn December 1860, amid the secession crisis, president-elect Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter to [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]], in which he summarized the cause of the crisis:\n\n{{quote|You think slavery is right and should be extended; while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted. That I suppose is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference between us.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=To Alexander H. Stephens|date=December 22, 1860|url=http://www.civilwarcauses.org/aleck.htm|work=Civil War Causes|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nSeveral months later, on March 21, 1861, Alexander Stephens, now the Confederate vice president, delivered his \"[[Cornerstone Speech]]\" in Savannah, Georgia. In the speech, he states that slavery was the cause of the secession crisis, and outlines the principal differences between Confederate ideology and U.S. ideology:\n\n{{quote|The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions\u2014African slavery as it exists among us\u2014the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. ...{{bracket|Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's}} ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. ...Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery \u2013 subordination to the superior race \u2013 is his natural and normal condition.}}\n\nIn July 1863, as decisive campaigns were fought at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], Republican senator [[Charles Sumner]] re-dedicated his speech [[S:The Barbarism of Slavery|The Barbarism of Slavery]] and said that desire to preserve slavery was the sole cause of the war:\n\n{{quote|[T]here are two apparent rudiments to this war. One is Slavery and the other is State Rights. But the latter is only a cover for the former. If Slavery were out of the way there would be no trouble from State Rights.\n\nThe war, then, is for Slavery, and nothing else. It is an insane attempt to vindicate by arms the lordship which had been already asserted in debate. With mad-cap audacity it seeks to install this Barbarism as the truest Civilization. Slavery is declared to be the \"corner-stone\" of the new edifice.}}\n\nLincoln's war goals were reactions to the war, as opposed to causes. Abraham Lincoln explained the nationalist goal as the preservation of the Union on August 22, 1862, one month before his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation:\n\n{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be \"the Union as it was.\"... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. ...I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.<ref>[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm Letter to Horace Greeley], August 22, 1862</ref>}}\n\nOn March 4, 1865, Lincoln said in his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] that slavery was the cause of the War:\n\n{{quote|One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[American Civil War]]\n* [[Compensated emancipation]]\n* [[Conclusion of the American Civil War]]\n* [[Issues of the American Civil War]]\n* [[Slavery in the United States]]\n* [[Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Craven, Avery.

While virtually all historians in the 21st century agree that conflicts over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] caused the war, they disagree sharply regarding which kinds of conflict\u2014ideological, economic, political, or social\u2014were most important.<ref>Aaron Sheehan-Dean, \"A Book for Every Perspective: Current Civil War and Reconstruction Textbooks,\" ''Civil War History'' (2005) 51#3 pp 317\u2013324</ref>\n\nThe primary catalyst for secession was slavery, most immediately the political battle over the right of Southerners to bring slavery into western territory that had hitherto been free under the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]] or [[Mexican\u2013American War|while part of Mexico]]. Another factor for secession and the formation of the Confederacy, was [[White Southerners|white Southern nationalism]].<ref>John McCardell, ''The Idea of a Southern Nation: Southern Nationalists and Southern Nationalism, 1830\u20131860'' (1981)</ref> The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union, a cause based on [[American nationalism]].<ref>Susan-Mary Grant, ''North Over South: Northern Nationalism and American Identity in the Antebellum Era'' (2000)</ref> Most of the debate is about the first question, as to why some Southern states decided to secede.\n\n[[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]] without being on the ballot in ten Southern states. His victory triggered declarations of [[Secession in the United States|secession]] by seven [[Slave and free states|slave states]] of the [[Deep South]], whose riverfront or coastal economies were all based on cotton cultivated using slave labor. They formed the Confederate States of America after Lincoln was elected, but before he [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|took office]]. Nationalists in the North and \"Unionists\" in the South refused to recognize the declarations of secession. No foreign government ever recognized the Confederacy. The U.S. government under President [[James Buchanan]] refused to relinquish its forts that were in territory claimed by the Confederacy. The war itself began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces bombarded]] [[Fort Sumter]], a major U.S. fortress in the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]].\n\nAs a panel of historians emphasized in 2011, \"while slavery and its various and multifaceted discontents were the primary cause of disunion, it was disunion itself that sparked the war.\"<ref>[[Elizabeth R.

Their growth was fed by a high birth rate and large numbers of European immigrants, especially British, Irish and Germans. The South was dominated by a settled [[Plantation economy|plantation system]] based on slavery; there was some rapid growth taking place in the Southwest (e.g., [[Texas]]), based on high birth rates and high migration from the Southeast; there was also immigration by Europeans, but in much smaller number. The heavily rural South had few cities of any size, and little manufacturing except in border areas such as [[St. Louis]] and [[Baltimore]]. Slave owners controlled politics and the economy, although about 75% of white Southern families owned no slaves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Boyer|title=The Enduring Vision, Volume I: To 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqawVJRMd8YC&pg=PA343|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=343|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n[[File:US Secession map 1861.svg|thumb|300px|right|1861 United States Secession Crisis map.<br>Legend:\n{{legend|#A40000| States that seceded before April 15, 1861}}\n\n{{legend|#EF2929| States that seceded after April 15, 1861}}\n\n{{legend|#FCE94F| States that permitted slavery, but did not secede}}\n\n{{legend|#204A87| States of the Union that banned slavery}}\n\n{{legend|#D3D7CF| U.S. territories, under [[Union Army]] control}}|alt=1861 Map of U.S. states and territories showing two phases of secession]]\nOverall, the Northern population was growing much more quickly than the Southern population, which made it increasingly difficult for the South to continue to influence the national government. By the time the 1860 election occurred, the heavily agricultural southern states as a group had fewer [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes than the rapidly [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] northern states. Abraham Lincoln was able to win the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]] without even being on the ballot in ten Southern states. Southerners felt a loss of federal concern for Southern pro-slavery political demands, and their continued domination of the federal government was threatened. This political calculus provided a very real basis for Southerners' worry about the relative political decline of their region, due to the North growing much faster in terms of population and industrial output.\n\nIn the interest of maintaining unity, politicians had mostly moderated opposition to slavery, resulting in numerous compromises such as the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 under the presidency of [[James Monroe]]. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846 to 1848, the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the new [[Historic regions of the United States|territories]] led to the [[Compromise of 1850]]. While the compromise averted an immediate political crisis, it did not permanently resolve the issue of the [[Slave Power]] (the power of slaveholders to control the national government on the slavery issue). Part of the Compromise of 1850 was the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which many Northerners found to be extremely offensive, and required that Northerners assist Southerners in reclaiming fugitive slaves.\n\nAmid the emergence of increasingly virulent and hostile sectional ideologies in national politics, the collapse of the old [[Second Party System]] in the 1850s hampered politicians' efforts to reach yet another compromise. The compromise that was reached (the 1854 [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]) outraged many Northerners, and led to the formation of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the first major party that was almost entirely Northern-based. The industrializing North and agrarian Midwest became committed to the economic ethos of free-labor [[industrial capitalism]].\n\nArguments that slavery was undesirable for the nation had long existed, and early in U.S. history were made even by some prominent Southerners. After 1840, abolitionists denounced slavery as not only a social evil but a moral wrong. Activists in the new Republican Party, usually Northerners, had another view: they believed the Slave Power conspiracy was controlling the national government with the goal of extending slavery.<ref name=\"Leonard L.

It was most important in the six southern states from Maryland to Georgia, but the total of a half million slaves were spread out through all of the colonies. In the South, 40% of the population was made up of slaves, and as Americans moved into Kentucky and the rest of the southwest, one-sixth of the settlers were slaves. By the end of the Revolutionary War, the [[New England]] states provided most of the American ships that were used in the foreign slave trade, while most of their customers were in Georgia and [[the Carolinas]].<ref>Fehrenbacher pp.15\u201317. Fehrenbacher wrote, \"As a racial caste system, slavery was the most distinctive element in the southern social order. The slave production of [[staple crop]]s dominated southern agriculture and eminently suited the development of a national market economy.\"</ref>\n\nDuring this time many Americans found it difficult to reconcile slavery with their interpretation of Christianity and the lofty sentiments that flowed from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. A small antislavery movement, led by the [[Quakers]], had some impact in the 1780s, and by the late 1780s all of the states except for Georgia had placed some restrictions on their participation in slave trafficking. Still, no serious national political movement against slavery developed, largely due to the overriding concern over achieving national unity.<ref>Fehrenbacher pp. 16\u201318</ref> When the Constitutional Convention met, slavery was the one issue \"that left the least possibility of compromise, the one that would most pit morality against pragmatism.\"<ref>Goldstone p. 13</ref> In the end, while many would take comfort in the fact that the word \"slavery\" never occurs in the Constitution, critics note that the [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three-fifths clause]] provided slaveholders with extra representatives in Congress, the requirement of the federal government to suppress domestic violence would dedicate national resources to defending against slave revolts, a twenty-year delay in banning the import of slaves allowed the South to fortify its labor needs, and the amendment process made the national abolition of slavery very unlikely in the foreseeable future.<ref>McDougall p. 318</ref>\n\nWith the outlawing of the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|African slave trade]] on January 1, 1808, many Americans felt that the slavery issue was resolved.<ref>Forbes p. 4</ref> Any national discussion that might have continued over slavery was drowned out by the years of trade embargoes, maritime competition with Great Britain and France, and, finally, the [[War of 1812]]. The one exception to this quiet regarding slavery was the New Englanders' association of their frustration with the war with their resentment of the three-fifths clause that seemed to allow the South to dominate national politics.<ref>Mason pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nDuring and in the aftermath of the American Revolution (1775\u20131783), the northern states (north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] separating Pennsylvania from Maryland and Delaware) abolished slavery by 1804, although in some states existing slaves were not liberated immediately. In the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, Congress (still under the [[Articles of Confederation]]) barred slavery from the Midwestern territory north of the [[Ohio River]], but when Congress organized the southern territories acquired through the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the ban on slavery was omitted.\n\n===Missouri Compromise===\n{{Main|Missouri Compromise}}\n\nIn 1819 Congressman [[James Tallmadge Jr.]] of New York initiated an uproar in the South when he proposed two amendments to a bill admitting [[Missouri]] to the Union as a free state. The first barred slaves from being moved to Missouri, and the second would free all Missouri slaves born after admission to the Union at age 25.<ref>Freehling p.144</ref> With the admission of Alabama as a [[Slave states and free states|slave state]] in 1819, the U.S. was equally divided with 11 slave states and 11 free states. The admission of the new state of Missouri as a slave state would give the slave states a majority in the Senate; the [[Tallmadge Amendment]] would give the free states a majority.\n\nThe Tallmadge amendments passed the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate when five Northern senators voted with all the Southern senators.<ref>Freehling p. 149. In the House the votes for the Tallmadge amendments in the North were 86\u201310 and 80-14 in favor, while in the South the vote to oppose was 66\u20131 and 64-2.</ref> The question was now the admission of Missouri as a slave state, and many leaders shared [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s fear of a crisis over slavery\u2014a fear that Jefferson described as \"a fire bell in the night\". The crisis was solved by the [[Missouri Compromise]], in which [[Massachusetts]] agreed to cede control over its relatively large, sparsely populated and disputed [[exclave]], the [[District of Maine]]. The compromise allowed [[Maine]] to be admitted to the Union as a free state at the same time that Missouri was admitted as a slave state. The Compromise also banned slavery in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north and west of the state of Missouri along the line of 36\u201330. The Missouri Compromise quieted the issue until its limitations on slavery were repealed by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] of 1854.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Missouri.html Missouri Compromise]</ref>\n\nIn the South, the Missouri crisis reawakened old fears that a strong federal government could be a fatal threat to slavery. The [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian coalition]] that united southern planters and northern farmers, mechanics and artisans in opposition to the threat presented by the [[Federalist Party]] had started to dissolve after the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Forbes pp. 6\u20137</ref> It was not until the Missouri crisis that Americans became aware of the political possibilities of a sectional attack on slavery, and it was not until the [[mass politics]] of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s administration that this type of organization around this issue became practical.<ref>Mason p. 8</ref>\n\n===Nullification Crisis===\n[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|260px|President [[Andrew Jackson]] viewed South Carolina's attempts to nullify the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 as being tantamount to treason.

Calhoun]], was a program for rapid economic modernization featuring protective tariffs, [[internal improvements]] at federal expense, and a national bank. The purpose was to develop American industry and international commerce. Since iron, coal, and water power were mainly in the North, this tax plan was doomed to cause rancor in the South where economies were agriculture-based.<ref>[http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/solguide/VUS06/essay06c.html Leah S.

Pease, \"The Economics and Politics of Charleston's Nullification Crisis\", ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (1981), pp. 335\u2013362</ref>\n\nThe nation suffered an economic downturn throughout the 1820s, and South Carolina was particularly affected. The highly protective Tariff of 1828 (called the \"[[Tariff of Abominations]]\" by its detractors), designed to protect American industry by taxing imported manufactured goods, was enacted into law during the last year of the presidency of [[John Quincy Adams]]. Opposed in the South and parts of New England, the expectation of the tariff's opponents was that with the election of [[Andrew Jackson]] the tariff would be significantly reduced.<ref>Remini, ''Andrew Jackson'', v2 pp. 136\u2013137. Niven pg. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'' pg 143</ref>\n\nBy 1828 South Carolina state politics increasingly organized around the tariff issue. When the Jackson administration failed to take any actions to address their concerns, the most radical faction in the state began to advocate that the state declare the tariff null and void within South Carolina. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and his vice-president John C. Calhoun, the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification through his 1828 \"[[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]\".<ref>Craven pg.65. Niven pg. 135\u2013137. Freehling, ''Prelude to Civil War'' pg 143</ref>\n\nCongress enacted a new [[Tariff of 1832|tariff in 1832]], but it offered the state little relief, resulting in the most dangerous sectional crisis since the Union was formed. Some militant South Carolinians even hinted at withdrawing from the Union in response. The newly elected South Carolina legislature then quickly called for the election of delegates to a state convention. Once assembled, the convention voted to declare null and void the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 within the state. President Andrew Jackson responded firmly, declaring nullification an act of [[treason]]. He then took steps to strengthen federal forts in the state.\n\nViolence seemed a real possibility early in 1833 as Jacksonians in Congress introduced a \"[[Force Bill]]\" authorizing the President to use the federal army and navy in order to enforce acts of Congress. No other state had come forward to support South Carolina, and the state itself was divided on willingness to continue the showdown with the federal government. The crisis ended when Clay and Calhoun worked to devise a compromise tariff. Both sides later claimed victory. Calhoun and his supporters in South Carolina claimed a victory for nullification, insisting that it had forced the revision of the tariff. Jackson's followers, however, saw the episode as a demonstration that no single state could assert its rights by independent action.\n\nCalhoun, in turn, devoted his efforts to building up a sense of Southern solidarity so that when another standoff should come, the whole section might be prepared to act as a bloc in resisting the federal government. As early as 1830, in the midst of the crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves\u2014the foundation of the plantation agricultural system\u2014as the chief southern minority right being threatened:\n\n{{quote|I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick {{sic}} institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.<ref>Ellis, Richard E. ''The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis'' (1987), page 193; Freehling, William W. ''Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816\u20131836''. (1965), page 257</ref><ref>Ellis p. 193.  Ellis further notes that \"Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states' rights.  At various points in their careers, [[John Taylor of Caroline|John Taylor]], [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], and [[Nathaniel Macon]] had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners' wishes.\"</ref>}}\n\nOn May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote of this idea, \"the tariff was only the pretext, and [[Secession in the United States|disunion]] and [[Confederate States of America|southern confederacy]] the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] question.\"<ref>[[Jon Meacham]] (2009), ''[[American Lion (book)|American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House]]'', p. 247; ''Correspondence of Andrew Jackson'', Vol. V, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe issue appeared again after 1842's [[Black Tariff]]. A period of relative free trade followed 1846's [[Walker Tariff]], which had been largely written by Southerners. Northern industrialists (and some in western Virginia) complained it was too low to encourage the growth of industry.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, \"The Tariff Issue on the Eve of the Civil War.\" ''American Historical Review'' (1938) 44#1 pp: 50-55 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1840850 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Gag Rule debates===\n{{Main|Gag rule#Anti-slavery petitions in the United States Congress in 1831\u20131844}}\n\nFrom 1831 to 1836 [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AA-SS) initiated a campaign to petition Congress in favor of ending slavery in the [[District of Columbia]] and all federal territories. Hundreds of thousands of petitions were sent, with the number reaching a peak in 1835.<ref>Varon (2008) p. 109. Wilentz (2005) p. 451</ref>\n\nThe [[United States House of Representatives|House]] passed the Pinckney Resolutions on May 26, 1836. The first of these stated that Congress had no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states and the second that it \"ought not\" do so in the District of Columbia. The third resolution, known from the beginning as the \"gag rule\", provided that:\n\n{{quote|All petitions, memorials, resolutions, propositions, or papers, relating in any way, or to any extent whatsoever, to the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being either printed or referred, be laid on the table and that no further action whatever shall be had thereon.<ref>Miller (1995) pp. 144\u2013146</ref>}}\n\nThe first two resolutions passed by votes of 182 to 9 and 132 to 45. The gag rule, supported by Northern and Southern Democrats as well as some Southern Whigs, was passed with a vote of 117 to 68.<ref>Miller (1995) pp. 209\u2013210</ref>\n\nFormer President [[John Quincy Adams]], who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1830, became an early and central figure in the opposition to the gag rules.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 470\u2013472</ref> He argued that they were a direct violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". A majority of Northern [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] joined the opposition. Rather than suppress anti-slavery petitions, however, the gag rules only served to offend Americans from Northern states, and dramatically increase the number of petitions.<ref>Miller, 112</ref>\n\nSince the original gag was a resolution, not a standing House Rule, it had to be renewed every session, and the Adams' faction often gained the floor before the gag could be imposed. However in January 1840, the House of Representatives passed the Twenty-first Rule, which prohibited even the reception of anti-slavery petitions and was a standing House rule. Now the pro-petition forces focused on trying to revoke a standing rule. The Rule raised serious doubts about its constitutionality and had less support than the original Pinckney gag, passing only by 114 to 108. Throughout the gag period, Adams' \"superior talent in using and abusing parliamentary rules\" and skill in baiting his enemies into making mistakes, enabled him to evade the rule and debate the slavery issues. The gag rule was finally rescinded on December 3, 1844, by a strongly sectional vote of 108 to 80, all the Northern and four Southern Whigs voting for repeal, along with 55 of the 71 Northern Democrats.<ref>Miller, pp. 476, 479\u2013481</ref>\n\n===Antebellum South and the Union===\nThere had been a continuing contest between the states and the national government over the power of the latter\u2014and over the loyalty of the citizenry\u2014almost since the founding of the republic. The [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] of 1798, for example, had defied the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], and at the [[Hartford Convention]], [[New England]] voiced its opposition to President [[James Madison]] and the [[War of 1812]], and discussed secession from the Union.\n\n====Southern culture====\n[[File:Cottonfieldpanorama-edited.jpg|thumb|center|580px|Picking [[cotton]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]]]\n{{See also|Slavery in the United States}}\n\nAlthough a minority of free Southerners owned slaves, free Southerners of all classes nevertheless defended the institution of slavery<ref>Huston p. 41. Huston writes, \"... on at least three matters southerners were united. First, slaves were property. Second, the sanctity of Southerners' property rights in slaves was beyond the questioning of anyone inside or outside of the South. Third, slavery was the only means of adjusting social relations properly between Europeans and Africans.\"</ref>\u2014threatened by the rise of free labor abolitionist movements in the Northern states\u2014as the cornerstone of their social order.\n\nPer the 1860 census, the percentage of slaveholding families was as follows:<ref>Bonekemper III, Edward H. (2015) ''The Myth of the Lost Cause: Why the South fought the Civil War and Why the North Won''. Regnery Publishing pg 39</ref>\n\n*26% in the 15 Slave states (AL, AR, DE, FL, GA, KY, LA, MD, MS, MO, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA)\n*16% in the 4 Border states (DE, KY, MD, MO)\n*31% in the 11 Confederate states (AL, AR, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, VA)\n*37% in the first 7 Confederate states (AL, FL, GA, LA, MS, SC, TX)\n*25% in the second 4 Confederate states (AR, NC, TN, VA)\n\nMississippi was the highest at 49%, followed by South Carolina at 46%\n\nBased on a system of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] slavery, the social structure of the South was far more stratified and patriarchal than that of the North. In 1850 there were around 350,000 slaveholders in a total free Southern population of about six million. Among slaveholders, the concentration of slave ownership was unevenly distributed. Perhaps around 7 percent of slaveholders owned roughly three-quarters of the slave population. The largest slaveholders, generally owners of large plantations, represented the top stratum of Southern society. They benefited from [[economies of scale]] and needed large numbers of slaves on big plantations to produce cotton, a highly profitable labor-intensive crop.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nPer the 1860 Census, in the 15 slave states, slaveholders owning 30 or more slaves (6.5% of all slaveholders) owned approximately 1,540,000 slaves (39% of all slaves).<ref>https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860b-08.pdf</ref>(PDF Pg 64/1860 Census pg 247)\n\nIn the 1850s, as large plantation owners outcompeted smaller farmers, more slaves were owned by fewer planters. Yet poor whites and small farmers generally accepted the political leadership of the planter elite. Several factors helped explain why slavery was not under serious threat of internal collapse from any move for democratic change initiated from the South. First, given the opening of new territories in the West for white settlement, many non-slaveowners also perceived a possibility that they, too, might own slaves at some point in their life.<ref name=\"Brinkley, 1986\">{{cite book |last=Brinkley |first=Alan |title=American History: A Survey |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1986 |page=328}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Violent repression of slaves was a common theme in abolitionist literature in the North. Above, this famous 1863 photo of a slave, [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], deeply scarred from whipping by an overseer, was distributed by abolitionists to illustrate what they saw as the barbarism of Southern society.]]\n\nSecond, small free farmers in the South often embraced [[Racism in the United States|racism]], making them unlikely agents for internal democratic reforms in the South.<ref name=\"Moore, 1966\">{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Barrington |title=Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialoriginsofd00barr |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Beacon Press |year=1966 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialoriginsofd00barr/page/117 117]}}</ref> The principle of [[white supremacy]], accepted by almost all white southerners of all classes, made slavery seem legitimate, natural, and essential for a civilized society. White racism in the South was sustained by official systems of repression such as the \"slave codes\" and elaborate codes of speech, behavior, and social practices illustrating the subordination of blacks to whites. For example, the \"[[slave patrol]]s\" were among the institutions bringing together southern whites of all classes in support of the prevailing economic and racial order. Serving as slave \"patrollers\" and \"overseers\" offered white southerners positions of power and honor. Slave \"patrollers\" and \"overseers\" also won prestige in their communities. Policing and punishing blacks who transgressed the regimentation of slave society was a valued community service in the South, where the fear of free blacks threatening law and order figured heavily in the public discourse of the period.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThird, many [[yeoman|yeomen]] and small farmers with a few slaves were linked to elite planters through the market economy.<ref name=\"North, 1961\">{{cite book |last=North |first=Douglas C. |title=The Economic Growth of the United States 1790\u20131860 |publisher=Englewood Cliffs |year=1961 |page=130}}</ref> In many areas, small farmers depended on local planter elites for vital goods and services, including access to [[cotton gin]]s, markets, feed and livestock, and even loans (since the banking system was not well developed in the antebellum South). Southern tradesmen often depended on the richest planters for steady work. Such dependency effectively deterred many white non-slaveholders from engaging in any political activity that was not in the interest of the large slaveholders. Furthermore, whites of varying social class, including poor whites and \"plain folk\" who worked outside or in the periphery of the market economy (and therefore lacked any real economic interest in the defense of slavery) might nonetheless be linked to elite planters through extensive kinship networks. Since [[inheritance]] in the South was often unequitable (and generally favored eldest sons), it was not uncommon for a poor white person to be perhaps the first cousin of the richest plantation owner of his county and to share the same militant support of slavery as his richer relatives. Finally, there was no [[secret ballot]] at the time anywhere in the United States \u2013 this innovation did not become widespread in the U.S. until the 1880s. For a typical white Southerner, this meant that so much as casting a ballot against the wishes of the establishment meant running the risk of being socially [[:ostracized]].{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThus, by the 1850s, Southern slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike felt increasingly encircled psychologically and politically in the national political arena because of the rise of [[free soil]]ism and [[abolitionism]] in the Northern states. Increasingly dependent on the North for manufactured goods, for commercial services, and for loans, and increasingly cut off from the flourishing agricultural regions of the Northwest, they faced the prospects of a growing free labor and abolitionist movement in the North.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nHistorian [[William C.

They prayed to the same deity, spoke the same language, shared the same ancestry, sang the same songs. National triumphs and catastrophes were shared by both.\" He stated that culture was not the cause of the war, but rather, slavery was: \"For all the myths they would create to the contrary, the only significant and defining difference between them was slavery, where it existed and where it did not, for by 1804 it had virtually ceased to exist north of Maryland.

Southerners waged a vitriolic response to political change in the North. Slaveholding interests sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse \"hostile\" and \"ruinous\" legislation. Behind this shift was the growth of the cotton textile industry in the North and in Europe, which left slavery more important than ever to the Southern economy.<ref>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Eugene D. Genovese, ''Slavery in White and Black: Class and Race in the Southern Slaveholders' New World Order'' (2008)</ref>\n\n====Abolitionism====\nSouthern spokesmen greatly exaggerated the power of abolitionists, looking especially at the great popularity of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), the novel and play by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] (whom Abraham Lincoln reputedly called \"the little woman that started this great war\"). They saw a vast growing abolitionist movement after the success of ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' in 1831 by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. The fear was a [[race war]] by blacks that would massacre whites, especially in counties where whites were a small minority.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley Harrold|title=The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKQeBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|year=2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=45, 149\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe South reacted with an elaborate intellectual defense of slavery. [[J. D. B. De Bow]] of New Orleans established ''[[De Bow's Review]]'' in 1846, which quickly grew to become the leading Southern magazine, warning about the dangers of depending on the North economically. ''De Bow's Review'' also emerged as the leading voice for secession. The magazine emphasized the South's economic inequality, relating it to the concentration of manufacturing, shipping, banking and international trade in the North. Searching for Biblical passages endorsing slavery and forming economic, sociological, historical and scientific arguments, slavery went from being a \"necessary evil\" to a \"positive good\". Dr. [[John H. Van Evrie]]'s book ''Negroes and Negro slavery: The First an Inferior Race: The Latter Its Normal Condition''\u2014setting out the arguments the title would suggest\u2014was an attempt to apply scientific support to the Southern arguments in favor of race-based slavery.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fleshing Out America: Race, Gender, and the Politics of the Body in American Literature, 1833\u20131879|page=19|first=Carolyn|last=Sorisio|date=2002|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|location=Athens|isbn=0820326372|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8t1wHF4Z24C|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nLatent sectional divisions suddenly activated derogatory sectional imagery which emerged into sectional ideologies. As industrial capitalism gained momentum in the North, Southern writers emphasized whatever aristocratic traits they valued (but often did not practice) in their own society: courtesy, grace, [[chivalry]], the slow pace of life, orderly life and leisure. This supported their argument that slavery provided a more humane society than industrial labor.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Peter P. Hinks|author2=John R.

He advocated enslaving Northern factory workers, for their own benefit. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, denounced such Southern insinuations that Northern wage earners were fatally fixed in that condition for life. To Free Soilers, the stereotype of the South was one of a diametrically opposite, static society in which the slave system maintained an entrenched anti-democratic aristocracy.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n====Southern fears of modernization====\nAccording to the historian [[James M. McPherson]], exceptionalism applied not to the South but to the North after the North ended slavery and launched an industrial revolution that led to urbanization, which in turn led to increased education, which in its own turn gave ever-increasing strength to various reform movements but especially abolitionism. The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North (and the fact that most immigrants viewed slavery with disfavor), compounded by the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior. The ''[[Charleston Mercury]]'' read that on the issue of slavery the North and South \"are not only two Peoples, but they are rival, hostile Peoples.\"<ref name=\"McPhersonExceptionalism\">[[James M. McPherson]], \"Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question\", ''Civil War History'' 29 (September 1983)</ref> As ''De Bow's Review'' said, \"We are resisting revolution. ... We are not engaged in a Quixotic fight for the rights of man. ... We are conservative.\"<ref name=\"McPhersonExceptionalism\" />\n\n====Southern fears of modernity====\n[[Allan Nevins]] argued that the Civil War was an \"irrepressible\" conflict, adopting a phrase from Senator [[William H. Seward]]. Nevins synthesized contending accounts emphasizing moral, cultural, social, ideological, political, and economic issues. In doing so, he brought the historical discussion back to an emphasis on social and cultural factors. Nevins pointed out that the North and the South were rapidly becoming two different peoples, a point made also by historian [[Avery Craven]]. At the root of these cultural differences was the problem of slavery, but fundamental assumptions, tastes, and cultural aims of the regions were diverging in other ways as well. More specifically, the North was rapidly modernizing in a manner threatening to the South. Historian McPherson explains:<ref name=\"McPhersonExceptionalism\" />\n\n<blockquote> When secessionists protested in 1861 that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values, they were correct. They fought to preserve their constitutional liberties against the perceived Northern threat to overthrow them. The South's concept of republicanism had not changed in three-quarters of a century; the North's had. ... The ascension to power of the Republican Party, with its ideology of competitive, egalitarian free-labor capitalism, was a signal to the South that the Northern majority had turned irrevocably towards this frightening, revolutionary future.</blockquote>\n\nHarry L. Watson has synthesized research on antebellum southern social, economic, and political history. Self-sufficient [[Yeoman|yeomen]], in Watson's view, \"collaborated in their own transformation\" by allowing promoters of a market economy to gain political influence. Resultant \"doubts and frustrations\" provided fertile soil for the argument that southern rights and liberties were menaced by Black Republicanism.<ref>\"Conflict and Collaboration: Yeomen, Slaveholders, and Politics in the Antebellum South\", ''Social History'' 10 (October 1985): 273\u201398. quote at p. 297.</ref>\n\nJ. Mills Thornton III explained the viewpoint of the average white Alabamian. Thornton contends that Alabama was engulfed in a severe crisis long before 1860. Deeply held principles of freedom, equality, and autonomy, as expressed in [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican values]], appeared threatened, especially during the 1850s, by the relentless expansion of market relations and commercial agriculture. Alabamians were thus, he judged, prepared to believe the worst once Lincoln was elected.<ref>Thornton, ''Politics and Power in a Slave Society: Alabama, 1800\u20131860'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1978)</ref>\n\n===Sectional tensions and the emergence of mass politics===\n{{quote box\n|align = left\n|width = 25%\n|quote = The cry of Free Man was raised, not for the extension of liberty to the black man, but for the protection of the liberty of the white.\n|source = \u2014[[Frederick Douglass]]\n}}\n\nThe politicians of the 1850s were acting in a society in which the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional conflict in the 1820s and 1850s\u2014the most important of which being the stability of the two-party system\u2014were being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and a time in which politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics was, in one of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nHistorian Allan Nevins, for instance, writes of political rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women. Voter turnouts even ran as high as 84% by 1860. An abundance of new parties emerged 1854\u201356, including the Republicans, People's party men, Anti-Nebraskans, Fusionists, [[Know Nothing]]s, Know-Somethings (anti-slavery nativists), Maine Lawites, Temperance men, Rum Democrats, Silver Gray Whigs, Hindus, Hard Shell Democrats, Soft Shells, Half Shells and Adopted Citizens. By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided four ways. Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the Constitutional Union party in 1860.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nMany Southern states held constitutional conventions in 1851 to consider the questions of nullification and secession. With the exception of South Carolina, whose convention election did not even offer the option of \"no secession\" but rather \"no secession without the collaboration of other states\", the Southern conventions were dominated by Unionists who voted down articles of secession.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n===Economics===\nHistorians today generally agree that economic conflicts were not a major cause of the war. While an economic basis to the sectional crisis was popular among the \"Progressive school\" of historians from the 1910s to the 1940s, few professional historians now subscribe to this explanation.<ref>McPherson (2007) pp.4\u20137. James M. McPherson wrote in referring to the Progressive historians, the Vanderbilt agrarians, and revisionists writing in the 1940s, \"While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few historians now subscribe to them.\"</ref> According to economic historian Lee A. Craig, \"In fact, numerous studies by economic historians over the past several decades reveal that economic conflict was not an inherent condition of North-South relations during the antebellum era and did not cause the Civil War.\"<ref>Craig in Woodworth, ed. ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996), p.505.</ref>\n\nWhen numerous groups tried at the last minute in 1860\u201361 to find a compromise to avert war, they did not turn to economic policies. The three major attempts at compromise, the [[Crittenden Compromise]], the [[Corwin Amendment]] and the Washington Peace Conference, addressed only the slavery-related issues of fugitive slave laws, personal liberty laws, slavery in the territories and interference with slavery within the existing slave states.<ref>Donald 2001 pp 134\u201338</ref>\n\n====Economic value of slavery to the South====\nHistorian James L. Huston emphasizes the role of slavery as an economic institution. In October 1860 [[William Lowndes Yancey]], a leading advocate of secession, placed the value of Southern-held slaves at $2.8 billion.<ref>Huston pp. 24\u201325. Huston lists other estimates of the value of slaves; James D. B. De Bow puts it at $2 billion in 1850, while in 1858 Governor James Pettus of Mississippi estimated the value at $2.6 billion in 1858.</ref> Huston writes:\n\n{{quote|Understanding the relations between wealth, slavery, and property rights in the South provides a powerful means of understanding southern political behavior leading to disunion. First, the size dimensions of slavery are important to comprehend, for slavery was a colossal institution. Second, the property rights argument was the ultimate defense of slavery, and white southerners and the proslavery radicals knew it. Third, the weak point in the protection of slavery by property rights was the federal government. ... Fourth, the intense need to preserve the sanctity of property rights in Africans led southern political leaders to demand the nationalization of slavery\u2013 the condition under which slaveholders would always be protected in their property holdings.<ref>Huston, \"''Calculating the Value of the Union''\", p. 25</ref>}}\n\nThe [[cotton gin]] greatly increased the efficiency with which cotton could be harvested, contributing to the consolidation of \"[[King Cotton]]\" as the backbone of the economy of the Deep South, and to the entrenchment of the system of slave labor on which the cotton plantation economy depended.  Any chance that the South would industrialize was over.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThe tendency of [[monoculture]] cotton plantings to lead to soil exhaustion created a need for cotton planters to move their operations to new lands, and therefore to the westward expansion of slavery from the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] into new areas (e.g., Alabama, Mississippi, and beyond to [[East Texas]]).<ref>[http://www.sc.edu/uscpress/2007/3681.html Soil Exhaustion as a Factor in the Agricultural History of Virginia and Maryland, 1606\u20131860<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/Co-Da/Cotton.html Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy \u2013 A-D<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====Regional economic differences====\n[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|right|thumb|400px|An animation showing the free/slave status of U.S. states and territories, 1789\u20131861]]\n\nThe South, Midwest, and Northeast had quite different economic structures. They traded with each other and each became more prosperous by staying in the Union, a point many businessmen made in 1860\u201361. However, [[Charles A. Beard]] in the 1920s made a highly influential argument to the effect that these differences caused the war (rather than slavery or constitutional debates). He saw the industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the agrarian Midwest against the plantation South. Critics challenged his image of a unified Northeast and said that the region was in fact highly diverse with many different competing economic interests. In 1860\u201361, most business interests in the Northeast opposed war.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nAfter 1950, only a few mainstream historians accepted the Beard interpretation, though it was accepted by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economists.<ref>Woodworth, ed.

Stampp, ''The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War'' (1981) p 198</ref> \"Most historians ... now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united.\"<ref>Also from Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Imperiled Union'', p 198:<blockquote>Most historians ... now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united. Beard oversimplified the controversies relating to federal economic policy, for neither section unanimously supported or opposed measures such as the protective tariff, appropriations for internal improvements, or the creation of a national banking system. ... During the 1850s, Federal economic policy gave no substantial cause for southern disaffection, for policy was largely determined by pro-Southern Congresses and administrations. Finally, the characteristic posture of the conservative northeastern business community was far from anti-Southern. Most merchants, bankers, and manufacturers were outspoken in their hostility to antislavery agitation and eager for sectional compromise in order to maintain their profitable business connections with the South. The conclusion seems inescapable that if economic differences, real though they were, had been all that troubled relations between North and South, there would be no substantial basis for the idea of an irrepressible conflict.</blockquote></ref>\n\n====Free labor vs. pro-slavery arguments====\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] argued that a free-labor ideology dominated thinking in the North, which emphasized economic opportunity. By contrast, Southerners described free labor as \"greasy mechanics, filthy operators, small-fisted farmers, and moonstruck theorists\".<ref>[[James M.

Without centralized church authorities, American Protestantism was heavily reliant on the Bible, which was read in the standard 19th-century Reformed [[hermeneutic]] of \"common sense\", literal interpretation as if the Bible were speaking directly about the modern American situation instead of events that occurred in a much different context, millennia ago.<ref name=\"Noll, 2002\" /> By the mid-19th century this form of religion and Bible interpretation had become a dominant strand in American religious, moral and political discourse, almost serving as a de facto state religion.<ref name=\"Noll, 2002\" />\n\nThe Bible, interpreted under these assumptions, seemed to clearly suggest that slavery was Biblically justified:<ref name=\"Noll, 2002\" />\n\n<blockquote>\"The pro-slavery South could point to slaveholding by the godly patriarch [[Abraham]] (Gen 12:5; 14:14; 24:35\u201336; 26:13\u201314), a practice that was later incorporated into Israelite national law (Lev 25:44\u201346). It was never denounced by [[Jesus]], who made slavery a model of discipleship (Mk 10:44). The [[Apostle Paul]] supported slavery, counseling obedience to earthly masters (Eph 6:5\u20139; Col 3:22\u201325) as a duty in agreement with \"the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness\" (1 Tim 6:3). Because slaves were to remain in their present state unless they could win their freedom (1 Cor 7:20\u201324), he sent the fugitive slave [[Onesimus]] back to his owner [[Saint Philemon|Philemon]] (Phlm 10\u201320). The abolitionist north had a difficult time matching the pro-slavery south passage for passage. ... Professor Eugene Genovese, who has studied these biblical debates over slavery in minute detail, concludes that the pro-slavery faction clearly emerged victorious over the abolitionists except for one specious argument based on the so-called [[Curse of Ham]] (Gen 9:18\u201327). For our purposes, it is important to realize that the South won this crucial contest with the North by using the prevailing hermeneutic, or method of interpretation, on which both sides agreed. So decisive was its triumph that the South mounted a vigorous counterattack on the abolitionists as infidels who had abandoned the plain words of Scripture for the secular ideology of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\"<ref name=\"Hull, 2003\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/043/Learning%20the%20Lessons%20of%20Slavery%20By%20William%20E.%20Hull_043_05_.htm |last=Hull |first=William E. |title=Learning the Lessons of Slavery |date=February 2003 |journal=Christian Ethics Today |volume=9 |issue=43 |accessdate=2007-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211214614/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/043/Learning%20the%20Lessons%20of%20Slavery%20By%20William%20E.%20Hull_043_05_.htm |archive-date=2007-12-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nProtestant churches in the U.S., unable to agree on what God's Word said about slavery, ended up with schisms between Northern and Southern branches: the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1844, the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] in 1845,<ref>Walter B.

Many of the reformers of the period, including abolitionists, attempted in one way or another to transform the lifestyle and work habits of labor, helping workers respond to the new demands of an [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]], capitalistic society.\n\nAntislavery, like many other reform movements of the period, was influenced by the legacy of the [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival in the new country stressing the reform of individuals, which was still relatively fresh in the American memory. Thus, while the reform spirit of the period was expressed by a variety of movements with often-conflicting political goals, most reform movements shared a common feature in their emphasis on the Great Awakening principle of transforming the human personality through discipline, order, and restraint.\n\n\"Abolitionist\" had several meanings at the time. The followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], including [[Wendell Phillips]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], demanded the \"immediate abolition of slavery\", hence the name. A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, like [[Theodore Weld]] and [[Arthur Tappan]], wanted immediate action, but that action might well be a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage. \"Antislavery men\", like [[John Quincy Adams]], did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841 Adams represented the [[United States v. The Amistad|Amistad]] African slaves in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and argued that they should be set free.<ref name=\"AmistadCase\">{{cite web|title=The Amistad Case |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |url=http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106090007/http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm |archivedate=November 6, 2007 }}</ref> In the last years before the war, \"antislavery\" could mean the Northern majority, like [[Abraham Lincoln]], who opposed ''expansion'' of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, or the [[Fugitive slave laws|Fugitive Slave Act]]. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians. [[James M. McPherson]] explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: \"All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution.\"<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'' p. 8; James Brewer Stewart, ''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' (1976); Pressly, 270ff</ref>\n\n[[File:Slavepatrols.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A woodcut from the abolitionist ''Anti-Slavery Almanac'' (1839) depicts the capture of a fugitive slave by a [[slave patrol]].]]\n\nStressing the [[Yankee]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] ideals of self-improvement, industry, and thrift, most abolitionists\u2014most notably William Lloyd Garrison\u2014condemned slavery as a lack of control over one's own destiny and the fruits of one's labor.\n\n[[Wendell Phillips]], one of the most ardent abolitionists, attacked the [[Slave Power]] and presaged disunion as early as 1845:\n\n<blockquote> The experience of the fifty years ... shows us the slaves trebling in numbers\u2014slaveholders monopolizing the offices and dictating the policy of the Government\u2014prostituting the strength and influence of the Nation to the support of slavery here and elsewhere\u2014trampling on the rights of the free States, and making the courts of the country their tools. To continue this disastrous alliance longer is madness. ... Why prolong the experiment?<ref>Wendell Phillips, \"No Union With Slaveholders\", January 15, 1845, in Louis Ruchames, ed. ''The Abolitionists'' (1963), p.196.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbolitionists also attacked slavery as a threat to the freedom of white Americans. Defining freedom as more than a simple lack of restraint, antebellum reformers held that the truly free man was one who imposed restraints upon himself. Thus, for the anti-slavery reformers of the 1830s and 1840s, the promise of free labor and upward social mobility (opportunities for advancement, rights to own property, and to control one's own labor), was central to the ideal of reforming individuals.\n\nControversy over the so-called [[Ostend Manifesto]] (which proposed the U.S. annexation of [[Cuba]] as a slave state) and the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]] kept sectional tensions alive before the issue of slavery in the West could occupy the country's politics in the mid-to-late 1850s.\n\nAntislavery sentiment among some groups in the North intensified after the [[Compromise of 1850]], when Southerners began appearing in Northern states to pursue fugitives or often to claim as slaves free African Americans who had resided there for years. Meanwhile, some abolitionists openly sought to prevent enforcement of the law. Violation of the Fugitive Slave Act was often open and organized. In [[Boston]]\u2014a city from which it was boasted that no fugitive had ever been returned\u2014[[Theodore Parker]] and other members of the city's elite helped form mobs to prevent enforcement of the law as early as April 1851. A pattern of public resistance emerged in city after city, notably in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] in 1851 (culminating in the [[Jerry Rescue]] incident late that year), and Boston again in 1854. But the issue did not lead to a crisis until revived by the same issue underlying the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820]]: slavery in the territories.\n\n===Arguments for and against slavery===\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, a prominent abolitionist, was motivated by a belief in the growth of democracy. Because the Constitution had a [[three-fifths clause]], a [[fugitive slave clause]], and a [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|20-year protection of the Atlantic slave trade]], Garrison publicly burned a copy of the [[U.S. Constitution]], and called it \"a covenant with death and an agreement with hell\".<ref>Mason I Lowance, ''Against Slavery: An Abolitionist Reader'', (2000), page 26</ref>\nIn 1854, he said:\n\n{{quote|I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, \"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Hence, I am an abolitionist.

In 1848 Radical New York Democrats known as [[Barnburners]], members of the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], and anti-slavery Whigs formed the Free-Soil Party. The party supported former President [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[Charles Francis Adams Sr.]] for President and Vice President. The party opposed the expansion of slavery into territories where it had not yet existed, such as [[Oregon]] and the ceded Mexican territory. It had the effect of dividing the Democratic Party in the North, especially in areas of Yankee settlement<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref>\n\n[[Eric Foner]] in ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970) emphasized the importance of free labor ideology to Northern opponents of slavery, pointing out that the moral concerns of the abolitionists were not necessarily the dominant sentiments in the North. Many Northerners (including Lincoln) opposed slavery also because they feared that rich slave owners would buy up the best lands and block opportunity for free white farmers using family and hired labor. Free Soilers joined the Republican party in 1854, with their appeal to powerful demands in the North through a broader commitment to \"[[free labor]]\" principles. Fear of the \"[[Slave Power]]\" had a far greater appeal to Northern self-interest than did abolitionist arguments based on the plight of black slaves in the South.<ref name=\"Leonard L. Richards 2000\"/>\n\n==Slavery question in territories acquired from Mexico==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}} \nSoon after the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] started and long before negotiation of the new [[US-Mexico border]], the question of slavery in the territories to be acquired polarized the Northern and [[Southern United States]] in the most bitter sectional conflict up to this time, which lasted for a deadlock of four years during which the [[Second Party System]] broke up, [[Mormon pioneers]] settled [[Utah]], the [[California Gold Rush]] settled [[California]], and New Mexico under a federal military government turned back [[Texas]]'s attempt to assert control over territory Texas claimed as far west as the [[Rio Grande]]. Eventually the [[Compromise of 1850]] preserved the Union, but only for another decade. Proposals included:\n* The [[Wilmot Proviso]] banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas, which had been annexed the previous year. Passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Later an effort to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] also failed.\n* Failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then [[Stephen Douglas]] extending the [[Missouri Compromise]] line ([[36\u00b030' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific Ocean , allowing slavery in most of present-day [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], southern [[Nevada]], and [[Southern California]], as well as any other territories that might be acquired from Mexico. The line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.\n* [[Popular sovereignty]], developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Douglas as the eventual [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] position, letting each territory decide whether to allow slavery.\n* [[William L. Yancey]]'s \"Alabama Platform\", endorsed by the [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in [[Florida]] and [[Virginia]], called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories either by the federal government or by territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws.\n* General [[Zachary Taylor]], who became the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate in 1848 and then President from March 1849 to July 1850, proposed after becoming President that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico, but much larger than the eventual ones. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], avoiding the question of slavery in the territories.\n* The Mormons' proposal for a [[State of Deseret]], incorporating most of the area of the Mexican Cession but excluding the large non-Mormon populations in [[Northern California]] and central [[New Mexico]], was considered unlikely to succeed in [[United States Congress|Congress]], but nevertheless in 1849 President Zachary Taylor sent his agent [[John Thomas Wilson|John Wilson]] westward with a proposal to combine California and Deseret as a single state, decreasing the number of new [[Slave and free states|free states]] and the erosion of Southern parity in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n[[File:USA Territorial Growth 1850.jpg|thumb|right|500px]]\n* The [[Compromise of 1850]], proposed by [[Henry Clay]] in January 1850, guided to passage by Douglas over Northern Whig and Southern Democrat opposition, and enacted September 1850, admitted California as a free state, including [[Southern California]], and organized [[Utah Territory]] and [[New Mexico Territory]] with slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty. Texas dropped its claim to the disputed northwestern areas in return for debt relief, and the areas were divided between the two new territories and [[unorganized territory]]. [[El Paso]], where Texas had successfully established county government, was left in Texas. No territory dominated by Southerners (like the later short-lived [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]]) was created. Also, the [[slave trade]] was abolished in [[Washington, D.C.]] (but not slavery itself), and the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was strengthened.\n\n==States' rights==\n{{Main|States' rights}}\n\nStates' rights was an issue in the 19th century for those who felt that the federal government was superseded by the authority of the individual states and was in violation of the role intended for it by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. [[Kenneth M. Stampp]] notes that each section used states' rights arguments when convenient, and shifted positions when convenient.<ref>Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', page 59</ref> For example, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was enacted by southern representatives to use federal authority to suppress northern states' rights. The constitution gave federal protection to slave property rights, and slaveholders demanded that this federal power should be strengthened and take precedence over northern state laws. Anti-slavery forces in northern legislatures had resisted this constitutional right in the form of state personal liberty laws that placed state laws above the federal mandate.\n\n===States' rights and slavery===\n[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] noted that the states' rights \"never had any real vitality independent of underlying conditions of vast social, economic, or political significance.\"<ref>Schlesinger quotes from an essay \"The State Rights Fetish\" excerpted in Stampp p. 70</ref> He further elaborated:\n\n{{quote|From the close of the nullification episode of 1832\u20131833 to the outbreak of the Civil War, the agitation of state rights was intimately connected with a new issue of growing importance, the slavery question, and the principal form assumed by the doctrine was that of the right of secession. The pro-slavery forces sought refuge in the state rights position as a shield against federal interference with pro-slavery projects. ... As a natural consequence, anti-slavery legislatures in the North were led to lay great stress on the national character of the Union and the broad powers of the general government in dealing with slavery. Nevertheless, it is significant to note that when it served anti-slavery purposes better to lapse into state rights dialectic, northern legislatures did not hesitate to be inconsistent.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yTyuTDhmsIwC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false Schlesinger in Stampp pp. 68\u201369]</ref>}}\n\nEchoing Schlesinger, [[Forrest McDonald]] wrote that \"the dynamics of the tension between federal and state authority changed abruptly during the late 1840s\" as a result of the acquisition of territory in the Mexican War. McDonald states:\n\n{{quote|And then, as a by-product or offshoot of a war of conquest, slavery\u2013 a subject that leading politicians had, with the exception of the gag rule controversy and Calhoun's occasional outbursts, scrupulously kept out of partisan debate\u2013 erupted as the dominant issue in that arena.

Benning]] stated the reasoning behind Georgia's declaring secession from the Union:\n\n{{quote|What was the reason that induced ... secession? This reason may be summed up in one single proposition.

Acting as a \"conscious minority\", Southerners hoped that a strict, constructionist interpretation of the Constitution would limit federal power over the states, and that a defense of states' rights against federal encroachments or even nullification or secession would save the South.<ref>Kenneth M. Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', p. 14</ref> Before 1860, most presidents were either Southern or pro-South. The North's growing population would mean the election of pro-North presidents, and the addition of free-soil states would end Southern parity with the North in the Senate. As the historian [[Allan Nevins]] described Calhoun's theory of states' rights, \"Governments, observed Calhoun, were formed to protect minorities, for majorities could take care of themselves.\"<ref>Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny 1847\u20131852'', p. 155</ref>\n\nUntil the 1860 election, the South's interests nationally were entrusted to the Democratic Party. In 1860, the Democratic Party split into Northern and Southern factions as the result of a \"bitter debate in the Senate between Jefferson Davis and Stephen Douglas\". The debate was over resolutions proposed by Davis \"opposing popular sovereignty and supporting a federal slave code and states' rights\" which carried over to the national convention in Charleston.<ref>Donald, Baker, and Holt, p.117.</ref>\n\nJefferson Davis defined equality in terms of the equal rights of states,<ref>When arguing for the equality of states, he said, \"Who has been in advance of him in the fiery charge on the rights of the States, and in assuming to the Federal Government the power to crush and to coerce them? Even to-day he has repeated his doctrines.

Keitt]] of South Carolina said, \"The [[Republican Party (United States)|anti-slavery party]] contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States.\"<ref>Lawrence Keitt, Congressman from South Carolina, in a speech to the House on January 25, 1860: ''Congressional Globe''.</ref>\n\nStampp mentioned Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]]' ''A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States'' as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \"[[Cornerstone Speech|cornerstone of the Confederacy]]\" when the war began and then later switched course in saying that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after the Confederacy's defeat. Stampp said that Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]].<ref>Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nHistorian [[William C. Davis (historian)|William C. Davis]] also mentioned inconsistencies in Southern states' rights arguments. He explained the [[Confederate States Constitution|Confederate Constitution]]'s protection of slavery at the national level as follows:\n\n{{quote|To the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William C.|last=Davis|title=Look Away!: A History of the Confederate States of America|date=2002|pages=97\u201398}}</ref>}}\n\nW.C. Davis also stated that:\n\n{{quote|In fact, the state rights defense of secession in 1860\u20131861 did not really appear in force until after 1865 as builders of the Lost Cause myth sought to distance themselves from slavery.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William C.|last=Davis|title=The Cause Lost: Myths and Realities of the Confederacy|date=1996|location=Kansas|publisher=University Press of Kansas|page=180}}</ref>}}\n\nSouthern historian Gordon Rhea wrote in 2011 that:\n\n{{quote|Tariffs appear nowhere in ... sermons and speeches, and 'states' rights' are mentioned only in the context of the rights of states to ... own other humans. The central message was to play on the fear of African barbarians ... The preachers and politicians delivered on their promise. The Confederate States were established explicitly to preserve and expand the institution of slavery. [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]], the Confederacy's vice president, [[Cornerstone Speech|said so himself in 1861]], in unambiguous terms.<ref name=GordonRhea />}}\n\n==The Compromise of 1850==\n{{Main|Compromise of 1850}}\nThe victory of the United States over Mexico resulted in the addition of large new territories conquered from Mexico. Controversy over whether these territories would be slave or free raised the risk of a war between slave and free states, and Northern support for the [[Wilmot Proviso]], which would have banned slavery in the conquered territories, increased sectional tensions. The controversy was temporarily resolved by the [[Compromise of 1850]], which allowed the territories of [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] to decide for or against slavery, but also allowed the admission of [[California]] as a free state, reduced the size of the slave state of [[Texas]] by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the [[District of Columbia]]. In return, the South got a stronger [[fugitive slave law]] than the version mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. The Fugitive Slave Law would reignite controversy over slavery.\n\n===Fugitive Slave Law issues===\nThe [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] required that Northerners assist Southerners in reclaiming fugitive slaves, which many Northerners found to be extremely offensive. [[Anthony Burns]] was among the fugitive slaves captured and returned in chains to slavery as a result of the law. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s best selling novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' greatly increased opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law.\n\n==Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act (1854)==\n{{Main|Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act}}\nMost people thought the Compromise had ended the territorial issue, but [[Stephen A. Douglas]] reopened it in 1854, in the name of democracy. Douglas proposed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Bill with the intention of opening up vast new high-quality farm lands to settlement. As a [[Chicago]]an, he was especially interested in the railroad connections from Chicago into Kansas and Nebraska, but that was not a controversial point. More importantly, Douglas firmly believed in democracy at the grass roots\u2014that actual settlers have the right to decide on slavery, not politicians from other states. His bill provided that [[popular sovereignty]], through the territorial legislatures, should decide \"all questions pertaining to slavery\", thus effectively repealing the [[Missouri Compromise]]. The ensuing public reaction against it created a firestorm of protest in the Northern states. It was seen as an effort to repeal the Missouri Compromise. However, the popular reaction in the first month after the bill's introduction failed to foreshadow the gravity of the situation. As Northern papers initially ignored the story, Republican leaders lamented the lack of a popular response.\n\nEventually, the popular reaction did come, but the leaders had to spark it. [[Salmon P. Chase]]'s \"Appeal of the Independent Democrats\" did much to arouse popular opinion. In New York, [[William H. Seward]] finally took it upon himself to organize a rally against the Nebraska bill, since none had arisen spontaneously. Press such as the ''National Era'', the ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', and local free-soil journals, condemned the bill. The [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates of 1858]] drew national attention to the issue of slavery expansion.\n\n===Founding of the Republican Party (1854)===\n{{refimprove|Section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:CSumner.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Charles Sumner, the Senate's leading opponent of slavery]]\n{{See also|History of the United States Republican Party}}\nConvinced that Northern society was superior to that of the South, and increasingly persuaded of the South's ambitions to extend slave power beyond its existing borders, Northerners were embracing a viewpoint that made conflict likely; however, conflict required the ascendancy of a political group to express the views of the North, such as the Republican Party. The Republican Party\u2014campaigning on the popular, emotional issue of \"free soil\" in the frontier\u2014captured the [[White House]] after just six years of existence.\n\nThe Republican Party grew out of the controversy over the Kansas\u2013Nebraska legislation. Once the Northern reaction against the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act took place, its leaders acted to advance another political reorganization. [[Henry Wilson]] declared the Whig Party dead and vowed to oppose any efforts to resurrect it. [[Horace Greeley]]'s ''Tribune'' called for the formation of a new Northern party, and [[Benjamin Wade]], Chase, [[Charles Sumner]], and others spoke out for the union of all opponents of the Nebraska Act. The ''Tribune{{'}}''s [[Gamaliel Bailey]] was involved in calling a caucus of anti-slavery Whig and Democratic Party Congressmen in May.\n\nMeeting in a [[Ripon, Wisconsin]], [[Congregational church]] on February 28, 1854, some thirty opponents of the Nebraska Act called for the organization of a new political party and suggested that \"Republican\" would be the most appropriate name (to link their cause to the defunct [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]] of Thomas Jefferson). These founders also took a leading role in the creation of the Republican Party in many northern states during the summer of 1854. While conservatives and many moderates were content merely to call for the restoration of the Missouri Compromise or a prohibition of slavery extension, radicals advocated repeal of the Fugitive Slave Laws and rapid abolition in existing states. The term \"radical\" has also been applied to those who objected to the Compromise of 1850, which extended slavery in the territories.\n\nBut without the benefit of hindsight, the 1854 elections would seem to indicate the possible triumph of the [[Know-Nothing]] movement rather than anti-slavery, with the Catholic/immigrant question replacing slavery as the issue capable of mobilizing mass appeal. Know-Nothings, for instance, captured the mayoralty of [[Philadelphia]] with a majority of over 8,000 votes in 1854. Even after opening up immense discord with his Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, Senator Douglas began speaking of the Know-Nothings, rather than the Republicans, as the principal danger to the Democratic Party.\n\nWhen Republicans spoke of themselves as a party of \"[[free labor]]\", they appealed to a rapidly growing, primarily middle class base of support, not permanent wage earners or the unemployed (the working class). When they extolled the virtues of free labor, they were merely reflecting the experiences of millions of men who had \"made it\" and millions of others who had a realistic hope of doing so. Like the [[Tory|Tories]] in England, the Republicans in the United States would emerge as the [[Nationalism|nationalists]], homogenizers, [[Imperialism|imperialists]], and cosmopolitans.\n\nThose who had not yet \"made it\" included [[Irish Americans|Irish immigrants]], who made up a large growing proportion of Northern factory workers. Republicans often saw the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] working class as lacking the qualities of self-discipline, temperance, and sobriety essential for their vision of ordered liberty. Republicans insisted that there was a high correlation between education, religion, and hard work\u2014the values of the \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\"\u2014and Republican votes. \"Where free schools are regarded as a nuisance, where religion is least honored and lazy unthrift is the rule,\" read an editorial of the pro-Republican ''Chicago Democratic Press'' after [[James Buchanan]]'s defeat of [[John C. Fremont]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|1856 presidential election]], \"there Buchanan has received his strongest support.\"\n\nEthno-religious, socio-economic, and cultural fault lines ran throughout American society, but were becoming increasingly sectional, pitting Yankee Protestants with a stake in the emerging industrial capitalism and American nationalism increasingly against those tied to Southern slaveholding interests. For example, acclaimed historian [[Don E. Fehrenbacher]], in his ''Prelude to Greatness, Lincoln in the 1850s'', noticed how [[Illinois]] was a microcosm of the national political scene, pointing out voting patterns that bore striking correlations to regional patterns of settlement. Those areas settled from the South were staunchly Democratic, while those by [[New England]]ers were staunchly Republican. A belt of border counties were known for their political moderation, and traditionally held the balance of power. Intertwined with religious, ethnic, regional, and class identities, the issues of free labor and free soil were thus easy to play on.\n\nEvents during the next two years in \"Bleeding Kansas\" sustained the popular fervor originally aroused among some elements in the North by the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] settlers from the North were encouraged by press and pulpit and the powerful organs of abolitionist propaganda. Often they received financial help from such organizations as the [[Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company]]. Those from the South often received financial contributions from the communities they left. Southerners sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse \"hostile and ruinous legislation\".\n\nWhile the Great Plains were largely unfit for the cultivation of [[cotton]], informed Southerners demanded that the West be open to slavery, often\u2014perhaps most often\u2014with minerals in mind. [[Brazil]], for instance, was an example of the successful use of slave labor in mining. In the middle of the 18th century, [[diamond]] mining supplemented [[gold]] mining in [[Minas Gerais]] and accounted for a massive transfer of masters and slaves from Brazil's northeastern sugar region. Southern leaders knew a good deal about this experience. It was even promoted in the pro-slavery ''[[De Bow's Review]]'' as far back as 1848.\n\n==Fragmentation of the American party system==\n\n===\"Bleeding Kansas\" and the elections of 1856===\n[[File:Augustus Washington - John Brown - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]]]\n{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1856|Bleeding Kansas}}\n\nIn Kansas around 1855, the slavery issue reached a condition of intolerable tension and violence. But this was in an area where an overwhelming proportion of settlers were merely land-hungry Westerners indifferent to the public issues. The majority of the inhabitants were not concerned with sectional tensions or the issue of slavery. Instead, the tension in Kansas began as a contention between rival claimants. During the first wave of settlement, no one held titles to the land, and settlers rushed to occupy newly open land fit for [[Tillage|cultivation]]. While the tension and violence did emerge as a pattern pitting [[Yankee]] and Missourian settlers against each other, there is little evidence of any ideological divides on the questions of slavery. Instead, the Missouri claimants, thinking of Kansas as their own domain, regarded the Yankee [[squatting|squatters]] as invaders, while the Yankees accused the Missourians of grabbing the best land without honestly settling on it.\n\nHowever, the 1855\u201356 violence in \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" did reach an ideological climax after [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\u2014regarded by followers as the instrument of God's will to destroy slavery\u2014entered the melee. His assassination of five pro-slavery settlers (the so-called \"[[Pottawatomie massacre]]\", during the night of May 24, 1856) resulted in some irregular, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla-style]] strife. Aside from John Brown's fervor, the strife in Kansas often involved only armed bands more interested in land claims or loot.\n\n{{quote box\n|align = left\n|width = 35%\n|quote = His zeal in the cause of freedom was infinitely superior to mine ... Mine was as the taper light; his was as the burning sun. I could live for the slave; John Brown could die for him.\n|source = \u2014[[Frederick Douglass]] speaking of John Brown\n}}\n\nOf greater importance than the civil strife in Kansas, however, was the reaction against it nationwide and in Congress. In both North and South, the belief was widespread that the aggressive designs of the other section were epitomized by (and responsible for) what was happening in Kansas. Consequently, \"Bleeding Kansas\" emerged as a symbol of sectional controversy.\n\nIndignant over the developments in Kansas, the Republicans\u2014the first entirely [[sectionalism|sectional]] major party in U.S. history\u2014entered their first presidential campaign with confidence. Their nominee, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], was a generally safe candidate for the new party.<ref>[[Carl Sandburg]] (1954), ''Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years'', reprint, New York: Dell, Volume 1 of 3, Chapter 10, \"The Deepening Slavery Issue\", p. [221].</ref> Although his nomination upset some of their [[Know Nothing|Nativist Know-Nothing]] supporters (his mother was a Catholic), the nomination of the famed explorer of the Far West and ex-senator from California with a short political record was an attempt to woo ex-Democrats. The other two Republican contenders, [[William H. Seward]] and [[Salmon P. Chase]], were seen as too radical.\n\nNevertheless, the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|campaign of 1856]] was waged almost exclusively on the slavery issue\u2014pitted as a struggle between democracy and aristocracy\u2014focusing on the question of Kansas. The Republicans condemned the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and the expansion of slavery, but they advanced a program of [[public works|internal improvements]] combining the idealism of anti-slavery with the economic aspirations of the North. The new party rapidly developed a powerful partisan culture, and energetic activists drove voters to the polls in unprecedented numbers. People reacted with fervor. Young Republicans organized the \"Wide Awake\" clubs and chanted \"Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men, Fr\u00e9mont!\" With Southern [[Fire-Eaters]] and even some moderates uttering threats of secession if Fr\u00e9mont won, the Democratic candidate, [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], benefited from apprehensions about the future of the Union.\n\n[[Millard Fillmore]], the candidate of the American Party (Know-Nothings) and the Silver Gray Whigs, said in a speech at [[Albany, New York]], that the election of a Republican candidate would [[Secession in the United States|dissolve the Union]]. Abraham Lincoln replied on July 23 in a speech at [[Galena, Illinois]]; [[Carl Sandburg]] wrote that this speech probably resembled [[Lincoln's Lost Speech]]: \"This Government would be very weak, indeed, if a majority, with a disciplined army and navy, and a well-filled treasury, could not preserve itself, when attacked by an unarmed, undisciplined, unorganized minority. All this talk about the dissolution of the Union is humbug\u2014nothing but folly. ''We won't'' dissolve the Union, and ''you shan't''.\"<ref>The speech was reported by newspapers in Galena and Springfield, IL.

Sandford\", ''The American Journal of Legal History'', 32 (4): 373\u2013390.</ref> were both part of the [[Bleeding Kansas]] controversy over slavery as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which was [[Stephen Douglas]]' attempt at replacing the [[Missouri Compromise]] ban on slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories with popular sovereignty, which meant that the people of a territory could vote either for or against slavery. The Lecompton Constitution, which would have allowed slavery in Kansas, was the result of massive vote fraud by the pro-slavery [[Border Ruffian]]s. Douglas defeated the Lecompton Constitution because it was supported by the minority of pro-slavery people in Kansas, and Douglas believed in majority rule. Douglas hoped that both South and North would support popular sovereignty, but the opposite was true. Neither side trusted Douglas.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Supreme Court decision of 1857 in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' added to the controversy. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney]]'s decision said that blacks were \"so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,\"<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis'', page 275.</ref> and that slavery could spread into the territories even if the majority of people in the territories were anti-slavery. Lincoln warned that \"the next ''Dred Scott'' decision\"<ref>First Lincoln Douglas Debate at Ottawa, Illinois August 21, 1858</ref> could impose slavery on Northern states.<ref>Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''[[The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics]]'' (178) pp. 445\u201346.</ref>\n\n===Buchanan, Republicans and anti-administration Democrats===\n[[File:Buchanan-thumbnail.jpg|left|frame|President James Buchanan]]\n{{See also|Lecompton constitution|Stephen A. Douglas|James Buchanan}}\nPresident [[James Buchanan]] decided to end the troubles in Kansas by urging Congress to admit Kansas as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. Kansas voters, however, soundly rejected this constitution\u2014at least with a measure of widespread fraud on both sides\u2014by more than 10,000 votes. As Buchanan directed his presidential authority to this goal, he further angered the Republicans and alienated members of his own party. Prompting their break with the administration, the Douglasites saw this scheme as an attempt to pervert the principle of popular sovereignty on which the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was based. Nationwide, conservatives were incensed, feeling as though the principles of [[states' rights]] had been violated. Even in the South, ex-Whigs and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] Know-Nothings\u2014most notably [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] and [[John J. Crittenden]] (key figures in the event of sectional controversies)\u2014urged the Republicans to oppose the administration's moves and take up the demand that the territories be given the power to accept or reject sovereignty.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the schism in the Democratic party deepened, moderate Republicans argued that an alliance with anti-administration Democrats, especially Stephen Douglas, would be a key advantage in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 elections]]. Some Republican observers saw the controversy over the Lecompton Constitution as an opportunity to peel off Democratic support in the border states, where Fr\u00e9mont picked up little support. After all, the border states had often gone for Whigs with a Northern base of support in the past without prompting threats of Southern withdrawal from the Union.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAmong the proponents of this strategy was ''[[The New York Times]]'', which called on the Republicans to downplay opposition to popular sovereignty in favor of a compromise policy calling for \"no more slave states\" in order to quell sectional tensions. The ''Times'' maintained that for the Republicans to be competitive in the 1860 elections, they would need to broaden their base of support to include all voters who for one reason or another were upset with the Buchanan Administration.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIndeed, pressure was strong for an alliance that would unite the growing opposition to the Democratic Administration. But such an alliance was no novel idea; it would essentially entail transforming the Republicans into the national, conservative, Union party of the country. In effect, this would be a successor to the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRepublican leaders, however, staunchly opposed any attempts to modify the party position on slavery, appalled by what they considered a surrender of their principles when, for example, all the ninety-two Republican members of Congress voted for the [[Crittenden-Montgomery bill]] in 1858. Although this compromise measure blocked Kansas' entry into the union as a slave state, the fact that it called for popular sovereignty, rather than outright opposition to the expansion of slavery, was troubling to the party leaders.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn the end, the Crittenden-Montgomery bill did not forge a grand anti-administration coalition of Republicans, ex-Whig Southerners in the border states, and Northern Democrats. Instead, the Democratic Party merely split along sectional lines. Anti-Lecompton Democrats complained that a new, pro-slavery test had been imposed upon the party. The Douglasites, however, refused to yield to administration pressure. Like the anti-Nebraska Democrats, who were now members of the Republican Party, the Douglasites insisted that they\u2014not the administration\u2014commanded the support of most northern Democrats.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nExtremist sentiment in the South advanced dramatically as the Southern planter class perceived its hold on the executive, legislative, and judicial apparatus of the central government wane. It also grew increasingly difficult for Southern Democrats to manipulate power in many of the Northern states through their allies in the Democratic Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Honor===\nHistorians have emphasized that the sense of [[honor]] was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners.<ref>Bertram Wyatt-Brown, ''Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South'' (1982) pp 22\u201323, 363</ref> The idea of being treated like a second-class citizen was anathema and could not be tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism.

Seward]], Secretary of State under Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson]]\n\nDespite their significant loss in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|election of 1856]], Republican leaders realized that even though they appealed only to Northern voters, they need win only two more states, such as [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Illinois]], to win the presidency in 1860.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the Democrats were grappling with their own troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused on the issue of slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it might be necessary to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe controversy over slavery in the West was still not creating a fixation on the issue of slavery. Although the old restraints on the sectional tensions were being eroded with the rapid extension of [[mass politics]] and mass democracy in the North, the perpetuation of conflict over the issue of slavery in the West still required the efforts of radical Democrats in the South and radical Republicans in the North. They had to ensure that the sectional conflict would remain at the center of the political debate.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[William H. Seward|William Seward]] contemplated this potential in the 1840s, when the Democrats were the nation's majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country's institutional structure and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation's territories and to garner a great deal of influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals of American democracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRepublicans believed in the existence of \"the Slave Power Conspiracy\", which had seized control of the federal government and was attempting to pervert the Constitution for its own purposes. The \"Slave Power\" idea gave the Republicans the anti-aristocratic appeal with which men like Seward had long wished to be associated politically. By fusing older anti-slavery arguments with the idea that slavery posed a threat to Northern free labor and democratic values, it enabled the Republicans to tap into the egalitarian outlook which lay at the heart of Northern society.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn this sense, during the 1860 presidential campaign, Republican orators even cast \"Honest Abe\" as an embodiment of these principles, repeatedly referring to him as \"the child of labor\" and \"son of the frontier\", who had proved how \"honest industry and toil\" were rewarded in the North. Although Lincoln had been a Whig, the \"[[Wide Awakes]]\" (members of the Republican clubs) used replicas of rails that he had split to remind voters of his humble origins.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nIn almost every northern state, organizers attempted to have a Republican Party or an anti-Nebraska fusion movement on ballots in 1854. <!-- The groundswell of popular clamor fed by the issue of free soil, however, was powerful enough to thwart these aims. Conservatives were not able to ensure the nomination of a candidate regarded as moderate enough in the South so as to not inspire the secession of Southern states in 1860. parag is about 1854, no? --> In areas where the radical Republicans controlled the new organization, the comprehensive radical program became the party policy. Just as they helped organize the Republican Party in the summer of 1854, the radicals played an important role in the national organization of the party in 1856. Republican conventions in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Illinois]] adopted radical platforms. These radical platforms in such states as [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]] usually called for the divorce of the government from slavery, the repeal of the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]], and no more slave states, as did platforms in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Minnesota]], and Massachusetts when radical influence was high.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nConservatives at the Republican 1860 [[U.S. presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]] in [[Chicago]] were able to block the nomination of [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], who had an earlier reputation as a radical (but by 1860 had been criticized by [[Horace Greeley]] as being too moderate). Other candidates had earlier joined or formed parties opposing the Whigs and had thereby made enemies of many delegates. Lincoln was selected on the third ballot. However, conservatives were unable to bring about the resurrection of \"Whiggery\". The convention's resolutions regarding slavery were roughly the same as they had been in 1856, but the language appeared less radical. In the following months, even Republican conservatives like [[Thomas Ewing]] and [[Edward Dickinson Baker|Edward Baker]] embraced the platform language that \"the normal condition of territories was freedom\". All in all, the organizers had done an effective job of shaping the official policy of the Republican Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSouthern slaveholding interests now faced the prospects of a Republican president and the entry of new free states that would alter the nation's balance of power between the sections. To many Southerners, the resounding defeat of the Lecompton Constitution foreshadowed the entry of more free states into the Union. Dating back to the Missouri Compromise, the Southern region desperately sought to maintain an equal balance of slave states and free states so as to be competitive in the Senate. Since the last slave state was admitted in 1845, five more free states had entered. The tradition of maintaining a balance between North and South was abandoned in favor of the addition of more free soil states.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Sectional battles over federal policy in the late 1850s===\n\n====Lincoln\u2013Douglas Debates====\n{{Main|Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates of 1858}}\nThe Lincoln-Douglas Debates were a series of seven debates in 1858 between [[Stephen Douglas]], United States senator from Illinois, and [[Abraham Lincoln]], the Republican who sought to replace Douglas in the Senate. The debates were mainly about slavery. Douglas defended his [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which replaced the [[Missouri Compromise]] ban on slavery in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] territory north and west of [[Missouri]] with [[popular sovereignty]], which allowed residents of territories such as the [[Territory of Kansas|Kansas]] to vote either for or against slavery. Douglas put Lincoln on the defensive by accusing him of being a Black Republican abolitionist, but Lincoln responded by asking Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the [[Dred Scott decision]]. Douglas' [[Freeport Doctrine]] was that residents of a territory could keep slavery out by refusing to pass a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. Douglas' Freeport Doctrine, and the fact that he helped defeat the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]], made Douglas unpopular in the South, which led to the 1860 split of the Democratic Party into Northern and Southern wings. The Democrats retained control of the Illinois legislature, and Douglas thus retained his seat in the U.S. Senate (at that time senators were elected by the state legislatures, not by popular vote); however, Lincoln's national profile was greatly raised, paving the way for his election as president of the United States two years later.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Background====\nIn ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), [[Charles A. Beard|Charles and Mary Beard]] argue that slavery was not so much a social or cultural institution as an economic one (a labor system). The Beards cited inherent conflicts between Northeastern finance, manufacturing, and commerce and Southern plantations, which competed to control the federal government so as to protect their own interests. According to the economic determinists of the era, both groups used arguments over slavery and states' rights as a cover.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRecent historians have rejected the Beardian thesis. But their economic determinism has influenced subsequent historians in important ways. ''[[Time on the Cross]]: The Economics of American Negro Slavery'' (1974) by [[Robert William Fogel]] (who would win the 1993 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]) and [[Stanley L. Engerman]], wrote that slavery was profitable and that the price of slaves would have continued to rise. Modernization theorists, such as [[Raimondo Luraghi]], have argued that as the [[Industrial Revolution]] was expanding on a worldwide scale, the days of wrath were coming for a series of agrarian, pre-capitalistic, \"backward\" societies throughout the world, from the Italian and American South to India. But most American historians point out the South was highly developed and on average about as prosperous as the North.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Panic of 1857 and sectional realignments====\n[[File:abraham-lincoln.png|200px|thumb|left|\"Vote yourself a farm\u2013 vote yourself a tariff\": a campaign slogan for [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}]]\n\nA few historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} believe that the serious financial [[Panic of 1857]] and the economic difficulties leading up to it strengthened the Republican Party and heightened sectional tensions. Before the panic, strong economic growth was being achieved under relatively low tariffs. Hence much of the nation concentrated on growth and prosperity.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe iron and textile industries were facing acute, worsening trouble each year after 1850. By 1854, stocks of iron were accumulating in each world market. Iron prices fell, forcing many American iron mills to shut down.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nRepublicans urged western farmers and northern manufacturers to blame the depression on the domination of the low-tariff economic policies of southern-controlled Democratic administrations. However, the depression revived suspicion of Northeastern banking interests in both the South and the West. Eastern demand for western farm products shifted the West closer to the North. As the \"transportation revolution\" (canals and railroads) went forward, an increasingly large share and absolute amount of [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], and other staples of western producers\u2014once difficult to haul across the [[Appalachians]]\u2014went to markets in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. The depression emphasized the value of the western markets for eastern goods and homesteaders who would furnish markets and respectable profits.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAside from the land issue, economic difficulties strengthened the Republican case for higher tariffs for industries in response to the depression. This issue was important in Pennsylvania and perhaps New Jersey.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Southern response====\n[[File:National-atlas-1970-1860.png|right|thumb|300px|The United States, immediately before the Civil War. All of the lands east of, or bordering, the Mississippi River were organized as states in the Union, but the West was still largely unsettled.]]\n\nMeanwhile, many Southerners grumbled over \"radical\" notions of giving land away to farmers that would \"abolitionize\" the area. While the ideology of Southern sectionalism was well-developed before the Panic of 1857 by figures like J.D.B. De Bow, the panic helped convince even more cotton barons that they had grown too reliant on Eastern financial interests.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[Thomas Prentice Kettell]], former editor of the ''Democratic Review'', was another commentator popular in the South to enjoy a great degree of prominence between 1857 and 1860. Kettell gathered an array of statistics in his book on ''Southern Wealth and Northern Profits'', to show that the South produced vast wealth, while the North, with its dependence on raw materials, siphoned off the wealth of the South.<ref name=\"Donald, 1961\">{{cite book |last=Donald |first=David |author2=Randal, J.G. |title=The Civil War and Reconstruction |location=Boston |publisher=D.C. Health and Company |year=1961 |page=79}}</ref> Arguing that sectional inequality resulted from the concentration of manufacturing in the North, and from the North's supremacy in communications, transportation, finance, and international trade, his ideas paralleled old [[physiocratic]] doctrines that all profits of manufacturing and trade come out of the land.<ref name=\"Allan, 1947\">{{cite book |last=Allan |first=Nevins |title=Ordeal of the Union (vol. 3) |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1947 |volume=III |page=218}}</ref> Political sociologists, such as Barrington Moore, have noted that these forms of romantic nostalgia tend to crop up whenever industrialization takes hold.<ref name=\"Moore\">Moore, Barrington, p.122.</ref>\n\nSuch Southern hostility to the free farmers gave the North an opportunity for an alliance with Western farmers. After the political realignments of 1857\u201358\u2014manifested by the emerging strength of the Republican Party and their networks of local support nationwide\u2014almost every issue was entangled with the controversy over the expansion of slavery in the West. While questions of tariffs, banking policy, public land, and subsidies to railroads did not always unite all elements in the North and the Northwest against the interests of slaveholders in the South under the pre-1854 party system, they were translated in terms of sectional conflict\u2014with the expansion of slavery in the West involved.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAs the depression strengthened the Republican Party, slaveholding interests were becoming convinced that the North had aggressive and hostile designs on the Southern way of life. The South was thus increasingly fertile ground for secessionism.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Republicans' Whig-style personality-driven \"hurrah\" campaign helped stir hysteria in the slave states upon the emergence of Lincoln and intensify divisive tendencies, while Southern \"fire eaters\" gave credence to notions of the slave power conspiracy among Republican constituencies in the North and West. New Southern demands to re-open the [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave trade]] further fueled sectional tensions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFrom the early 1840s until the outbreak of the Civil War, the cost of slaves had been rising steadily. Meanwhile, the price of cotton was experiencing market fluctuations typical of raw commodities. After the Panic of 1857, the price of cotton fell while the price of slaves continued its steep rise. At the 1858 Southern commercial convention, William L. Yancey of [[Alabama]] called for the reopening of the African slave trade. Only the delegates from the states of the Upper South, who profited from the domestic trade, opposed the reopening of the slave trade since they saw it as a potential form of competition. The convention in 1858 wound up voting to recommend the repeal of all laws against slave imports, despite some reservations.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===John Brown and Harpers Ferry (1859)===\n{{Main|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry}}\nOn October 16, 1859, radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] led an attempt to start an armed slave revolt by seizing the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|U.S. Army arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry, Virginia]] (now West Virginia). Brown and twenty followers, both whites (including two of Brown's sons) and blacks (three free blacks, one freedman, and one fugitive slave), planned to seize the armory and use weapons stored there to arm black slaves in order to spark a general uprising by the slave population.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAlthough the raiders were initially successful in cutting the telegraph line and capturing the armory, they allowed a passing train to continue on to Washington, D.C., where the authorities were alerted to the attack. By October 17 the raiders were surrounded in the armory by the militia and other locals. [[Robert E. Lee]] (then a colonel in the U.S. Army) led a company of U.S. Marines in storming the armory on October 18. Ten of the raiders were killed, including both of Brown's sons; Brown himself along with a half dozen of his followers were captured; four of the raiders escaped immediate capture. Six locals were killed and nine injured; the Marines suffered one dead and one injured. The local slave population failed to join in Brown's attack.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nBrown was subsequently hanged for treason ([[Virginia v. John Brown|against the Commonwealth of Virginia]]), as were six of his followers. The raid became a [[:wikt:cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre|cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] in both the North and the South, with Brown vilified by Southerners as a bloodthirsty fanatic, but celebrated by many Northern abolitionists as a martyr to the cause of ending slavery.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Elections of 1860===\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|right|thumb|350px|1860 electoral map]]\n{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1860}}\n\nInitially, [[William H. Seward]] of New York, [[Salmon P. Chase]] of Ohio, and [[Simon Cameron]] of Pennsylvania were the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. But [[Abraham Lincoln]], a former one-term House member who gained fame amid the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates]] of 1858, had fewer political opponents within the party and outmaneuvered the other contenders. On May 16, 1860, he received the Republican nomination at their convention in [[Chicago]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe schism in the Democratic Party over the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and Douglas' [[Freeport Doctrine]] caused Southern \"[[Fire-Eaters]]\" to oppose front runner [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Douglas defeated the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas because the majority of Kansans were antislavery, and Douglas' popular sovereignty doctrine would allow the majority to vote slavery up or down as they chose. Douglas' Freeport Doctrine alleged that the antislavery majority of Kansans could thwart the [[Dred Scott]] decision that allowed slavery by withholding legislation for a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. As a result, Southern extremists demanded a slave code for the territories, and used this issue to divide the northern and southern wings of the Democratic Party. Southerners left the party and in June nominated [[John C. Breckinridge]], while Northern Democrats supported Douglas. As a result, the Southern planter class lost a considerable measure of sway in national politics. Because of the Democrats' division, the Republican nominee faced a divided opposition. Adding to Lincoln's advantage, ex-[[United States Whig Party|Whigs]] from the border states had earlier formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], nominating [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John C. Bell]] for president. Thus, party nominees waged regional campaigns. Douglas and Lincoln competed for Northern votes, while Bell, Douglas and Breckinridge competed for Southern votes.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n====Result and impact of the election of 1860====\nLincoln handily won the electoral votes:<ref>{{cite web|title=1860 Presidential Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1860|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref>\n* '''''Abraham Lincoln: 180 (39.7% of the [[Direct election|popular vote]])'''''\n* '''J.C. Breckinridge''': 72 (18.2% of the popular vote)\n* '''John Bell''': 39 (12.6% of the popular vote)\n* '''Stephen A. Douglas''': 12 (29.5% of the popular vote)\nVoting [on November 6, 1860] split sharply along sectional lines. Lincoln was elected by carrying the electoral votes of the North; he had a sweeping majority of 180 electoral votes. Given the vote count in each state, he would still have won the electoral college even if all three opponents had somehow been able to merge their tickets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Split in the Democratic Party===\nThe Alabama extremist [[William Lowndes Yancey]]'s demand for a federal slave code for the territories split the Democratic Party between North and South, which made the election of Lincoln possible. Yancey tried to make his demand for a slave code moderate enough to get Southern support and yet extreme enough to enrage Northerners and split the party. He demanded that the party support a slave code for the territories ''if later necessary'', so that the demand would be conditional enough to win Southern support. His tactic worked, and lower South delegates left the Democratic Convention at Institute Hall in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and walked over to Military Hall. The South Carolina extremist [[Robert Barnwell Rhett]] hoped that the lower South would completely break with the Northern Democrats and attend a separate convention at [[Richmond, Virginia]], but lower South delegates gave the national Democrats one last chance at unification by going to the convention at [[Baltimore, Maryland]], before the split became permanent. The end result was that [[John C. Breckinridge]] became the candidate of the Southern Democrats, and [[Stephen Douglas]] became the candidate of the Northern Democrats.<ref name=\"DemocraticPartySplit\">William W, Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion: Secessionists Triumphant 1854\u20131861'', pages 271\u2013341</ref>\n\nYancey's previous 1848 attempt at demanding a slave code for the territories was his [[Alabama Platform]], which was in response to the Northern [[Wilmot Proviso]] attempt at banning slavery in territories conquered from [[Mexico]]. Justice [[Peter V. Daniel]] wrote a letter about the Proviso to former President [[Martin Van Buren]]: \"It is that view of the case which pretends to an insulting exclusiveness or superiority on the one hand, and denounces a degrading inequality or inferiority on the other; which says in effect to the Southern man, 'Avaunt! you are not my equal, and hence are to be excluded as carrying a moral taint with you.' Here is at once the extinction of all fraternity, of all sympathy, of all endurance even; the creation of animosity fierce, implacable, undying.\"<ref>Don E. Fehrenbacher (1978/2001), New York: Oxford, Part III, ''Echoes and Consequences'', Chapter 22, \"Reasons Why\" [cf. \"[[Charge of the Light Brigade]]\"], p. 561; Daniel to Van Buren, November 1, 1847, Martin Van Buren Papers, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress.</ref> Both the Alabama Platform and the Wilmot Proviso failed, but Yancey learned to be less overtly radical in order to get more support. Southerners thought they were merely demanding equality, in that they wanted Southern property in slaves to get the same (or more) protection as Northern forms of property.<ref name=\"DemocraticPartySplit\" />\n\n===Southern secession===\n[[File:Charleston Mercury Secession Broadside, 1860.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The first published Confederate imprint of secession]]\nWith the emergence of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West\u2014the focal point of sectional tensions\u2014was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But Democrats suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.<ref>Roy Nichols, ''The Disruption of American Democracy: A History of the Political Crisis That Led up to the Civil War'' (1949)</ref>\n\nImmediately after finding out the election results, a special [[South Carolina]] convention declared \"that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states under the name of the 'United States of America' is hereby dissolved;\" by February six more cotton states would follow (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas), forming the [[Confederate States of America]]. In 1960, Lipset examined the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860\u201361. In each state he divided the counties by the proportion of slaves, low, medium and high. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties, the vote was only 37% for secession, and in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was at 60%.<ref>Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics'' (Doubleday, 1960) p. 349.</ref> Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and the incoming Lincoln administration refused to recognize the legality of secession or the legitimacy of the Confederacy. After Lincoln called for troops, four border states (that lacked cotton) seceded (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee).<ref>Maury Klein, ''Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War'' (1999)</ref> The Upper Southern States were in a dilemma: they wanted to retain their slaves but were afraid that if they joined with the lower southern states that were rebelling they would be caught in the middle of a conflict, and their states would be the battle ground. By staying in the Union the Upper Southern states felt that their slave rights would continue to be recognized by the Union.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Other issues===\nThe [[tariff]] issue was and is sometimes cited\u2013long after the war\u2013by [[Lost Cause]] historians and [[neo-Confederate]] apologists. In 1860\u201361 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession brought up the tariff issue as a major issue.<ref>Robert Gray Gunderson, ''Old Gentleman's Convention: The Washington Peace Conference of 1861''.

The upper South, where 32 percent of the population were slaves, considered the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter crisis]]\u2014especially [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|Lincoln's call for troops]] to march south to recapture it\u2014a cause for secession. The northernmost border slave states, where 13 percent of the population were slaves, did not secede.<ref>Daniel Crofts, ''Reluctant Confederates: Upper South Unionists in the Secession Crisis'' (1989)</ref>\n\n==Fort Sumter==\nWhen [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina seceded]] in December 1860, Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]], a pro-slavery, former slave owner from [[Kentucky]], remained loyal to the Union. He was the commanding officer of United States Army forces in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]\u2014the last remaining important Union post in the [[Deep South]]. Acting upon orders from the War Department to hold and defend the U.S. forts, he moved his small garrison from [[Fort Moultrie]], which was indefensible, to the more modern, more defensible, [[Fort Sumter]] in the middle of [[Charleston Harbor]]. South Carolina leaders cried betrayal, while the North celebrated with enormous excitement at this show of defiance against secessionism. In February 1861 the [[Confederate States of America]] were formed and took charge. Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, ordered the fort be captured. The artillery attack was commanded by [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[P. G. T. Beauregard]], who had been Anderson's student at West Point. The attack began April 12, 1861, and continued until Anderson, badly outnumbered and outgunned, surrendered the fort on April 14. The battle began the American Civil War, as an overwhelming demand for war swept both the North and South, with only Kentucky attempting to remain neutral.<ref>Adam Goodheart, ''1861: The Civil War Awakening '' (2011) ch 2\u20135</ref>\n[[File:Fort Sumter telegram.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Robert Anderson's telegram announcing the surrender of Fort Sumter]]\n\nAccording to Adam Goodheart (2011), the modern meaning of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] was also forged in the defense of Fort Sumter. Thereafter, the flag was used throughout the North to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\n\n{{quote|Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like the [[Fourth of July]]. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew \u2013 as it does today, and especially as it did after [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] \u2013 from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.<ref>Adam Goodheart, \"Prologue\", in  ''1861: The Civil War Awakening '' (2011)</ref>}}\n\n==Onset of the Civil War and the question of compromise==\n[[File:HenryWilson.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Wilson]], author of ''[[History of The Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America]]'' (1872\u20131877)]]\n\nAbraham Lincoln's rejection of the [[Crittenden Compromise]], the failure to secure the ratification of the [[Corwin Amendment]] in 1861, and the inability of the Washington [[Peace Conference of 1861]] to provide an effective alternative to Crittenden and Corwin came together to prevent a compromise that is still debated by Civil War historians. Even as the war was going on, William Seward and James Buchanan were outlining a debate over the question of inevitability that would continue among historians.<ref>Steven E. Woodworth, ed., ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996) pp 131-43</ref>\n\n===Needless war argument===\nTwo competing explanations of the sectional tensions inflaming the nation emerged even before the war. The first was the \"Needless War\" argument.<ref>Thomas J. Pressly, ''Americans Interpret Their Civil War'' (1954) pp 127-48</ref> Buchanan believed the sectional hostility to be the accidental, unnecessary work of self-interested or fanatical agitators. He also singled out the \"fanaticism\" of the Republican Party. Seward, on the other hand, believed there to be an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces. Shelden argues that, \"Few scholars in the twenty-first century would call the Civil War 'needless,' as the emancipation of 4 million slaves hinged on Union victory.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Rachel A. Shelden|title=Washington Brotherhood: Politics, Social Life, and the Coming of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZj9AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|year=2013|publisher=U of North Carolina Press|page=5}}</ref>\n\n===Irrepressible conflict argument===\nThe \"Irrepressible Conflict\" argument was the first to dominate historical discussion.<ref>Thomas J. Pressly, ''Americans Interpret Their Civil War'' (1954) pp 149-226</ref> In the first decades after the fighting, histories of the Civil War generally reflected the views of Northerners who had participated in the conflict. The war appeared to be a stark moral conflict in which the South was to blame, a conflict that arose as a result of the designs of slave power. [[Henry Wilson]]'s ''[[History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America]]'' (1872\u20131877) is the foremost representative of this moral interpretation, which argued that Northerners had fought to preserve the union against the aggressive designs of \"slave power\". Later, in his seven-volume ''History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 to the Civil War'' (1893\u20131900), [[James Ford Rhodes]] identified slavery as the central\u2014and virtually only\u2014cause of the Civil War. The North and South had reached positions on the issue of slavery that were both irreconcilable and unalterable. The conflict had become inevitable.{{citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n===Revisionists===\nBut the idea that the war was avoidable became central among historians in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Revisionist historians, led by [[James G. Randall]] (1881\u20131953) at the University of Illinois and [[Avery Craven]] (1885\u20131980) at the University of Chicago, saw in the social and economic systems of the South no differences so fundamental as to require a war. Historian [[Mark E. Neely Jr.|Mark Neely]] explains their position:\n\n<blockquote>Revisionism challenged the view that fundamental and irreconcilable sectional differences made the outbreak of war inevitable. It scorned a previous generation's easy identification of the Northern cause with abolition, but it continued a tradition of hostility to the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] measures that followed the war. The Civil War became a needless conflict brought on by a blundering generation that exaggerated sectional differences between North and South. Revisionists revived the reputation of the Democratic party as great nationalists before the war and as dependable loyalists during it. Revisionism gave Lincoln's Presidency a tragic beginning at Fort Sumter, a rancorous political setting of bitter factional conflicts between radicals and moderates within Lincoln's own party, and an even more tragic ending. The benevolent Lincoln died at the moment when benevolence was most needed to blunt radical designs for revenge on the South.<ref>Mark E. Neely, \"The Lincoln Theme since Randall's Call: The Promises and Perils of Professionalism.\" ''Papers of the Abraham Lincoln Association'' 1 (1979): 10-70. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0001.104/--lincoln-theme-since-randalls-call-the-promises-and-perils?rgn=main;view=fulltext online]</ref></blockquote>\n\nRandall blamed the ineptitude of a \"blundering generation\" of leaders. He also saw slavery as essentially a benign institution, crumbling in the presence of 19th century tendencies.<ref>James G. Randall, \"The Blundering Generation.\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 27.1 (1940): 3-28. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1896569 in JSTOR]</ref> Craven, the other leading revisionist, placed more emphasis on the issue of slavery than Randall but argued roughly the same points. In ''The Coming of the Civil War'' (1942), Craven argued that slave laborers were not much worse off than Northern workers, that the institution was already on the road to ultimate extinction, and that the war could have been averted by skillful and responsible leaders in the tradition of Congressional statesmen [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. Two of the key leaders in antebellum politics, Clay and Webster, in contrast to the 1850s generation of leaders, shared a predisposition to compromises marked by a passionate patriotic devotion to the Union.<ref>Avery Craven, ''The Coming of the Civil War'' (1942).</ref><ref>Avery Craven, \"Coming of the War Between the States: An Interpretation.\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 2#3 (1936): 303-322. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2191911 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nBut it is possible that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of the political debate). [[David Herbert Donald]] (1920\u20132009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in a society in which traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.<ref>David H. Donald, \"Died of Democracy.\" in Donald, ed., ''Why the North Won the Civil War'' (1960) pp: 79-90.</ref>\n\n==Contemporaneous explanations==\n<div class=\"noprint\" style=\"clear:right; float:right; margin:0 0 1.0em 1.0em; width:250px; border:solid #aaa 1px; padding:4px; background:#f9f9f9; spacing:0px; text-align:left; font-size:90%;\">\n<div style=\"float:left;\">[[File:wikisource-logo.jpg|50px|none|Wikisource]]</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:60px;\">[[Wikisource]] has the original text of\n<div style=\"margin-left:10px;\">\"'''[[s:The Barbarism of Slavery|The Barbarism of Slavery]]'''\"</div>\n</div></div>\n\nIn December 1860, amid the secession crisis, president-elect Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter to [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]], in which he summarized the cause of the crisis:\n\n{{quote|You think slavery is right and should be extended; while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted. That I suppose is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference between us.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=To Alexander H. Stephens|date=December 22, 1860|url=http://www.civilwarcauses.org/aleck.htm|work=Civil War Causes|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nSeveral months later, on March 21, 1861, Alexander Stephens, now the Confederate vice president, delivered his \"[[Cornerstone Speech]]\" in Savannah, Georgia. In the speech, he states that slavery was the cause of the secession crisis, and outlines the principal differences between Confederate ideology and U.S. ideology:\n\n{{quote|The new [Confederate] Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions\u2014African slavery as it exists among us\u2014the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. ...{{bracket|Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's}} ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. ...Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery \u2013 subordination to the superior race \u2013 is his natural and normal condition.}}\n\nIn July 1863, as decisive campaigns were fought at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], Republican senator [[Charles Sumner]] re-dedicated his speech [[S:The Barbarism of Slavery|The Barbarism of Slavery]] and said that desire to preserve slavery was the sole cause of the war:\n\n{{quote|[T]here are two apparent rudiments to this war. One is Slavery and the other is State Rights. But the latter is only a cover for the former. If Slavery were out of the way there would be no trouble from State Rights.\n\nThe war, then, is for Slavery, and nothing else. It is an insane attempt to vindicate by arms the lordship which had been already asserted in debate. With mad-cap audacity it seeks to install this Barbarism as the truest Civilization. Slavery is declared to be the \"corner-stone\" of the new edifice.}}\n\nLincoln's war goals were reactions to the war, as opposed to causes. Abraham Lincoln explained the nationalist goal as the preservation of the Union on August 22, 1862, one month before his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation:\n\n{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be \"the Union as it was.\"... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. ...I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.<ref>[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm Letter to Horace Greeley], August 22, 1862</ref>}}\n\nOn March 4, 1865, Lincoln said in his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]] that slavery was the cause of the War:\n\n{{quote|One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[American Civil War]]\n* [[Compensated emancipation]]\n* [[Conclusion of the American Civil War]]\n* [[Issues of the American Civil War]]\n* [[Slavery in the United States]]\n* [[Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Craven, Avery.

The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced. Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the major senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality represents the sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sensation and perception of touch, which is known as somatosensation, can be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement, while the general sensation and perception of taste can be separated into submodalities of [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]], all of which are based on different chemicals binding to [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|title=Anatomy and Physiology|publisher=Rice University (OpenStax)|date=2016-02-26|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Receptors ===\n{{Main|Sensory receptor}}\nSensory receptors are the cells or structures that detect sensations. [[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the [[peripheral nervous system]]. During transduction, physical stimulus is converted into [[action potential]] by receptors and transmitted towards the [[central nervous system]] for processing.<ref name=\"mcb\" /> Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of [[Sensory neuron|receptor cells]]. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: [[Sensory neuron|cell type]], position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position in relation to stimuli they sense. Receptors can further be classified functionally on the basis of the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell [[membrane potential]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Structural receptor types ====\n\n===== Location =====\nOne way to classify receptors is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An [[Exteroception|exteroceptor]] is a receptor that is located near a stimulus of the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in the skin. An [[Interoception|interoceptor]] is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the [[aorta]] or [[carotid sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Cell type =====\nThe cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a [[neuron]] that has a [[free nerve ending]], with [[dendrite]]s embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in [[connective tissue]] that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specialized [[Sensory neuron|receptor cell]], which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus. The [[Nociceptor|pain]] and [[Thermoreceptor|temperature receptors]] in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings (1). Also located in the dermis of the skin are [[Pacinian corpuscle|lamellated corpuscles]], neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch (2). The cells in the retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor (3), a [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA [[transmembrane protein]] receptor is a protein in the [[cell membrane]] that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of [[ion channel]]s or changes in the [[cell signaling]] processes. Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called [[ligand]]s. For example, a molecule in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors, are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane, and can generate an [[action potential]] or a [[graded potential]] in the [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Functional receptor types ====\nA third classification of receptors is by how the receptor [[Transduction (physiology)|transduces]] stimuli into [[membrane potential]] changes. Stimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and [[macromolecule]]s that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReceptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. The different types of functional receptor cell types are [[mechanoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptor]]s ([[osmoreceptor]]), [[thermoreceptor]]s, and [[nociceptor]]s. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor.  Photoreceptors convert light (visible [[electromagnetic radiation]]) into signals. Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object's taste or smell, while osmoreceptors respond to a chemical solute concentrations of body fluids. Nociception (pain) interprets the presence of tissue damage, from sensory information from mechano-, chemo-, and thermoreceptors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of neural science|date=1991|publisher=Appleton & Lange|others=Kandel, Eric R., Schwartz, James H.

This minimum amount of stimulus is called the absolute threshold.<ref name=\"pri\" /> The absolute threshold is defined as the minimum amount of stimulation necessary for the detection of a stimulus 50% of the time.<ref name=\"wol\">{{cite book|last1=Wolfe|first1=Jeremy|title=Sensation & perception|last2=Kluender|first2=Keith|last3=Levi|first3=Dennis|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=978-0-87893-572-7|edition=3rd|page=7|year=2012}}</ref> Absolute threshold is measured by using a method called [[signal detection]]. This process involves presenting stimuli of varying intensities to a subject in order to determine the level at which the subject can reliably detect stimulation in a given sense.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n==== Differential threshold ====\n{{Main|Differential threshold}}\nDifferential threshold or just noticeable difference (JDS) is the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli, or the smallest difference in stimuli that can be judged to be different from each other.<ref name=\"wol\" /> [[Weber's Law]] is an empirical law that states that the difference threshold is a constant fraction of the comparison stimulus.<ref name=\"wol\" /> According to Weber's Law, bigger stimuli require larger differences to be noticed.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n[[File:Power_exponents_and_Steven's_Power_Law.svg|thumb|Human power exponents and Steven&#x27;s Power Law]]\n[[Psychophysics#Magnitude estimation|Magnitude estimation]] is a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] method in which subjects assign perceived values of given stimuli. The relationship between stimulus intensity and perceptive intensity is described by [[Steven's power law]].<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Signal detection theory ===\n{{Main|Signal detection theory}}\nSignal detection theory quantifies the experience of the subject to the presentation of a stimulus in the presence of [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]. There is internal noise and there is external noise when it comes to signal detection. The internal noise originates from static in the nervous system. For example, an individual with closed eyes in a dark room still sees something - a blotchy pattern of grey with intermittent brighter flashes -, this is internal noise. External noise is the result of noise in the environment that can interfere with the detection of the stimulus of interest. Noise is only a problem if the magnitude of the noise is large enough to interfere with signal collection. The [[nervous system]] calculates a criterion, or an internal threshold, for the detection of a signal in the presence of noise. If a signal is judged to be above the criterion, thus the signal is differentiated from the noise, the signal is sensed and perceived. Errors in signal detection can potentially lead to [[false positives and false negatives]]. The sensory criterion might be shifted based on the importance of the detecting the signal. Shifting of the criterion may influence the likelihood of false positives and false negatives.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Private perceptive experience ===\n{{Main|Qualia}}\nSubjective visual and auditory experiences appear to be similar across humans subjects. The same cannot be said about taste. For example, there is a molecule called [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) that some humans experience as bitter, some as almost tasteless, while others experience it as somewhere between tasteless and bitter. There is a genetic basis for this difference between perception given the same sensory stimulus. This subjective difference in taste perception has implications for individuals' food preferences, and consequently, health.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory adaptation ===\n{{Main|Sensory adaptation}}\nWhen a stimulus is constant and unchanging, perceptual sensory adaptation occurs. During this process, the subject becomes less sensitive to the stimulus.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n=== Fourier analysis ===\n{{Main|Fourier analysis}}\nBiological auditory (hearing), vestibular and spatial, and visual systems (vision) appear to break down real-world complex stimuli into [[sine wave]] components, through the mathematical process called Fourier analysis. Many neurons have a strong preference for certain sine [[frequency]] components in contrast to others. The way that simpler sounds and images are [[Code|encoded]] during sensation can provide insight into how perception of real-world objects happens.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory neuroscience and the biology of perception ===\n{{Main|Sensory neuroscience}}\nPerception occurs when [[nerve]]s that lead from the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory organs]] (e.g. eye) to the brain are stimulated, even if that stimulation is unrelated to the target signal of the sensory organ. For example, in the case of the eye, it does not matter whether light or something else stimulates the optic nerve, that stimulation will results in visual perception, even if there was no visual stimulus to begin with. (To prove this point to yourself (and if you are a human), close your eyes (preferably in a dark room) and press gently on the outside corner of one eye through the eyelid. You will see a visual spot toward the inside of your visual field, near your nose.)<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Sensory nervous system ====\n{{Main|Sensory nervous system}}\nAll stimuli received by the [[Sensory neuron|receptors]] are [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] to an [[action potential]], which is carried along one or more afferent [[neuron]]<nowiki/>s towards a specific area ([[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]) of the [[brain]]. Just as different nerves are dedicated to sensory and motors tasks, different areas of the brain (cortices) are similarly dedicated to different [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] tasks. More complex processing is accomplished across primary cortical regions that spread beyond the primary cortices. Every nerve, [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] or [[Motor nerve|motor]], has its own signal transmission speed. For example, nerves in the frog's legs have a 90&nbsp;ft/s (99&nbsp;km/h) signal transmission speed, while sensory nerves in humans, transmit sensory information at speeds between 165&nbsp;ft/s (181&nbsp;km/h) and 330&nbsp;ft/s (362&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"wol\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The [[human]] external sensory and perceptual system<ref name=\"wol\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n![[Stimulus (physiology)|Physical stimulus]]\n!Sensory organ\n![[Sensory receptor]]\n![[Sensory system]]\n![[Cranial nerves|Cranial nerve(s)]]\n![[Cerebral cortex]]\n!Primary associated [[Perception|perception(s]])\n!Name\n|-\n|[[Light]]\n|[[Human eye|Eyes]]\n|[[Photoreceptor cell|Photoreceptor]]\n|[[Visual system]]\n|[[Optic (II) nerve|Optic (II)]]\n|[[Visual cortex]]\n|[[Visual perception]]\n|[[Visual perception|Vision]]\n|-\n|[[Sound]]\n|[[Ear]]s\n|[[Mechanoreceptor]]\n|[[Auditory system]]\n|[[Vestibulocochlear nerve|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)]]\n|[[Auditory cortex]]\n|[[Auditory perception]]\n|[[Hearing|Hearing (audition)]]\n|-\n|[[Gravity]] and [[acceleration]]\n|[[Inner ear]]\n|Mechanoreceptor\n|[[Vestibular system]]\n|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)\n|[[Vestibular cortex]]\n|[[Equilibrioception]]\n|[[Balance (ability)|Balance (equilibrium)]] \n|-\n|[[Chemical substance]]\n|[[Human nose|Nose]]\n|[[Chemoreceptor]]\n|[[Olfactory system]]\n|[[Olfactory nerve|Olfactory (I)]]\n|[[Olfactory cortex]]\n|[[Olfactory perception]], Gustatory perception (taste or flavor)<ref>Small DM, Green BG.

Multimodality integrates different senses into one unified perceptual experience. Information from one sense has the potential to influence how information from another is perceived.<ref name=\"pri\" /> Multimodal perception is qualitatively different from unimodal perception. There has been a growing body of evidence since the mid-1990s on the neural correlates of multimodal perception.<ref name=\"cal\">Calvert, G.A., Hansen, P.C., Iversen, S.D. and Brammer, M.J., 2001.

Smell and taste are both responsible for identifying molecules and thus both are types of [[chemoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s. Both olfaction (smell) and gustation (taste) require the transduction of chemical stimuli into electrical potentials.<ref name=\"pri\" /><ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Visual system (vision) ====\n{{Main|Visual system}}\nThe visual system, or sense of sight, is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes and contributes to [[visual perception]]. The visual system detects [[light]] on [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the [[retina]] of each eye that generates electrical [[Action potential|nerve impulses]] for the perception of varying colors and brightness. There are two types of photoreceptors: [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]]. Rods are very sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors. Cones distinguish colors but are less sensitive to dim light.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a [[photon]], which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The [[energy]] of a photon is represented by its [[wavelength]], with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular [[color]]. Visible light is [[electromagnetic radiation]] with a wavelength between 380 and 720&nbsp;nm. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation longer than 720&nbsp;nm fall into the [[infrared]] range, whereas wavelengths shorter than 380&nbsp;nm fall into the [[ultraviolet]] range. Light with a wavelength of 380&nbsp;nm is [[blue]] whereas light with a wavelength of 720&nbsp;nm is dark [[red]]. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe three types of cone [[opsin]]<nowiki/>s, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision. By comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can extract color information from visual stimuli. For example, a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450&nbsp;nm would activate the \u201cred\u201d cones minimally, the \u201cgreen\u201d cones marginally, and the \u201cblue\u201d cones predominantly. The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by the brain, which perceives the color as blue. However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the color of light. Therefore, our low-light vision is\u2014in essence\u2014in [[grayscale]]. In other words, in a dark room, everything appears as a shade of [[Grey|gray]]. If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what color something is and is relying on that memory.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether the visual system consists of one, two, or thre submodalities. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two submodalities, given that different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that [[stereopsis]], the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the [[visual cortex]] of the brain where patterns and objects in [[Real image|images]] are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.\n\nThe inability to see is called [[blindness]]. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from [[stroke]] ([[infarct]]s in the brain).  Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications. People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as [[blindsight]]. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behavior to the stimulus.\n\nOn February 14, 2013 researchers developed a [[neural implant]] that gives [[rat]]s the ability to sense [[infrared]] light which for the first time provides [[living creatures]] with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.<ref>{{cite journal|date=14 February 2013|title=Implant gives rats sixth sense for infrared light|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/14/implant-gives-rats-sixth-sense-for-infrared-light|journal=Wired UK|access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''Visual Perception in Psychology'''\n\n''Main Article:'' [[Gestalt psychology]]\n\nAccording to Gestalt Psychology, people perceive the whole of something even if it is not there. The Gestalt\u2019s Law of Organization states that people have seven factors that help to group what is seen into patterns or groups: Common Fate, Similarity, Proximity, Closure, Symmetry, Continuity, and Past Experience.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kohler|first=Wolfgang|title=Gestalt Psychology: An Introduction to New Concepts in Modern Psychology|publisher=Liveright Publishing Corporation|year=1947|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Law of Common fate says that objects are led along the smoothest path.

We may see 42 objects in a group, but we can also perceive three groups of two lines with seven objects in each line. <ref name=\":12\" />\n\nThe Law of Closure is the idea that we as humans still see a full picture even if there are gaps within that picture.

We tend to perceive all of the words in the parentheses as one section instead of individual words within the parentheses.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\nThe Law of Continuity tells us that objects are grouped together by their elements and then perceived as a whole. This usually happens when we see overlapping objects.We will see the overlapping objects with no interruptions.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\nThe Law of Past Experience refers to the tendency humans have to categorize objects according to past experiences under certain circumstances. If two objects are usually perceived together or within close proximity of each other the Law of Past Experience is usually seen.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Auditory system (hearing) ====\n{{Main|Auditory system}}\nHearing, or audition, is the transduction of [[sound waves]] into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of the [[ear]]. The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricle]]. At the end of the [[auditory canal]] is the tympanic membrane, or [[Eardrum|ear drum]], which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the [[external ear]]. The [[middle ear]] consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the [[ossicles]]. The three ossicles are the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]], which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the [[inner ear]], where the sound waves will be [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] into a neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the [[pharynx]] through the [[Eustachian tube]], which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during [[swallowing]] or [[yawn]]ing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the [[inner ear]], which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000&nbsp;[[hertz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing, Physics Factbook by Glenn Elert (ed)|date=|publisher=Hypertextbook.com|access-date=2014-04-05}}</ref> with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called [[deafness]] or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as [[Seismic communication|vibrations conducted through the body]] by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine the direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdeaf.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/Information%20Sheets/Deaf%20Culture%20and%20Communication%20-%20A%20Basic%20Guide.pdf|title=Deaf Culture and Communication: A Basic Guide|year=2010|work=Victorian Deaf Society}}</ref>\n\nStudies pertaining to Audition started to increase in number towards the latter end of the nineteenth century. During this time, many laboratories in the United States began to create new models, diagrams, and instruments that all pertained to the ear.  <ref>{{Cite document|title=Early Auditory Studies: Activities in the Psychology Laboratories of American Universities|year = 1975|hdl = 10088/2430|last1 = Davis|first1 = Audrey B.}}</ref>\n\nThere is a branch of Cognitive Psychology dedicated strictly to Audition. They call it Auditory Cognitive Psychology.

Somatosensation is the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch and interoception. The modalities of somatosensation include [[pressure]], [[vibration]], light touch, [[Tickling|tickle]], [[itch]], [[temperature]], [[pain]], [[kinesthesia]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Somatosensation]], also called [[tactition]]  (adjectival form: tactile) is a perception resulting from activation of neural [[Mechanoreceptor|receptors]], generally in the [[skin]] including [[hair follicle]]s, but also in the [[tongue]], [[throat]], and [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. A variety of [[pressure]] receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of [[itch]]ing caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord.<ref name=\"Sun Zhao 2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Sun YG, Zhao ZQ, Meng XL, Yin J, Liu XY, Chen ZF|date=September 2009|title=Cellular basis of itch sensation|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5947|pages=1531\u20134|bibcode=2009Sci...325.1531S|doi=10.1126/science.1174868|pmc=2786498|pmid=19661382}}</ref> The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile [[anesthesia]].  [[Paresthesia]] is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or [[numbness]] of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.\n\nTwo types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by [[free nerve ending]]s are pain and temperature. These two modalities use [[thermoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s and [[nociceptor]]s to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively. Temperature receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from [[body temperature]]. Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations. Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves [[capsaicin]], the active molecule in hot peppers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLow frequency vibrations are sensed by mechanoreceptors called [[Merkel cell]]s, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel cells are located in the [[stratum basale]] of the [[epidermis]]. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated ([[Pacinian corpuscle|Pacinian]]) corpuscles, which are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Light touch is transduced by the encapsulated endings known as tactile ([[Meissner corpuscle|Meissner]]) corpuscles. Follicles are also wrapped in a [[plexus]] of nerve endings known as the hair follicle plexus. These nerve endings detect the movement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an insect may be walking along the [[skin]]. Stretching of the skin is transduced by stretch receptors known as [[bulbous corpuscle]]s. Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in [[pit vipers]]. The [[Thermoreceptor|thermoceptors]] in the skin are quite different from the [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] thermoceptors in the brain ([[POAH|hypothalamus]]), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.\n\n==== Vestibular system (balance) ====\n{{Main|Vestibular system}}\n\nThe vestibular sense, or sense of balance (equilibrium), is the sense that contributes to the perception of balance (equilibrium), spatial orientation, direction, or acceleration ([[equilibrioception]]). Along with audition, the [[inner ear]] is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium. A similar [[mechanoreceptor]]\u2014a hair cell with [[Stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]]\u2014senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion. These cells are located within the [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]], whereas head movement is sensed by the [[semicircular canals]]. The neural signals generated in the [[vestibular ganglion]] are transmitted through the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] to the [[Brainstem|brain stem]] and [[cerebellum]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately 45 degrees relative to the [[sagittal plane]]. The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the [[Ampullary cupula|ampulla]]. The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying \u201cno.\u201d The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the [[Ampullary cupula|cupula]], a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The semicircular canals contain several ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically. By comparing the relative movements of both the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect  the direction of most head movements within three-dimensional ([[Three-dimensional space|3D]]) space.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[vestibular nerve]] conducts information from sensory receptors in three [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] that sense motion of fluid in three [[semicircular canal]]s caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head.  The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]], which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of [[otolith]]s (which are small crystals of [[calcium carbonate]]) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.\n\n==== Gustatory system (taste) ====\n{{Main|Gustatory system}}\nThe gustatory system or the sense of taste is the [[sensory system]] that is partially responsible for the [[perception]] of [[Flavor|taste (flavor)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trivedi|first=Bijal P.|date=June 2012|title=Gustatory system: The finer points of taste|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7403|pages=S2\u2013S3|doi=10.1038/486s2a|pmid=22717400|bibcode=2012Natur.486S...2T|issn=0028-0836}}</ref>  A few recognized [[Stimulus modality|submodalities]] exist within taste: [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]]. Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste submodality for fats, or lipids.<ref name=\":0\" /> The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the [[multimodal integration]] of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, M. M. (Micah M.), editor. Wallace, Mark T., editor.|title=The neural bases of multisensory processes|isbn=978-1-4398-1219-8|oclc=759160178|date=2011-08-25}}</ref> \n[[File:Philippe_Mercier_-_The_Sense_of_Taste_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project]]\nWithin the structure of the [[lingual papillae]] are [[taste bud]]s that contain specialized gustatory receptor cells for the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release [[neurotransmitter]]s based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate [[sensory neuron]]s in the [[Facial nerve|facial]], [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]], and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] [[cranial nerves]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSalty and sour taste submodalities are triggered by the [[cations]] [[Na\u207a|Na+]] and [[Hydrogen ion|H+]], respectively. The other taste modalities result from food molecules binding to a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein\u2013coupled receptor]]. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to [[depolarization]] of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of [[glucose]] (or [[sugar substitute]]s) dissolved in the [[saliva]]. Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein\u2013coupled receptors. The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of G protein\u2013coupled receptors by a specific molecule.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnce the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release [[neurotransmitter]]s onto the [[dendrite]]s of sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within the vagus nerve dedicated to the [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus nerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the [[pharynx]], which are more sensitive to [[Noxious stimulus|noxious stimuli]] such as bitterness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFlavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste.

[[Odor|Odor molecules]] possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what humans perceive as the molecule's smell.<ref name=\"Moonwalk\">{{cite web|url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/sense-of-smell-olfactory-receptors.html|title=A Sense of Smell: Olfactory Receptors|date=2007-01-09|work=Sandwalk|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe olfactory receptor neurons are located in a small region within the [[Nasal cavity|superior nasal cavity]]. This region is referred to as the [[olfactory epithelium]] and contains [[Bipolar neuron|bipolar sensory neurons]]. Each olfactory sensory neuron has [[dendrite]]s that extend from the [[apical surface]] of the [[epithelium]] into the [[mucus]] lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the [[Human nose|nose]], they pass over the olfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant\u2013protein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein\u2013coupled, and will produce a graded [[membrane potential]] in the [[Olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory neurons]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n[[File:The_sense_of_smell_Philippe_Mercier.jpg|thumb|The sense of smell Bequest of [[Mrs E.G. Elgar]], 1945 [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].]]\nIn the [[Human brain|brain]], olfaction is processed by the [[olfactory cortex]]. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called [[anosmia]]. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect [[pheromone]]s.<ref name=\"LiveScience\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html|title=The Surprising Impact of Taste and Smell|work=LiveScience}}</ref> Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additional [[spice]] and [[seasoning]] levels for food to be tasted. Anosmia may also be related to some presentations of mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair. The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia. This explains why some elderly people salt their food more than younger people do.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCauses of Olfactory dysfunction can be caused by age, exposure to toxic chemicals, viral infections, epilepsy, some sort of neurodegenerative disease, head trauma, or as a result of another disorder. [5]\n\nAs studies in olfaction have continued, there has been a positive correlation to its dysfunction or degeneration and early signs of Alzheimers and sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Many patients don\u2019t notice the decline in smell before being tested. In Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Alzheimers, an olfactory deficit is present in 85 to 90% of the early onset cases. [5]There is evidence that the decline of this sense can precede the Alzheimers or Parkinson\u2019s Disease by a couple years. Although the deficit is present in these two diseases, as well as others, it is important to make note that the severity or magnitude vary with every disease. This has brought to light some suggestions that olfactory testing could be used in some cases to aid in differentiating many of the neurodegenerative diseases. [5]\n\nThose who were born without a sense of smell or have a damaged sense of smell usually complain about 1, or more, of 3 things. Our olfactory sense is also used as a warning against bad food. If the sense of smell is damaged or not there, it can lead to a person contracting food poisoning more often. Not having a sense of smell can also lead to damaged relationships or insecurities within the relationships because of the inability for the person to not smell body odor. Lastly, smell influences how food and drink taste. When the olfactory sense is damaged, the satisfaction from eating and drinking is not as prominent. \n\n=== Internal ===\n{{Main|Interoception}}\n\n==== Proprioception ====\n\n[[Proprioception]], the kinesthetic sense, provides the [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.<ref name=\"roblesdelatorre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf|title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments|work=International Society for Haptics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Pain ====\n\n[[Nociception]] (physiological [[pain]]) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] of the brain.<ref name=\"Fulbright 2001\">{{cite journal|authors=Fulbright RK, Troche CJ, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Wexler BE|date=November 2001|title=Functional MR imaging of regional brain activation associated with the affective experience of pain|journal=AJR.

For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts.

They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.\n\nBlind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as [[human echolocation]].\n\n==== Electroreception ====\n[[Electroreception]] (or electroception) is the ability to detect [[electric field]]s. Several species of fish, [[shark]]s, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]]. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social [[communication]]. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.\n\nThe only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the [[dolphin]] and [[monotreme]] orders. Among these mammals, the [[platypus]]<ref name=\"Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus\">{{cite web|url=http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html|title=Electroreceptive Mechanisms in the Platypus|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209085517/http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/bionb420.07/anelson/electrorecept.html|archive-date=1999-02-09|access-date=}}</ref> has the most acute sense of electroception.\n\nA dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in [[Whisker|vibrissal crypts]] arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors.<ref name=\"Drake 2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|year=2011|title=Life: Dolphin can sense electric fields: Ability may help species track prey in murky waters|journal=Science News|volume=180|issue=5|pages=12|doi=10.1002/scin.5591800512|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey.

An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.\n\n==== Hygroreception ====\n[[Hygroreception]] is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Enjin A, Zaharieva EE, Frank DD, Mansourian S, Suh GS, Gallio M, Stensmyr MC|date=May 2016|title=Humidity Sensing in Drosophila|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1352\u20138|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.03.049|pmc=5305172|pmid=27161501}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Tichy H, Kallina W|date=2013-01-16|title=The evaporative function of cockroach hygroreceptors|journal=PLOS One|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e53998|bibcode=2013PLoSO...853998T|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053998|pmc=3546976|pmid=23342058}}</ref>\n\n==== Infrared sensing ====\n{{Main|Infrared sensing in snakes}}\n\nThe ability to sense [[infrared]] thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of [[snakes]]. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to \"see\" radiant heat at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[\u03bcm]] to a degree of accuracy such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.<ref>(Kardong & Mackessy 1991)</ref> It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.<ref>(Krochmal et al. 2004)</ref> The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.<ref>(Pough et al. 1992)</ref> The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[Loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target [[Endotherm|endothermic]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision-making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.\n\nIn spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors \u2013 while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature-sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than a chemical reaction to light.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\">(Gracheva et al. 2010)</ref> This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original \"resting\" or \"inactive\" temperature.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\" />\n\n==== Other ====\nPressure detection uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the [[gas bladder]] to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the [[weather fish]] and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.\n\nCurrent detection is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of [[Vortex|vortices]], found in the [[lateral line]] of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are [[hair cell]]s, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the [[Electroception|electrical sense]] are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.\n\n[[Polarized light]] direction/detection is used by [[bees]] to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. [[Cuttlefish]], some [[beetles]], and [[mantis shrimp]] can also perceive the polarization of light.  Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called [[Haidinger's brush]], however this is considered an [[entoptic phenomenon]] rather than a separate sense.\n\n[[Slit sensilla]]e of spiders detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.\n\n== Plant sensation ==\nBy using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]].\n\nHowever, plants could perceive the world around them,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170109-plants-can-see-hear-and-smell-and-respond|title=Earth - Plants can see, hear and smell \u2013 and respond|date=10 January 2017|website=BBC}}</ref> and might be able to emit airborne sounds similar to \"screaming\" when [[Stress (biology)|stressed]].

S.

They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the [[Katha Upanishad]] (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the \"[[chariot]]\" of the body, guided by the mind as \"chariot driver\".\n\nDepictions of the five traditional senses as [[allegory]] became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s. A typical example is [[G\u00e9rard de Lairesse]]'s ''Allegory of the Five Senses'' (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a [[convex mirror]], hearing is the [[cupid]]-like boy with a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.\n\nIn [[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Ayatana]] or \"sense-base\" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aesthesis]]\n* [[Apperception]]\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[\u0100yatana]] (sense bases in Theravada Buddhism)\n* [[Chemesthesis]]\n* [[Empiricism]]\n* [[Extrasensory Perception]]\n* [[Entoptic phenomenon]]\n* Increased sensitivity:\n** [[Supertaster]]\n** [[Hyperesthesia]]\n** [[Hyperacusis]]\n* [[Illusion]]s\n** [[Auditory illusion]]\n** [[Optical illusion]]\n** [[Touch illusion]]\n* [[intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]]\n* [[Multisensory integration]]\n* [[Phantom limb]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[\u1e62a\u1e0d\u0101yatana|Sa\u1e37\u0101yatana]] and [[Ayatana]] (the six senses as a concept in [[Buddhism]])\n* [[Sensation and perception psychology]]\n* [[Sense of direction]]\n* [[Sensitivity (human)]]\n* [[Sensorium]]\n* [[Sensory processing disorder]]\n* [[Sensus divinitatis]]\n* [[Synesthesia]] ([[Ideasthesia]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Senses}}\n{{Wikiversity|What is the sixth sense}}\n{{Commons category|Senses}}\n\n* The 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] ([http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2004/index.html announced] 4 October 2004) was won by [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda Buck]] for their work explaining olfaction, published first in a joint paper in 1991 that described the very large family of about one thousand genes for odorant receptors and how the receptors link to the brain.\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/32909/Sensing-or-feeling/ Answers to several questions related to senses and human feeling from curious kids]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070520084243/http://www.physpharm.fmd.uwo.ca/undergrad/sensesweb/ The Physiology of the Senses tutorial] 12 animated chapters on vision, hearing, touch, balance and memory.\n\n{{Sensory system}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Perception]]\n[[Category:Senses| ]]\n[[Category:Sensory systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the cognitive process of sensation||}}\n{{short description|Physiological capacity of organisms that provides data for perception}}\n[[File:SensoryProcessing.png|alt=|thumb|440x440px|Sensation consists of signal collection and transduction]]\nThe physical process during which [[Sensory nervous system|sensory systems]] respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and provide [[data]] for [[perception]] is called '''sensation'''.<ref name=\"wol\" /> During sensation, sense organs engage in stimulus collection and [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]].<ref name=\"pri\">Privitera, A.

The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced. Listing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the major senses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality represents the sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sensation and perception of touch, which is known as somatosensation, can be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair movement, while the general sensation and perception of taste can be separated into submodalities of [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]], all of which are based on different chemicals binding to [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24|title=Anatomy and Physiology|publisher=Rice University (OpenStax)|date=2016-02-26|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Receptors ===\n{{Main|Sensory receptor}}\nSensory receptors are the cells or structures that detect sensations. [[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the [[peripheral nervous system]]. During transduction, physical stimulus is converted into [[action potential]] by receptors and transmitted towards the [[central nervous system]] for processing.<ref name=\"mcb\" /> Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of [[Sensory neuron|receptor cells]]. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: [[Sensory neuron|cell type]], position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position in relation to stimuli they sense. Receptors can further be classified functionally on the basis of the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell [[membrane potential]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Structural receptor types ====\n\n===== Location =====\nOne way to classify receptors is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An [[Exteroception|exteroceptor]] is a receptor that is located near a stimulus of the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in the skin. An [[Interoception|interoceptor]] is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the [[aorta]] or [[carotid sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Cell type =====\nThe cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a [[neuron]] that has a [[free nerve ending]], with [[dendrite]]s embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in [[connective tissue]] that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specialized [[Sensory neuron|receptor cell]], which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus. The [[Nociceptor|pain]] and [[Thermoreceptor|temperature receptors]] in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings (1). Also located in the dermis of the skin are [[Pacinian corpuscle|lamellated corpuscles]], neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch (2). The cells in the retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor (3), a [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA [[transmembrane protein]] receptor is a protein in the [[cell membrane]] that mediates a physiological change in a neuron, most often through the opening of [[ion channel]]s or changes in the [[cell signaling]] processes. Transmembrane receptors are activated by chemicals called [[ligand]]s. For example, a molecule in food can serve as a ligand for taste receptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors, are sensitive to mechanical or thermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane, and can generate an [[action potential]] or a [[graded potential]] in the [[sensory neuron]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Functional receptor types ====\nA third classification of receptors is by how the receptor [[Transduction (physiology)|transduces]] stimuli into [[membrane potential]] changes. Stimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and [[macromolecule]]s that affect transmembrane receptor proteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the environment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from visible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other organisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of bees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReceptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. The different types of functional receptor cell types are [[mechanoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptor]]s ([[osmoreceptor]]), [[thermoreceptor]]s, and [[nociceptor]]s. Physical stimuli, such as pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a mechanoreceptor.  Photoreceptors convert light (visible [[electromagnetic radiation]]) into signals. Chemical stimuli can be interpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object's taste or smell, while osmoreceptors respond to a chemical solute concentrations of body fluids. Nociception (pain) interprets the presence of tissue damage, from sensory information from mechano-, chemo-, and thermoreceptors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of neural science|date=1991|publisher=Appleton & Lange|others=Kandel, Eric R., Schwartz, James H.

This process involves presenting stimuli of varying intensities to a subject in order to determine the level at which the subject can reliably detect stimulation in a given sense.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n==== Differential threshold ====\n{{Main|Differential threshold}}\nDifferential threshold or just noticeable difference (JDS) is the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli, or the smallest difference in stimuli that can be judged to be different from each other.<ref name=\"wol\" /> [[Weber's Law]] is an empirical law that states that the difference threshold is a constant fraction of the comparison stimulus.<ref name=\"wol\" /> According to Weber's Law, bigger stimuli require larger differences to be noticed.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n[[File:Power_exponents_and_Steven's_Power_Law.svg|thumb|Human power exponents and Steven&#x27;s Power Law]]\n[[Psychophysics#Magnitude estimation|Magnitude estimation]] is a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] method in which subjects assign perceived values of given stimuli. The relationship between stimulus intensity and perceptive intensity is described by [[Steven's power law]].<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Signal detection theory ===\n{{Main|Signal detection theory}}\nSignal detection theory quantifies the experience of the subject to the presentation of a stimulus in the presence of [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]. There is internal noise and there is external noise when it comes to signal detection. The internal noise originates from static in the nervous system. For example, an individual with closed eyes in a dark room still sees something - a blotchy pattern of grey with intermittent brighter flashes -, this is internal noise. External noise is the result of noise in the environment that can interfere with the detection of the stimulus of interest. Noise is only a problem if the magnitude of the noise is large enough to interfere with signal collection. The [[nervous system]] calculates a criterion, or an internal threshold, for the detection of a signal in the presence of noise. If a signal is judged to be above the criterion, thus the signal is differentiated from the noise, the signal is sensed and perceived. Errors in signal detection can potentially lead to [[false positives and false negatives]]. The sensory criterion might be shifted based on the importance of the detecting the signal. Shifting of the criterion may influence the likelihood of false positives and false negatives.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Private perceptive experience ===\n{{Main|Qualia}}\nSubjective visual and auditory experiences appear to be similar across humans subjects. The same cannot be said about taste. For example, there is a molecule called [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) that some humans experience as bitter, some as almost tasteless, while others experience it as somewhere between tasteless and bitter. There is a genetic basis for this difference between perception given the same sensory stimulus. This subjective difference in taste perception has implications for individuals' food preferences, and consequently, health.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory adaptation ===\n{{Main|Sensory adaptation}}\nWhen a stimulus is constant and unchanging, perceptual sensory adaptation occurs. During this process, the subject becomes less sensitive to the stimulus.<ref name=\"pri\" />\n\n=== Fourier analysis ===\n{{Main|Fourier analysis}}\nBiological auditory (hearing), vestibular and spatial, and visual systems (vision) appear to break down real-world complex stimuli into [[sine wave]] components, through the mathematical process called Fourier analysis. Many neurons have a strong preference for certain sine [[frequency]] components in contrast to others. The way that simpler sounds and images are [[Code|encoded]] during sensation can provide insight into how perception of real-world objects happens.<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n=== Sensory neuroscience and the biology of perception ===\n{{Main|Sensory neuroscience}}\nPerception occurs when [[nerve]]s that lead from the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory organs]] (e.g. eye) to the brain are stimulated, even if that stimulation is unrelated to the target signal of the sensory organ. For example, in the case of the eye, it does not matter whether light or something else stimulates the optic nerve, that stimulation will results in visual perception, even if there was no visual stimulus to begin with. (To prove this point to yourself (and if you are a human), close your eyes (preferably in a dark room) and press gently on the outside corner of one eye through the eyelid. You will see a visual spot toward the inside of your visual field, near your nose.)<ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Sensory nervous system ====\n{{Main|Sensory nervous system}}\nAll stimuli received by the [[Sensory neuron|receptors]] are [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] to an [[action potential]], which is carried along one or more afferent [[neuron]]<nowiki/>s towards a specific area ([[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]) of the [[brain]]. Just as different nerves are dedicated to sensory and motors tasks, different areas of the brain (cortices) are similarly dedicated to different [[Sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] tasks. More complex processing is accomplished across primary cortical regions that spread beyond the primary cortices. Every nerve, [[Sensory nerve|sensory]] or [[Motor nerve|motor]], has its own signal transmission speed. For example, nerves in the frog's legs have a 90&nbsp;ft/s (99&nbsp;km/h) signal transmission speed, while sensory nerves in humans, transmit sensory information at speeds between 165&nbsp;ft/s (181&nbsp;km/h) and 330&nbsp;ft/s (362&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"wol\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The [[human]] external sensory and perceptual system<ref name=\"wol\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n![[Stimulus (physiology)|Physical stimulus]]\n!Sensory organ\n![[Sensory receptor]]\n![[Sensory system]]\n![[Cranial nerves|Cranial nerve(s)]]\n![[Cerebral cortex]]\n!Primary associated [[Perception|perception(s]])\n!Name\n|-\n|[[Light]]\n|[[Human eye|Eyes]]\n|[[Photoreceptor cell|Photoreceptor]]\n|[[Visual system]]\n|[[Optic (II) nerve|Optic (II)]]\n|[[Visual cortex]]\n|[[Visual perception]]\n|[[Visual perception|Vision]]\n|-\n|[[Sound]]\n|[[Ear]]s\n|[[Mechanoreceptor]]\n|[[Auditory system]]\n|[[Vestibulocochlear nerve|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)]]\n|[[Auditory cortex]]\n|[[Auditory perception]]\n|[[Hearing|Hearing (audition)]]\n|-\n|[[Gravity]] and [[acceleration]]\n|[[Inner ear]]\n|Mechanoreceptor\n|[[Vestibular system]]\n|Vestibulocochlear (VIII)\n|[[Vestibular cortex]]\n|[[Equilibrioception]]\n|[[Balance (ability)|Balance (equilibrium)]] \n|-\n|[[Chemical substance]]\n|[[Human nose|Nose]]\n|[[Chemoreceptor]]\n|[[Olfactory system]]\n|[[Olfactory nerve|Olfactory (I)]]\n|[[Olfactory cortex]]\n|[[Olfactory perception]], Gustatory perception (taste or flavor)<ref>Small DM, Green BG.

(1946-2004).|title=Biology|date=cop. 2005|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-26984-5|oclc=904492777}}</ref> Human external sensation is based on the sensory organs of the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[Human ear|ears]], [[Human skin|skin]], [[vestibular system]], [[Human nose|nose]], and [[Human mouth|mouth]], which contribute, respectively, to the sensory [[perception]]s of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[hearing]], [[touch]], [[Equilibrioception|spatial orientation]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[Flavor|taste]]. Smell and taste are both responsible for identifying molecules and thus both are types of [[chemoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s. Both olfaction (smell) and gustation (taste) require the transduction of chemical stimuli into electrical potentials.<ref name=\"pri\" /><ref name=\"wol\" />\n\n==== Visual system (vision) ====\n{{Main|Visual system}}\nThe visual system, or sense of sight, is based on the transduction of light stimuli received through the eyes and contributes to [[visual perception]]. The visual system detects [[light]] on [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the [[retina]] of each eye that generates electrical [[Action potential|nerve impulses]] for the perception of varying colors and brightness. There are two types of photoreceptors: [[Rod cell|rods]] and [[Cone cell|cones]]. Rods are very sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors. Cones distinguish colors but are less sensitive to dim light.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the molecular level, visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell. A single unit of light is called a [[photon]], which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave. The [[energy]] of a photon is represented by its [[wavelength]], with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular [[color]]. Visible light is [[electromagnetic radiation]] with a wavelength between 380 and 720&nbsp;nm. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation longer than 720&nbsp;nm fall into the [[infrared]] range, whereas wavelengths shorter than 380&nbsp;nm fall into the [[ultraviolet]] range. Light with a wavelength of 380&nbsp;nm is [[blue]] whereas light with a wavelength of 720&nbsp;nm is dark [[red]]. All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe three types of cone [[opsin]]<nowiki/>s, being sensitive to different wavelengths of light, provide us with color vision. By comparing the activity of the three different cones, the brain can extract color information from visual stimuli. For example, a bright blue light that has a wavelength of approximately 450&nbsp;nm would activate the \u201cred\u201d cones minimally, the \u201cgreen\u201d cones marginally, and the \u201cblue\u201d cones predominantly. The relative activation of the three different cones is calculated by the brain, which perceives the color as blue. However, cones cannot react to low-intensity light, and rods do not sense the color of light. Therefore, our low-light vision is\u2014in essence\u2014in [[grayscale]]. In other words, in a dark room, everything appears as a shade of [[Grey|gray]]. If you think that you can see colors in the dark, it is most likely because your brain knows what color something is and is relying on that memory.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere is some disagreement as to whether the visual system consists of one, two, or thre submodalities. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two submodalities, given that different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} that [[stereopsis]], the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the [[visual cortex]] of the brain where patterns and objects in [[Real image|images]] are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.\n\nThe inability to see is called [[blindness]]. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from [[stroke]] ([[infarct]]s in the brain).  Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications. People who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as [[blindsight]]. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behavior to the stimulus.\n\nOn February 14, 2013 researchers developed a [[neural implant]] that gives [[rat]]s the ability to sense [[infrared]] light which for the first time provides [[living creatures]] with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.<ref>{{cite journal|date=14 February 2013|title=Implant gives rats sixth sense for infrared light|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-02/14/implant-gives-rats-sixth-sense-for-infrared-light|journal=Wired UK|access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n'''Visual Perception in Psychology'''\n\n''Main Article:'' [[Gestalt psychology]]\n\nAccording to Gestalt Psychology, people perceive the whole of something even if it is not there. The Gestalt\u2019s Law of Organization states that people have seven factors that help to group what is seen into patterns or groups: Common Fate, Similarity, Proximity, Closure, Symmetry, Continuity, and Past Experience.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kohler|first=Wolfgang|title=Gestalt Psychology: An Introduction to New Concepts in Modern Psychology|publisher=Liveright Publishing Corporation|year=1947|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe Law of Common fate says that objects are led along the smoothest path.

We may see 42 objects in a group, but we can also perceive three groups of two lines with seven objects in each line. <ref name=\":12\" />\n\nThe Law of Closure is the idea that we as humans still see a full picture even if there are gaps within that picture. There could be gaps or parts missing from a section of a shape, but we would still perceive the shape as whole.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\nThe Law of Symmetry refers to a person's preference to see symmetry around a central point. An example would be when we use parentheses in writing. We tend to perceive all of the words in the parentheses as one section instead of individual words within the parentheses.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\nThe Law of Continuity tells us that objects are grouped together by their elements and then perceived as a whole. This usually happens when we see overlapping objects.We will see the overlapping objects with no interruptions.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\nThe Law of Past Experience refers to the tendency humans have to categorize objects according to past experiences under certain circumstances. If two objects are usually perceived together or within close proximity of each other the Law of Past Experience is usually seen.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==== Auditory system (hearing) ====\n{{Main|Auditory system}}\nHearing, or audition, is the transduction of [[sound waves]] into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of the [[ear]]. The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricle]]. At the end of the [[auditory canal]] is the tympanic membrane, or [[Eardrum|ear drum]], which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the [[external ear]]. The [[middle ear]] consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the [[ossicles]]. The three ossicles are the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]], which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the [[inner ear]], where the sound waves will be [[Transduction (physiology)|transduced]] into a neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the [[pharynx]] through the [[Eustachian tube]], which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The tube is normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during [[swallowing]] or [[yawn]]ing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the [[inner ear]], which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000&nbsp;[[hertz]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing, Physics Factbook by Glenn Elert (ed)|date=|publisher=Hypertextbook.com|access-date=2014-04-05}}</ref> with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called [[deafness]] or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as [[Seismic communication|vibrations conducted through the body]] by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine the direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vicdeaf.com.au/files/editor_upload/File/Information%20Sheets/Deaf%20Culture%20and%20Communication%20-%20A%20Basic%20Guide.pdf|title=Deaf Culture and Communication: A Basic Guide|year=2010|work=Victorian Deaf Society}}</ref>\n\nStudies pertaining to Audition started to increase in number towards the latter end of the nineteenth century. During this time, many laboratories in the United States began to create new models, diagrams, and instruments that all pertained to the ear.  <ref>{{Cite document|title=Early Auditory Studies: Activities in the Psychology Laboratories of American Universities|year = 1975|hdl = 10088/2430|last1 = Davis|first1 = Audrey B.}}</ref>\n\nThere is a branch of Cognitive Psychology dedicated strictly to Audition. They call it Auditory Cognitive Psychology. The main point is to understand why humans are able to use sound in thinking outside of actually saying it. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BilfZayFmj4C&pg=PA251&dq=Psychology+and+audition#v=onepage|title=Audtition: Cognitive Psychology of Music|website=|isbn=9780262121989|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last1=Llin's|first1=Rodolfo R.|last2=Llin\u00e1s|first2=Rodolfo|last3=Churchland|first3=Patricia Smith|year=1996}}</ref>\n\nRelating to Auditory Cognitive Psychology is Psychoacoustics.

Somatosensation is the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch and interoception. The modalities of somatosensation include [[pressure]], [[vibration]], light touch, [[Tickling|tickle]], [[itch]], [[temperature]], [[pain]], [[kinesthesia]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Somatosensation]], also called [[tactition]]  (adjectival form: tactile) is a perception resulting from activation of neural [[Mechanoreceptor|receptors]], generally in the [[skin]] including [[hair follicle]]s, but also in the [[tongue]], [[throat]], and [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]]. A variety of [[pressure]] receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of [[itch]]ing caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord.<ref name=\"Sun Zhao 2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Sun YG, Zhao ZQ, Meng XL, Yin J, Liu XY, Chen ZF|date=September 2009|title=Cellular basis of itch sensation|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5947|pages=1531\u20134|bibcode=2009Sci...325.1531S|doi=10.1126/science.1174868|pmc=2786498|pmid=19661382}}</ref> The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile [[anesthesia]].  [[Paresthesia]] is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or [[numbness]] of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.\n\nTwo types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by [[free nerve ending]]s are pain and temperature. These two modalities use [[thermoreceptor]]<nowiki/>s and [[nociceptor]]s to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively. Temperature receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from [[body temperature]]. Some thermoreceptors are sensitive to just cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially damaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations. Stressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the sensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves [[capsaicin]], the active molecule in hot peppers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLow frequency vibrations are sensed by mechanoreceptors called [[Merkel cell]]s, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel cells are located in the [[stratum basale]] of the [[epidermis]]. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated ([[Pacinian corpuscle|Pacinian]]) corpuscles, which are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Light touch is transduced by the encapsulated endings known as tactile ([[Meissner corpuscle|Meissner]]) corpuscles. Follicles are also wrapped in a [[plexus]] of nerve endings known as the hair follicle plexus. These nerve endings detect the movement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an insect may be walking along the [[skin]]. Stretching of the skin is transduced by stretch receptors known as [[bulbous corpuscle]]s. Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini corpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in [[pit vipers]]. The [[Thermoreceptor|thermoceptors]] in the skin are quite different from the [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] thermoceptors in the brain ([[POAH|hypothalamus]]), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.\n\n==== Vestibular system (balance) ====\n{{Main|Vestibular system}}\n\nThe vestibular sense, or sense of balance (equilibrium), is the sense that contributes to the perception of balance (equilibrium), spatial orientation, direction, or acceleration ([[equilibrioception]]). Along with audition, the [[inner ear]] is responsible for encoding information about equilibrium. A similar [[mechanoreceptor]]\u2014a hair cell with [[Stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]]\u2014senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion. These cells are located within the [[Vestibule of the ear|vestibule]] of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[saccule]], whereas head movement is sensed by the [[semicircular canals]]. The neural signals generated in the [[vestibular ganglion]] are transmitted through the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] to the [[Brainstem|brain stem]] and [[cerebellum]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately 45 degrees relative to the [[sagittal plane]]. The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the vestibule, connects to an enlarged region known as the [[Ampullary cupula|ampulla]]. The ampulla contains the hair cells that respond to rotational movement, such as turning the head while saying \u201cno.\u201d The stereocilia of these hair cells extend into the [[Ampullary cupula|cupula]], a membrane that attaches to the top of the ampulla. As the head rotates in a plane parallel to the semicircular canal, the fluid lags, deflecting the cupula in the direction opposite to the head movement. The semicircular canals contain several ampullae, with some oriented horizontally and others oriented vertically. By comparing the relative movements of both the horizontal and vertical ampullae, the vestibular system can detect  the direction of most head movements within three-dimensional ([[Three-dimensional space|3D]]) space.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[vestibular nerve]] conducts information from sensory receptors in three [[Osseous ampullae|ampulla]] that sense motion of fluid in three [[semicircular canal]]s caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head.  The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and the [[saccule]], which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of [[otolith]]s (which are small crystals of [[calcium carbonate]]) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.\n\n==== Gustatory system (taste) ====\n{{Main|Gustatory system}}\nThe gustatory system or the sense of taste is the [[sensory system]] that is partially responsible for the [[perception]] of [[Flavor|taste (flavor)]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trivedi|first=Bijal P.|date=June 2012|title=Gustatory system: The finer points of taste|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7403|pages=S2\u2013S3|doi=10.1038/486s2a|pmid=22717400|bibcode=2012Natur.486S...2T|issn=0028-0836}}</ref>  A few recognized [[Stimulus modality|submodalities]] exist within taste: [[sweet]], [[Saltiness|salty]], [[sour]], [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]], and [[umami]]. Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste submodality for fats, or lipids.<ref name=\":0\" /> The sense of taste is often confused with the perception of flavor, which is the results of the [[multimodal integration]] of gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell) sensations.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, M. M. (Micah M.), editor. Wallace, Mark T., editor.|title=The neural bases of multisensory processes|isbn=978-1-4398-1219-8|oclc=759160178|date=2011-08-25}}</ref> \n[[File:Philippe_Mercier_-_The_Sense_of_Taste_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mercier - The Sense of Taste - Google Art Project]]\nWithin the structure of the [[lingual papillae]] are [[taste bud]]s that contain specialized gustatory receptor cells for the [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]] of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release [[neurotransmitter]]s based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate [[sensory neuron]]s in the [[Facial nerve|facial]], [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]], and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] [[cranial nerves]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSalty and sour taste submodalities are triggered by the [[cations]] [[Na\u207a|Na+]] and [[Hydrogen ion|H+]], respectively. The other taste modalities result from food molecules binding to a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein\u2013coupled receptor]]. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to [[depolarization]] of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of [[glucose]] (or [[sugar substitute]]s) dissolved in the [[saliva]]. Bitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein\u2013coupled receptors. The taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation of G protein\u2013coupled receptors by a specific molecule.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnce the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release [[neurotransmitter]]s onto the [[dendrite]]s of sensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component within the vagus nerve dedicated to the [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]]. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus nerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the [[pharynx]], which are more sensitive to [[Noxious stimulus|noxious stimuli]] such as bitterness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFlavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste.

[[Odor|Odor molecules]] possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what humans perceive as the molecule's smell.<ref name=\"Moonwalk\">{{cite web|url=http://sandwalk.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/sense-of-smell-olfactory-receptors.html|title=A Sense of Smell: Olfactory Receptors|date=2007-01-09|work=Sandwalk|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe olfactory receptor neurons are located in a small region within the [[Nasal cavity|superior nasal cavity]]. This region is referred to as the [[olfactory epithelium]] and contains [[Bipolar neuron|bipolar sensory neurons]]. Each olfactory sensory neuron has [[dendrite]]s that extend from the [[apical surface]] of the [[epithelium]] into the [[mucus]] lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the [[Human nose|nose]], they pass over the olfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to proteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The odorant\u2013protein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These receptors are G protein\u2013coupled, and will produce a graded [[membrane potential]] in the [[Olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory neurons]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n[[File:The_sense_of_smell_Philippe_Mercier.jpg|thumb|The sense of smell Bequest of [[Mrs E.G. Elgar]], 1945 [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].]]\nIn the [[Human brain|brain]], olfaction is processed by the [[olfactory cortex]]. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called [[anosmia]]. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect [[pheromone]]s.<ref name=\"LiveScience\">{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html|title=The Surprising Impact of Taste and Smell|work=LiveScience}}</ref> Loss of the sense of smell can result in food tasting bland. A person with an impaired sense of smell may require additional [[spice]] and [[seasoning]] levels for food to be tasted. Anosmia may also be related to some presentations of mild [[Depression (mood)|depression]], because the loss of enjoyment of food may lead to a general sense of despair. The ability of olfactory neurons to replace themselves decreases with age, leading to age-related anosmia. This explains why some elderly people salt their food more than younger people do.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCauses of Olfactory dysfunction can be caused by age, exposure to toxic chemicals, viral infections, epilepsy, some sort of neurodegenerative disease, head trauma, or as a result of another disorder. [5]\n\nAs studies in olfaction have continued, there has been a positive correlation to its dysfunction or degeneration and early signs of Alzheimers and sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease. Many patients don\u2019t notice the decline in smell before being tested. In Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Alzheimers, an olfactory deficit is present in 85 to 90% of the early onset cases. [5]There is evidence that the decline of this sense can precede the Alzheimers or Parkinson\u2019s Disease by a couple years. Although the deficit is present in these two diseases, as well as others, it is important to make note that the severity or magnitude vary with every disease. This has brought to light some suggestions that olfactory testing could be used in some cases to aid in differentiating many of the neurodegenerative diseases. [5]\n\nThose who were born without a sense of smell or have a damaged sense of smell usually complain about 1, or more, of 3 things. Our olfactory sense is also used as a warning against bad food. If the sense of smell is damaged or not there, it can lead to a person contracting food poisoning more often. Not having a sense of smell can also lead to damaged relationships or insecurities within the relationships because of the inability for the person to not smell body odor. Lastly, smell influences how food and drink taste. When the olfactory sense is damaged, the satisfaction from eating and drinking is not as prominent. \n\n=== Internal ===\n{{Main|Interoception}}\n\n==== Proprioception ====\n\n[[Proprioception]], the kinesthetic sense, provides the [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortex]] of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.<ref name=\"roblesdelatorre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-IEEE-MM-2006.pdf|title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments|work=International Society for Haptics|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Pain ====\n\n[[Nociception]] (physiological [[pain]]) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the [[anterior cingulate gyrus]] of the brain.<ref name=\"Fulbright 2001\">{{cite journal|authors=Fulbright RK, Troche CJ, Skudlarski P, Gore JC, Wexler BE|date=November 2001|title=Functional MR imaging of regional brain activation associated with the affective experience of pain|journal=AJR.

They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.\n\nBlind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as [[human echolocation]].\n\n==== Electroreception ====\n[[Electroreception]] (or electroception) is the ability to detect [[electric field]]s. Several species of fish, [[shark]]s, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]]. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social [[communication]]. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.\n\nThe only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the [[dolphin]] and [[monotreme]] orders.

Essentially, it allows these reptiles to \"see\" radiant heat at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[\u03bcm]] to a degree of accuracy such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes.<ref>(Kardong & Mackessy 1991)</ref> It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making.<ref>(Krochmal et al. 2004)</ref> The facial pit underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.<ref>(Pough et al. 1992)</ref> The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[Loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target [[Endotherm|endothermic]] prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision-making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.\n\nIn spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors \u2013 while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature-sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than a chemical reaction to light.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\">(Gracheva et al. 2010)</ref> This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original \"resting\" or \"inactive\" temperature.<ref name=\"Gracheva et al. 2010\" />\n\n==== Other ====\nPressure detection uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the [[gas bladder]] to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the [[weather fish]] and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder.\n\nCurrent detection is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of [[Vortex|vortices]], found in the [[lateral line]] of fish and aquatic forms of amphibians. The lateral line is also sensitive to low-frequency vibrations. The mechanoreceptors are [[hair cell]]s, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The receptors of the [[Electroception|electrical sense]] are modified hair cells of the lateral line system.\n\n[[Polarized light]] direction/detection is used by [[bees]] to orient themselves, especially on cloudy days. [[Cuttlefish]], some [[beetles]], and [[mantis shrimp]] can also perceive the polarization of light.  Most sighted humans can in fact learn to roughly detect large areas of polarization by an effect called [[Haidinger's brush]], however this is considered an [[entoptic phenomenon]] rather than a separate sense.\n\n[[Slit sensilla]]e of spiders detect mechanical strain in the exoskeleton, providing information on force and vibrations.\n\n== Plant sensation ==\nBy using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]].\n\nHowever, plants could perceive the world around them,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170109-plants-can-see-hear-and-smell-and-respond|title=Earth - Plants can see, hear and smell \u2013 and respond|date=10 January 2017|website=BBC}}</ref> and might be able to emit airborne sounds similar to \"screaming\" when [[Stress (biology)|stressed]].

S. Lewis}}</ref> This traditional concept of five senses is common today.\n\nThe traditional five senses are enumerated as the \"five material faculties\" (''{{IAST|pa\u00f1canna\u1e43 indriy\u0101na\u1e43 avakanti}}'') in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the [[Katha Upanishad]] (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the \"[[chariot]]\" of the body, guided by the mind as \"chariot driver\".\n\nDepictions of the five traditional senses as [[allegory]] became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] and [[Flemish Baroque painter]]s. A typical example is [[G\u00e9rard de Lairesse]]'s ''Allegory of the Five Senses'' (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a [[convex mirror]], hearing is the [[cupid]]-like boy with a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.\n\nIn [[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Ayatana]] or \"sense-base\" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aesthesis]]\n* [[Apperception]]\n* [[Attention]]\n* [[\u0100yatana]] (sense bases in Theravada Buddhism)\n* [[Chemesthesis]]\n* [[Empiricism]]\n* [[Extrasensory Perception]]\n* [[Entoptic phenomenon]]\n* Increased sensitivity:\n** [[Supertaster]]\n** [[Hyperesthesia]]\n** [[Hyperacusis]]\n* [[Illusion]]s\n** [[Auditory illusion]]\n** [[Optical illusion]]\n** [[Touch illusion]]\n* [[intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]]\n* [[Multisensory integration]]\n* [[Phantom limb]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[\u1e62a\u1e0d\u0101yatana|Sa\u1e37\u0101yatana]] and [[Ayatana]] (the six senses as a concept in [[Buddhism]])\n* [[Sensation and perception psychology]]\n* [[Sense of direction]]\n* [[Sensitivity (human)]]\n* [[Sensorium]]\n* [[Sensory processing disorder]]\n* [[Sensus divinitatis]]\n* [[Synesthesia]] ([[Ideasthesia]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|Senses}}\n{{Wikiversity|What is the sixth sense}}\n{{Commons category|Senses}}\n\n* The 2004 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] ([http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/2004/index.html announced] 4 October 2004) was won by [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda Buck]] for their work explaining olfaction, published first in a joint paper in 1991 that described the very large family of about one thousand genes for odorant receptors and how the receptors link to the brain.\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/32909/Sensing-or-feeling/ Answers to several questions related to senses and human feeling from curious kids]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070520084243/http://www.physpharm.fmd.uwo.ca/undergrad/sensesweb/ The Physiology of the Senses tutorial] 12 animated chapters on vision, hearing, touch, balance and memory.\n\n{{Sensory system}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Perception]]\n[[Category:Senses| ]]\n[[Category:Sensory systems]]\n", "name_user": "2601:343:280:6e40:c54f:f337:5a20:2147", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"}
