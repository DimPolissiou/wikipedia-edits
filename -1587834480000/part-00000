This came to the ear of Ala-ud-Din Khilji, who would not allow such an outrage to pass unpunished. Gathering a mighty force, therefore, he set out for Kusabhavanpur and took revenge by killing most of the Bhars by strategem adopted after a long drawn siege. Kusabhavanpur was reduced to ashes and the town of Sultanpur, so called from the rank of the victor, rose upon its ruins. This town was finally raised to the ground during the military operations connected with the reoccupation of the province in consequence of the inhabitants having been concerned in the murder of British officers at the outbreak of the freedom struggle of 1857.<ref name=\"sultanpurcity.com\"/>\nBefore annexation a military station and cantonment were established on the right bank of the river in a village then known as Girghit but more commonly called by officials Sultanpur or Chhaoni Sarkar and by the rustic population Kampu or the Cam.

It was filmed in 1979, and was released in Europe in 1980 and in the United States on April 3, 1981 through [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nBo Hooper (Lewis), a clown, finds himself unemployed when the circus where he works suddenly closes.  He winds up living with his sister ([[Susan Oliver]]), against the wishes of her husband Robert ([[Roger C. Carmel]]).  From there he goes from job to job, wreaking havoc along the way.  He finally finds some stability as a postal worker, until he finds out that his boss is his girlfriend's father.  The father hates all mail carriers because his daughter's ex-husband was one, so he tries to wreck Bo's life, but Bo overcomes the odds and succeeds not only at work, but at impressing the father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jerry Lewis]] as Bo Hooper\n* [[Susan Oliver]] as Claire Trent\n* [[Roger C.

Established in 1869 as the College of Sciences, the College of Biological Sciences is now located on both the [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] Campus and the [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Campus. CBS is a college that focuses its undergraduate and graduate attention towards research. The dean is [[Valery E. Forbes]]. The Associate Dean for Graduate Education is Carrie Wilmot, the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education is John Ward, the Associate Dean for Research is David Greenstein, and the Associate Dean for Faculty is [[Marlene Zuk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=College Leadership|url=https://cbs.umn.edu/about/college-leadership|website=College of Biological Science|accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Institution==\n\n[[Image:Molecular cellular biology building.jpg|thumb|right|Molecular Cellular Biology Building East Bank]]\n\nThe College of Biological Sciences at the University of Minnesota is one of the few colleges nationwide devoted to biological sciences. CBS explores a world of opportunities, from molecules to ecosystems, to improve human health, develop renewable resources, enhance agriculture, and restore the environment. College of Biological Science undergraduates are among the most qualified at the University of Minnesota. The 2008 incoming freshman class, on average, had the highest class rank and ACT scores of any college within the university system.<ref>http://admissions.tc.umn.edu/academics/profile.html</ref>\n\nThere were 1,789 undergraduates registered for fall 2006 and 82 percent graduated in the top 15 percent of their high school class. There were a total of 377 freshmen and 135 faculty members many of which are known for their excellence with 4 of them being in the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nCBS Faculty conduct basic research on a range of applications in human health, agriculture, biotechnology and environmental sciences.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1887, the Animal Science Department was established in the College of Science, Letters, and Arts. In 1927, it was renamed Zoology. Then in 1891, the Botany Department was created. Eight years later, Lake Itasca Forestry and Biological Station was established with a forestry training program. It is now the site for the \"Nature of Life\" program CBS students must attend for 4 days in the summer before their freshman year. Then the Agricultural Biochemistry Department was formed within the Institute of Agriculture. In 1928, Snyder Hall, named for agricultural scientist Harry Snyder, was built to house Agricultural Biochemistry. Snyder Hall is now the headquarters for CBS, located on the St. Paul campus. In 1973, the Biological Sciences Center was built to house the Botany department and the Genetics and Cell Biology Department.<ref name=\"cbs\">[http://www.cbs.umn.edu University of Minnesota, College of Biological Sciences]</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Ecology Building was constructed on the St. Paul campus. Two years later, administration of the Bell Museum was transferred to the College of Natural Resources. In 1998, Dean Robert Elde led a university-wide reorganization to consolidate and realign departments in order to strengthen biological sciences and raise the university\u2019s national standing. The College of Biological Sciences\u2019 (CBS) current structure grew out of that effort.<ref name=\"cbs\"/>\n\nIn 2001, ''Biodale'' opened, offering biological research support services to faculty, students, and industry. It is currently one of the most used resource on campus. Then in 2004, University Enterprise Laboratories, Inc. was dedicated. Founding sponsors included [[Xcel Energy]], the City of St. Paul, the [[University of Minnesota]], [[3M]], [[Medtronic]], [[Dorsey & Whitney]], Surmodics, [[Guidant]], [[Boston Scientific]], and [[Ecolab]].<ref>*\"A Smart Start For Bioscience\", ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'', October 10, 2004:sec. B10</ref>\n\n===Structures===\n\nAdministrative offices for the College of Biological Sciences are located in Snyder Hall, at 1475 Gortner Avenue on the St. Paul campus. These include the Dean's Office, Communications, and Alumni Relations. Student services are located in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Building at 420 Washington Avenue SE on the East Bank campus. The departments of Plant and Microbial Biology and Ecology, Evolution and Behavior are in adjacent buildings. The Cargill Building for Microbial and Plant Genomics is across the street. The Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics is located in Jackson Hall on the Minneapolis campus, and the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development is in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Building on the Minneapolis Campus.\n\nThe Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics and the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development are shared with the [[University of Minnesota Medical School]]. The Department of Plant and Microbial Biology is shared with the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS). The Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior remains exclusive to CBS with close ties to CFANS, which administers the [[Bell Museum of Natural History|Bell Museum]] of Natural History. The Department of Neuroscience and the Department of Microbiology\u2014both part of the Medical School\u2014are affiliated with CBS. The BioTechnology Institute is a joint effort of CBS and the Institute of Technology. CBS also operates two field stations\u2014Cedar Creek Natural History Area, the birthplace of the modern science of [[ecosystem ecology]], and [[Itasca State Park|Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories]], used for education programs, field research, and public outreach.\n\n==Research facilities and fields==\n\nThe College of Biological Sciences shares several research, education and outreach facilities.\n\nBiodale, CBS\u2019 one-stop shop for research support services, houses $40 million in bioscience research equipment that is available to faculty and industry scientists.<ref name=\"cbs\"/>\n\nThe Cargill Building for Microbial and Plant Genomics provides a hub for genomics researchers university-wide. Faculty conduct basic research in functional genomics of microbes and crop plants to identify innovative ways to make crops more resistant to disease and drought, clean up the environment, and improve human health.\n\nThe Molecular and Cellular Biology Building opened in 2002 on the Minneapolis campus and houses classrooms and labs. It is home to the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics and the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development.\n\n[[Image:Mississippi headwaters.jpg|thumb|right|Headwaters of the Mississippi near Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories on Lake Itasca]]\n\nUniversity Enterprise Laboratories (UEL) is a non-profit entity that provides lab space for biotech start-up companies. Sponsors include [[Xcel Energy]], [[3M]], [[Allina Hospitals & Clinics|Allina]], Medtronic, [[Boston Scientific]], [[Dorsey & Whitney]], [[Ecolab]], [[Guidant|Guidant Corporation]], and Surmodics.\n\n[[Itasca State Park|Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories]] established in 1909, houses many  buildings for research as well as the summer portion of the freshman program, \"Nature of Life\" which all incoming CBS freshman must attend before entering their first year at the university. This portion of Nature of Life prepares students for the upcoming year and gives them an idea of one of the research facilities provided by CBS and the university.  The program continues for the next 4 semesters, during which each enrolled CBS freshman is expected to fully immerse themselves into CBS and university wide events and communities.<ref>\"The Wildest Classroom in Minnesota, Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories, http://cbs.umn.edu/itasca/</ref>\n\nOther research facilities include [[Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve]], the Ecology Building, Plant Growth Facilities, and Snyder Hall/Gortner Laboratories/Biological Sciences Center complex.\n\n==Notable faculty and staff==\nIn 1995, [[Edward B. Lewis]] (B.S. '39) received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for discovery of the collinearity principle in fruit flies, which revealed that the linear arrangement of genes on a [[chromosome]] corresponds to the development of [[body segment]]s. The finding was later confirmed in humans.\n\nThen in 1997, [[Paul D. Boyer]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for discovering how cells make [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Boyer was on the faculty of the biochemistry department from 1945-1957.\n\n[[G. David Tilman]] is the current director of [[Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve]] and member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].

Established in 1869 as the College of Sciences, the College of Biological Sciences is now located on both the [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] Campus and the [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Campus. CBS is a college that focuses its undergraduate and graduate attention towards research. The dean is [[Valery E. Forbes]]. The Associate Dean for Graduate Education is Carrie Wilmot, the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education is John Ward, the Associate Dean for Research is David Greenstein, and the Associate Dean for Faculty is [[Marlene Zuk]].<ref>{{cite web|title=College Leadership|url=https://cbs.umn.edu/about/college-leadership|website=College of Biological Science|accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Institution==\n\n[[Image:Molecular cellular biology building.jpg|thumb|right|Molecular Cellular Biology Building East Bank]]\n\nThe College of Biological Sciences at the University of Minnesota is one of the few colleges nationwide devoted to biological sciences. CBS explores a world of opportunities, from molecules to ecosystems, to improve human health, develop renewable resources, enhance agriculture, and restore the environment. College of Biological Science undergraduates are among the most qualified at the University of Minnesota. The 2008 incoming freshman class, on average, had the highest class rank and ACT scores of any college within the university system.<ref>http://admissions.tc.umn.edu/academics/profile.html</ref>\n\nThere were 1,789 undergraduates registered for fall 2006 and 82 percent graduated in the top 15 percent of their high school class. There were a total of 377 freshmen and 135 faculty members many of which are known for their excellence with 4 of them being in the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nCBS Faculty conduct basic research on a range of applications in human health, agriculture, biotechnology and environmental sciences.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1887, the Animal Science Department was established in the College of Science, Letters, and Arts. In 1927, it was renamed Zoology. Then in 1891, the Botany Department was created. Eight years later, Lake Itasca Forestry and Biological Station was established with a forestry training program. It is now the site for the \"Nature of Life\" program CBS students must attend for 4 days in the summer before their freshman year. Then the Agricultural Biochemistry Department was formed within the Institute of Agriculture. In 1928, Snyder Hall, named for agricultural scientist Harry Snyder, was built to house Agricultural Biochemistry. Snyder Hall is now the headquarters for CBS, located on the St. Paul campus. In 1973, the Biological Sciences Center was built to house the Botany department and the Genetics and Cell Biology Department.<ref name=\"cbs\">[http://www.cbs.umn.edu University of Minnesota, College of Biological Sciences]</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the Ecology Building was constructed on the St. Paul campus. Two years later, administration of the Bell Museum was transferred to the College of Natural Resources. In 1998, Dean Robert Elde led a university-wide reorganization to consolidate and realign departments in order to strengthen biological sciences and raise the university\u2019s national standing. The College of Biological Sciences\u2019 (CBS) current structure grew out of that effort.<ref name=\"cbs\"/>\n\nIn 2001, ''Biodale'' opened, offering biological research support services to faculty, students, and industry. It is currently one of the most used resource on campus. Then in 2004, University Enterprise Laboratories, Inc. was dedicated. Founding sponsors included [[Xcel Energy]], the City of St. Paul, the [[University of Minnesota]], [[3M]], [[Medtronic]], [[Dorsey & Whitney]], Surmodics, [[Guidant]], [[Boston Scientific]], and [[Ecolab]].<ref>*\"A Smart Start For Bioscience\", ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'', October 10, 2004:sec. B10</ref>\n\n===Structures===\n\nAdministrative offices for the College of Biological Sciences are located in Snyder Hall, at 1475 Gortner Avenue on the St. Paul campus. These include the Dean's Office, Communications, and Alumni Relations. Student services are located in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Building at 420 Washington Avenue SE on the East Bank campus. The departments of Plant and Microbial Biology and Ecology, Evolution and Behavior are in adjacent buildings. The Cargill Building for Microbial and Plant Genomics is across the street. The Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics is located in Jackson Hall on the Minneapolis campus, and the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development is in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Building on the Minneapolis Campus.\n\nThe Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics and the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development are shared with the [[University of Minnesota Medical School]]. The Department of Plant and Microbial Biology is shared with the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS). The Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior remains exclusive to CBS with close ties to CFANS, which administers the [[Bell Museum of Natural History|Bell Museum]] of Natural History. The Department of Neuroscience and the Department of Microbiology\u2014both part of the Medical School\u2014are affiliated with CBS. The BioTechnology Institute is a joint effort of CBS and the Institute of Technology. CBS also operates two field stations\u2014Cedar Creek Natural History Area, the birthplace of the modern science of [[ecosystem ecology]], and [[Itasca State Park|Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories]], used for education programs, field research, and public outreach.\n\n==Research facilities and fields==\n\nThe College of Biological Sciences shares several research, education and outreach facilities.\n\nBiodale, CBS\u2019 one-stop shop for research support services, houses $40 million in bioscience research equipment that is available to faculty and industry scientists.<ref name=\"cbs\"/>\n\nThe Cargill Building for Microbial and Plant Genomics provides a hub for genomics researchers university-wide. Faculty conduct basic research in functional genomics of microbes and crop plants to identify innovative ways to make crops more resistant to disease and drought, clean up the environment, and improve human health.\n\nThe Molecular and Cellular Biology Building opened in 2002 on the Minneapolis campus and houses classrooms and labs. It is home to the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics and the Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development.\n\n[[Image:Mississippi headwaters.jpg|thumb|right|Headwaters of the Mississippi near Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories on Lake Itasca]]\n\nUniversity Enterprise Laboratories (UEL) is a non-profit entity that provides lab space for biotech start-up companies. Sponsors include [[Xcel Energy]], [[3M]], [[Allina Hospitals & Clinics|Allina]], Medtronic, [[Boston Scientific]], [[Dorsey & Whitney]], [[Ecolab]], [[Guidant|Guidant Corporation]], and Surmodics.\n\n[[Itasca State Park|Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories]] established in 1909, houses many  buildings for research as well as the summer portion of the freshman program, \"Nature of Life\" which all incoming CBS freshman must attend before entering their first year at the university. This portion of Nature of Life prepares students for the upcoming year and gives them an idea of one of the research facilities provided by CBS and the university.  The program continues for the next 4 semesters, during which each enrolled CBS freshman is expected to fully immerse themselves into CBS and university wide events and communities.<ref>\"The Wildest Classroom in Minnesota, Itasca Biological Station and Laboratories, http://cbs.umn.edu/itasca/</ref>\n\nOther research facilities include [[Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve]], the Ecology Building, Plant Growth Facilities, and Snyder Hall/Gortner Laboratories/Biological Sciences Center complex.\n\n==Notable faculty and staff==\nIn 1995, [[Edward B. Lewis]] (B.S. '39) received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for discovery of the collinearity principle in fruit flies, which revealed that the linear arrangement of genes on a [[chromosome]] corresponds to the development of [[body segment]]s. The finding was later confirmed in humans.\n\nThen in 1997, [[Paul D. Boyer]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for discovering how cells make [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Boyer was on the faculty of the biochemistry department from 1945-1957.\n\n[[G. David Tilman]] is the current director of [[Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve]] and member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].

McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court.

is an American politician serving as Kentucky's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States senator]] and as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court.

The failure occurs because the second bight sees the force of the standing part, but is held in place by the working part, which has no tension. When capsizing, tension on the standing part pulls the second bight through the first bight. This drags the slip-tuck through, and will release the hitch if the third bight isn't long enough.\n \nAlternatives to the highwayman's hitch have been devised to mitigate collapse when tied around large objects.\n\n==Alternatives==\nOne simple improvement is to repeat the second and third bights i.e. one more bight of the standing part and then one more bight of the working part, each successively locking the previous bight; this has the disadvantage of requiring longer rope from both parts.\n\nAnother technique is to twist each bight before reaching through it for the next locking byte; the disadvantage here is the difficulty of tightening afterwards.\n\nIn his book Outdoor Knots, Clyde Soles presents one of Dan Lehman's revisions to the highwayman's hitch that is simple and effective, naming it the \"slip-free hitch\".<ref name=\"outdoor knots\">{{cite book|last1=Soles|first1=Clyde|title=The outdoor knots book : hikers, campers, climbers, kayakers|date=2004|publisher=Mountaineers Books|location=Seattle (WA)|isbn=9780898869620|edition=1st|pages=143\u2013144}}</ref>  One simply rearranges the trio of bights so that the heavily loaded bight in the standing part will surround, rather than go through, the next-made bight; the finishing slipped-tuck bight will thus go through the 2nd-made bight, and so be less severely loaded.  As the frame against which this rope toggle is nipped is entirely parts of the knot (and not depending upon proximity to the hitched object), this revision avoids the capsizing vulnerability of the highwayman's hitch.\n\nThe Notable Knot Index recommends the [[tumble hitch]] as a more stable hitch.  It's a similar hitch, but less prone to capsizing because the main part remains passive and the locking is done by two successive bights of the working part (no end needed) wrapping around both the standing part and the post/pole before locking the previous bight.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=Notable Knot Index|url=http://notableknotindex.webs.com/tumblehitch.html|title=The Tumble Hitch|accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of knots]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://gumroad.com/l/RgaLM cheap highwayman's knot 3d model]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Knots}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Highwayman's Hitch}}\n[[Category:Hitch knots]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox knot\n| name = Highwayman's hitch\n| names = Highwayman's hitch, draw hitch, Highwayman\u2019s cutaway, Bank Robbers Knot, Getaway hitch or Quick-release knot\n| image = Highwayman's Hitch.jpg\n| caption = A Highwayman's hitch tied around a wooden pole\n| type = hitch\n| type2 =\n| strength = \n| origin = \n| related = [[Tumble hitch]], Mooring Hitch\n| releasing = Non-jamming\n| uses = Quick-release, draw loop hitch\n| caveat = Potentially unstable, especially when tied around large objects\n| abok_number = \n| conway_notation = \n| ab_notation = \n}}\n\nThe '''Highwayman\u2019s hitch''' is a quick-release draw [[List of hitch knots|hitch]] used for temporarily securing a load that will need to be released easily and cleanly.<ref name=\"budcomp\">{{Citation|first=Geoffrey|last=Budworth|title=The Complete Book of Knots|location=London|publisher=Octopus|year=1997|page=73}}</ref>  The hitch can be untied with a tug of the working end, even when under tension.

This drags the slip-tuck through, and will release the hitch if the third bight isn't long enough.\n \nAlternatives to the highwayman's hitch have been devised to mitigate collapse when tied around large objects.\n\n==Alternatives==\nOne simple improvement is to repeat the second and third bights i.e. one more bight of the standing part and then one more bight of the working part, each successively locking the previous bight; this has the disadvantage of requiring longer rope from both parts.\n\nAnother technique is to twist each bight before reaching through it for the next locking byte; the disadvantage here is the difficulty of tightening afterwards.\n\nIn his book Outdoor Knots, Clyde Soles presents one of Dan Lehman's revisions to the highwayman's hitch that is simple and effective, naming it the \"slip-free hitch\".<ref name=\"outdoor knots\">{{cite book|last1=Soles|first1=Clyde|title=The outdoor knots book : hikers, campers, climbers, kayakers|date=2004|publisher=Mountaineers Books|location=Seattle (WA)|isbn=9780898869620|edition=1st|pages=143\u2013144}}</ref>  One simply rearranges the trio of bights so that the heavily loaded bight in the standing part will surround, rather than go through, the next-made bight; the finishing slipped-tuck bight will thus go through the 2nd-made bight, and so be less severely loaded.  As the frame against which this rope toggle is nipped is entirely parts of the knot (and not depending upon proximity to the hitched object), this revision avoids the capsizing vulnerability of the highwayman's hitch.\n\nThe Notable Knot Index recommends the [[tumble hitch]] as a more stable hitch.  It's a similar hitch, but less prone to capsizing because the main part remains passive and the locking is done by two successive bights of the working part (no end needed) wrapping around both the standing part and the post/pole before locking the previous bight.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=Notable Knot Index|url=http://notableknotindex.webs.com/tumblehitch.html|title=The Tumble Hitch|accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of knots]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Knots}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Highwayman's Hitch}}\n[[Category:Hitch knots]]\n", "name_user": "Zaripov999", "label": "safe", "comment": "add external link to 3d model", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwayman%27s_hitch"}

For example, from the earliest days of English colonial schemes, new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and [[English Poor Laws#A new colonial solution|the poor]] as well as to increase the colonial labour force,<ref name=DigitalPanopticon /> for the overall benefit of the realm.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp403-406 August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth], Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660.

(1908)</ref> and later under [[English Law]], transportation was an alternative sentence imposed for a [[felony]]. It was typically imposed for offences for which [[capital punishment|death]] was deemed too severe. By 1670, as new felonies were defined, the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed.<ref>Egerton, Hugh Edward,[https://archive.org/stream/ashorthistorybr01egergoog#page/n60/mode/2up A short history of British colonial policy], p.40 (1897)</ref><ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p709 Charles II, 1670 & 1671: An Act to prevent the malitious burning of Houses, Stackes of Corne and Hay and killing or maiming of Catle.]</ref> Forgery of a document, for example, was a capital crime until the 1820s, when the penalty was reduced to transportation. Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed for a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving his time, but had to make his own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.\n\nEngland transported its convicts and political prisoners, as well as prisoners of war from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], to [[British America|its overseas colonies in the Americas]] from the 1610s until early in the [[American Revolution]] in 1776, when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c. 43).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B09RAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA262&#v=onepage&q&f=false \"An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"]</ref> The practice was mandated in Scotland by an act of 1785, but was less used there than in England. Transportation on a large scale resumed with the departure of the [[First Fleet]] to [[Australia]] in 1787, and continued there [[History of Australia#Colonisation|until 1868]].\n\nTransportation was not used by Scotland before the [[Act of Union 1707]]; following union, the [[Transportation Act 1717]] specifically excluded its use in Scotland.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge54britgoog#page/n504/mode/2up Transportation Act 1717], Section 8, p.475</ref> Under the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3 c. 46) the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] specifically extended the usage of transportation to Scotland.<ref name=\"archive.org\">[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge23unkngoog#page/n206/mode/2up \"An act for the effectual transportation of felons, and other offenders, in that part of Great Britain called Scotland, and to authorize the removal of prisoners in certain places.\"]</ref> It remained little used<ref>{{citation |title=Scottish Criminals and Transportation to Australia 1786\u20131852 |first=Ian |last=Donnachie |journal=Journal Scottish Economic and Social History |year=1984|doi=10.3366/sesh.1984.4.4.21 }}</ref> under Scots Law until the early 19th century.\n\nIn Australia, a convict who had served part of his time might apply for a [[Ticket of leave#Australia|ticket of leave]], permitting some prescribed [[Freedom (political)|freedoms]]. This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life, to marry and raise a family, and to contribute to the development of the colony.\n\n===Historical background===\n====The trend towards more flexibility of sentencing====\n[[File:Convict ship Neptune00.jpg|thumb|[[Neptune (1780 ship)|The Neptune]], a 19th-century [[convict ship]] that brought prisoners to Australia]]\nIn England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe, later termed the [[Bloody Code]]. This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals. With modifications to the traditional [[Benefit of clergy]], which originally exempted only clergymen from civil law, it developed into a [[legal fiction]] by which many common offenders of \"clergyable\" offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 470</ref> Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the [[rule of law]], it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 472</ref> Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 473</ref> There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of [[James VI and I|James I]], a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners \"for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas\".<ref>Acts of the Privy Council (Colonial), vol. I, pp. 310, 314-15</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Cromwell overcame the popular prejudice against subjecting Christians to slavery or selling them into foreign parts, and initiated group transportation of military<ref>Cunningham. Growth of Eng. Industry and Com. in Mod. Times; 109, Cambridge, 1892. Cited in Karl Frederick Geiser, [https://archive.org/stream/redemptionersind00geis/redemptionersind00geis_djvu.txt Redemptioners and indentured servants in the colony and commonwealth of Pennsylvania], Supplement to the [[Yale Review]], Vol. X, No. 2, August, 1901. \"There was a popular prejudice against subjecting Christians into slavery or selling them into foreign parts, but Cromwell did not draw any such distinctions. Not only did his agents systematically capture Irish youths and girls for export to the West Indies, but all the garrison who were not killed in the Drogheda Massacre were shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes.\"</ref> and civilian prisoners.<ref>30 July 1649 Act empowering the Lord Mayor, Justices of Gaol delivery for Newgate, to transport threescore prisoners convicted of Felony and other heinous crimes, unto the Summer Islands or other new English Plantations.</ref> With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it, started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720, with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after [[Human branding#Branding in Britain|branding the thumb]]. Alternatively, under the second act dealing with [[Moss-trooper]] brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge's discretion, were to be transported to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.581</ref> There were various influential agents of change: judges' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king's and Privy Council's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 471</ref>\n\nThe system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed.<ref>Beattie, 1986, pp. 471\u2013472</ref> Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the [[benefit of clergy]], was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 475</ref>\n\n====Transportation as a commercial transaction====\n[[File:Joseph Lycett - The residence of Edward Riley Esquire, Wooloomooloo, Near Sydney N. S. W. - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Lycett]], an artist transported for forging bank notes, ''The residence of Edward Riley Esquire, Wooloomooloo, Near Sydney N. S. W.'', 1825, hand-coloured [[aquatint]] and etching printed in dark blue ink. Australian print in the tradition of British decorative production.]]\nTransportation became a business: merchants chose from among the prisoners on the basis of the demand for labour and their likely profits. They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as [[indentured servant]]s. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk's fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\">Beattie, 1986, p. 479</ref> These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/>\n\nThe penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it;<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 480</ref> but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. [[King William's War]] (1688\u20131697) (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]) and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u201314) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crime<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 500</ref> and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1702\u201314) and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u201327), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\">Beattie, 1986, p. 502</ref>\n\n==== Transportation Act 1717 ====\nThere were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (5 Anne c. 6). This allowed judges to sentence \"clergyable\" offenders to a [[workhouse]] or a [[house of correction]].<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\"/> But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The [[Transportation Act 1717|Transportation Act]] was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\">Beattie, 1986, p. 503</ref>\n\nNon-capital convicts (clergyable [[felon]]s usually destined for branding on the thumb, and [[petty larceny]] convicts usually destined for public whipping)<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 428</ref> were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\"/> The bill was introduced by [[William Thompson (Ipswich MP)|William Thomson]], the [[Solicitor General]], who was \"the architect of the transportation policy\".<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 429</ref> Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 426</ref>\n\nOne reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted [[Jonathan Forward]], a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 430</ref> The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: he was paid \u00a33 (\u00a35 in 1727) for each prisoner transported overseas. The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the [[Home Counties]].<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 504</ref>\n\nThe \"Felons' Act\" (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 432</ref> The Act led to significant changes: both [[petty larceny|petty]] and [[grand larceny]] were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge's discretion.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 506</ref> In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 505</ref>\n\nIn a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\">Beattie, 2001, p. 435</ref><ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 439</ref> This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 447</ref>\n\n====Women and children====\nPenal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by gender and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, [[burglary]], and [[horse theft]] were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which [[benefit of clergy]] was not available for women until 1692.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 474</ref> Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies.\n\nAll these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/> Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 483</ref> Women were sent to the [[Leeward Islands]], the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 482</ref> In 1696 [[Jamaica]] refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; [[Barbados]] similarly accepted convicts but not \"women, children nor other infirm persons\".<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 481</ref>\n\nThanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\">Beattie, 2001, p. 444</ref> Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\"/> The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\"/>\n\n====The end of transportation====\nThe outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) halted transportation to America. Parliament claimed that \"the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America... is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course\"; they then passed \"An act to authorize... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"<ref name=\"BasAsylum\">Marilyn C.

Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3 c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3, c. 54).<ref>Drew D.

Although a concerted program of prison building ensued, the [[Short Titles Act 1896]] lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"ShTitl\">[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1896/act/14/enacted/en/print Short Titles Act 1896]</ref>\n\nThe system of criminal punishment by transportation, as it had developed over nearly 150 years, was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s, when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with [[penal labor|penal servitude]], and intended to punish. The Penal Servitude Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 99), long titled \"An Act to substitute, in certain Cases, other Punishment in lieu of Transportation,\"<ref name=\"ShTitl\"/> enacted that with judicial discretion, lesser felonies, those subject to transportation for less than 14 years, could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term. To provide confinement facilities, the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. c. 121), long titled \"An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation.\"<ref name=\"ShTitl\"/> The Penal Servitude Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict. c. 3) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases, with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1857/3/pdfs/ukpga_18570003_en.pdf Penal Servitude Act 1857]</ref><ref name=\"oldbaileyonline1\" /> While transport was greatly reduced following passage of the 1857 act, the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868.

[[Norfolk Island]] was a convict penal settlement from 1788\u201394, and again from 1824\u201347. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. In 1803, [[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]] (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the [[Queensland|Moreton Bay Settlement]] (Queensland) in 1824. The other [[States and territories of Australia|Australian colonies]] were \"free settlements\", as non-convict colonies were known.

Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed for a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving his time, but had to make his own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.\n\nEngland transported its convicts and political prisoners, as well as prisoners of war from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]], to [[British America|its overseas colonies in the Americas]] from the 1610s until early in the [[American Revolution]] in 1776, when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c. 43).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B09RAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA262&#v=onepage&q&f=false \"An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"]</ref> The practice was mandated in Scotland by an act of 1785, but was less used there than in England.

This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life, to marry and raise a family, and to contribute to the development of the colony.\n\n===Historical background===\n====The trend towards more flexibility of sentencing====\n[[File:Convict ship Neptune00.jpg|thumb|[[Neptune (1780 ship)|The Neptune]], a 19th-century [[convict ship]] that brought prisoners to Australia]]\nIn England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe, later termed the [[Bloody Code]]. This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals. With modifications to the traditional [[Benefit of clergy]], which originally exempted only clergymen from civil law, it developed into a [[legal fiction]] by which many common offenders of \"clergyable\" offenses were extended the privilege to avoid execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 470</ref> Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the [[rule of law]], it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 472</ref> Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king's mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 473</ref> There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of [[James VI and I|James I]], a committee of the Council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners \"for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas\".<ref>Acts of the Privy Council (Colonial), vol. I, pp. 310, 314-15</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Cromwell overcame the popular prejudice against subjecting Christians to slavery or selling them into foreign parts, and initiated group transportation of military<ref>Cunningham. Growth of Eng. Industry and Com. in Mod. Times; 109, Cambridge, 1892.

Not only did his agents systematically capture Irish youths and girls for export to the West Indies, but all the garrison who were not killed in the Drogheda Massacre were shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes.\"</ref> and civilian prisoners.<ref>30 July 1649 Act empowering the Lord Mayor, Justices of Gaol delivery for Newgate, to transport threescore prisoners convicted of Felony and other heinous crimes, unto the Summer Islands or other new English Plantations.</ref> With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it, started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720, with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after [[Human branding#Branding in Britain|branding the thumb]]. Alternatively, under the second act dealing with [[Moss-trooper]] brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge's discretion, were to be transported to America, \"there to remaine and not to returne\".<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol5/p598 Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80], p.598</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statutesatlarge20unkngoog#page/n587/mode/2up Statutes at Large, Volume 24, Index for acts passed before 1 Geo. 3] p.581</ref> There were various influential agents of change: judges' discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king's and Privy Council's opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 471</ref>\n\nThe system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed.<ref>Beattie, 1986, pp. 471\u2013472</ref> Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the [[benefit of clergy]], was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 475</ref>\n\n====Transportation as a commercial transaction====\n[[File:Joseph Lycett - The residence of Edward Riley Esquire, Wooloomooloo, Near Sydney N.

W.'', 1825, hand-coloured [[aquatint]] and etching printed in dark blue ink.

They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as [[indentured servant]]s. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk's fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\">Beattie, 1986, p. 479</ref> These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/>\n\nThe penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts' labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it;<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 480</ref> but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. [[King William's War]] (1688\u20131697) (part of the [[Nine Years' War]]) and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u201314) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crime<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 500</ref> and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (1702\u201314) and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u201327), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\">Beattie, 1986, p. 502</ref>\n\n==== Transportation Act 1717 ====\nThere were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (5 Anne c. 6). This allowed judges to sentence \"clergyable\" offenders to a [[workhouse]] or a [[house of correction]].<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 502\"/> But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The [[Transportation Act 1717|Transportation Act]] was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\">Beattie, 1986, p. 503</ref>\n\nNon-capital convicts (clergyable [[felon]]s usually destined for branding on the thumb, and [[petty larceny]] convicts usually destined for public whipping)<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 428</ref> were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 503\"/> The bill was introduced by [[William Thompson (Ipswich MP)|William Thomson]], the [[Solicitor General]], who was \"the architect of the transportation policy\".<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 429</ref> Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 426</ref>\n\nOne reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson's proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted [[Jonathan Forward]], a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 430</ref> The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: he was paid \u00a33 (\u00a35 in 1727) for each prisoner transported overseas. The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the [[Home Counties]].<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 504</ref>\n\nThe \"Felons' Act\" (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 432</ref> The Act led to significant changes: both [[petty larceny|petty]] and [[grand larceny]] were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge's discretion.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 506</ref> In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 505</ref>\n\nIn a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\">Beattie, 2001, p. 435</ref><ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 439</ref> This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.<ref>Beattie, 2001, p. 447</ref>\n\n====Women and children====\nPenal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by gender and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, [[burglary]], and [[horse theft]] were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which [[benefit of clergy]] was not available for women until 1692.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 474</ref> Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies.\n\nAll these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail.<ref name=\"Beattie, 1986, p. 479\"/> Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 483</ref> Women were sent to the [[Leeward Islands]], the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas.<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 482</ref> In 1696 [[Jamaica]] refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; [[Barbados]] similarly accepted convicts but not \"women, children nor other infirm persons\".<ref>Beattie, 1986, p. 481</ref>\n\nThanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\">Beattie, 2001, p. 444</ref> Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 444\"/> The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community.<ref name=\"Beattie, 2001, p. 435\"/>\n\n====The end of transportation====\nThe outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) halted transportation to America. Parliament claimed that \"the transportation of convicts to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in America... is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course\"; they then passed \"An act to authorize... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\"<ref name=\"BasAsylum\">Marilyn C. Baseler, [https://archive.org/details/asylumformankind00base/page/125 \"Asylum for Mankind\": America, 1607-1800], p.124-127</ref> For the ensuing decade, men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned. Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3 c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3, c. 54).<ref>Drew D.

[[Norfolk Island]] was a convict penal settlement from 1788\u201394, and again from 1824\u201347. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. In 1803, [[Tasmania|Van Diemen's Land]] (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the [[Queensland|Moreton Bay Settlement]] (Queensland) in 1824. The other [[States and territories of Australia|Australian colonies]] were \"free settlements\", as non-convict colonies were known. However, the [[Swan River Colony]] (Western Australia) accepted transportation from England and Ireland in 1851, to resolve a long-standing [[Labor shortage|labour shortage]]. Until the massive influx of immigrants during the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the 1850s, the free settlers had been outnumbered by English and Irish convicts and their descendants.
