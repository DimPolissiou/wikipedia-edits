The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]. The optically pure compound and intermediate '''a''' are reacted with trimethyl phosphate and methylimidazole to obtain a [[diastereomer]] mixture of remdesivir. In the end, optically pure remdesivir can be obtained through [[chiral resolution]] methods.\n\n==Access==\nOn 20 March 2020, President Trump announced that remdesivir was available for \"[[compassionate use]]\" by people with COVID-19; FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn confirmed the statement at the same press conference.<!--Apologies, but the following definition does not capture the definition provided at the corresponding Wikipedia article on the subject, and so creates unnecessary contradiction.

[[n-Butyllithium]] undergoes a [[Organolithium reagent|halogen-lithium exchange]] reaction with the bromide at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to yield the intermediate '''c'''. The intermediate '''b''' is then added to a solution containing intermediate '''c''' dropwise. After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 [[anomer]]s was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]].

These colors are not a result of [[pigmentation]], but are an example of [[iridescence]] through [[structural coloration]]. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho's wings [[reflection (physics)|reflect]] incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=P.

The wide-angle blue reflection property can be explained by exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings.<ref name=Siddique_Morpho_coloration>{{cite journal |last1=Siddique |first1=R.

The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90&nbsp;nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a [[photonic crystal]]. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of [[biomimetic]] fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.\n\nThe [[iridescent lamellae]] are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.\n\nThe ventral side is decorated with [[Eyespot (mimicry)|ocelli]] (eyespots). In some species, such as ''[[Morpho godarti|M. godarti]]'', the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any [[ultraviolet]]. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.\n\nAlso, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance ''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'' and ''[[Morpho telemachus|M. telemachus]]''). Some species are white, principal among these being ''[[Morpho catenarius|M. catenarius]]'' and ''[[Morpho laertes|M. laertes]]''. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning [[pearlescent]] purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare ''[[Morpho sulkowskyi|M. sulkowskyi]]''. Some Andean species are small and delicate (''[[Morpho lympharis|M. lympharis]]''). Among the metallic blue ''Morpho'' species, [[Morpho rhetenor|''M. rhetenor'']] stands out as the most iridescent of all, with [[Morpho cypris|''M. cypris'']] a close second. Indeed, ''M. cypris'' is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not 'set' perfectly flat. Many species, like [[M. cypris]] and [[M. rhetenor helena]] have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.<ref>[http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1560023&blobtype=pdf]</ref>\n\nCelebrated author and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described their appearance as \"shimmering light-blue mirrors\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Butterfly People|year=2013|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIz4oBi5xXAC|isbn=9780307907875}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nThe blue morpho species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species (for instance ''M.adonis'', ''M. eugenia'', ''M. aega'', ''M. cypris'', and ''M. rhetenor''), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are [[Camouflage|disruptively]] colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance ''M. anaxibia'', ''M. godarti'', ''M. didius'', ''M. amathonte'', and ''M. deidamia''), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Forest]] in Paraguay]]\n\n''Morpho'' butterflies inhabit the [[primary forest]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]]. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats &ndash; for instance, the dry [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] [[woodland]]s of [[Nicaragua]] and [[secondary forest]]s.\n''Morphos'' are found at [[altitude]]s between [[sea level]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Biology ==\n*''Morpho''s are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and chase any rivals. ''Morpho''s typically live alone, excluding in the mating season.\n*The genus ''Morpho'' is palatable, but some species (such as ''[[Morpho amathonte|M. amathonte]]'') are very strong fliers; birds\u2014even species which are specialized for catching butterflies on the wing\u2014find it very hard to catch them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Allen M. |year=1971 |title=Wing colouration and reflectance in ''Morpho'' butterflies as related to reproductive behaviour and escape from avian predators |journal=Oecologia |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=209\u2013222 |doi=10.1007/bf00345212|pmid=28311247 }}</ref> The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most ''Morpho'' species may be a case of [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]],<ref name=\"pinheiro\">{{cite journal |last1=Pinheiro |first1=Carlos E.

The iridescent wings are used in the manufacture of [[jewelry]] and as inlay in [[woodworking]]. Papered specimens are sold with the abdomen removed to prevent its oily contents from staining the wings. Significant quantities of live specimens are exported as pupae from several Neotropical countries for exhibition in butterfly houses. Unfortunately, due to their irregular flight pattern and size, their wings are frequently damaged when in captivity.\n\n== Host plants ==\n''Morpho'' larvae, variously according to species and region, feed on [[Leguminosae]], [[Gramineae]], [[Canellaceae]], [[Guttiferae]], [[Erythroxylaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Moraceae]], [[Lauraceae]], [[Sapindaceae]], [[Rhamnaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]], [[Musaceae]], [[Palmae]], [[Menispermaceae]], [[Tiliaceae]], [[Bignoniaceae]], and [[Menispermaceae]].\n\nAccording to Penz and DeVries<ref name=\"Penz, C.M. & P.J.

Famous collections include those of the London jeweler [[Dru Drury]] and the Dutch merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], the Paris diplomat [[Georges Rousseau-Decelle]], the financier [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], the Romanov [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] and the, English and German respectively, businessmen [[James John Joicey]] and [[Curt Eisner]]. In earlier years, ''Morphos'' graced [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] \"''Kunstkamera''\" and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia [[Peter the Great]], the Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden]]. More famous is [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], who was not wealthy.\n\nThe people along the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in [[Brazil]] once exploited the territorial habits of the blue morpho (''[[Morpho menelaus|M. menelaus]]'') by luring them into clearings with bright blue decoys. The collected butterfly wings were used as embellishment for ceremonial masks. Adult morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured.

These colors are not a result of [[pigmentation]], but are an example of [[iridescence]] through [[structural coloration]]. Specifically, the microscopic scales covering the morpho's wings [[reflection (physics)|reflect]] incident light repeatedly at successive layers, leading to [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that depend on both wavelength and angle of incidence/observance.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=P.

The wide-angle blue reflection property can be explained by exploring the nanostructures in the scales of the morpho butterfly wings.<ref name=Siddique_Morpho_coloration>{{cite journal |last1=Siddique |first1=R.

The reflection spectrum is found to be broad (about 90&nbsp;nm) for alternating layers and can be controlled by varying the design pattern. The Christmas tree-like pattern helps to reduce the directionality of the reflectance by creating an impedance matching for blue wavelengths. In addition, the height offset between neighboring ridges increases the intensity of reflection for a wide range of angles. This structure may be likened to a [[photonic crystal]]. The lamellate structure of their wing scales has been studied as a model in the development of [[biomimetic]] fabrics, dye-free paints, and anticounterfeit technology used in currency.\n\nThe [[iridescent lamellae]] are only present on the dorsal sides of their wings, leaving the ventral sides brown.\n\nThe ventral side is decorated with [[Eyespot (mimicry)|ocelli]] (eyespots). In some species, such as ''[[Morpho godarti|M. godarti]]'', the dorsal lamellae are so thin that ventral ocelli can peek through. While not all morphos have iridescent coloration, they all have ocelli. In most species, only the males are colorful, supporting the theory that the coloration is used for intrasexual communication between males. The lamellae reflect up to 70% of light falling on them, including any [[ultraviolet]]. The eyes of morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light, so the males are able to see each other from great distances. Some South American species are reportedly visible to the human eye up to one kilometer away.\n\nAlso, a number of other species exist which are tawny orange or dark brown (for instance ''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'' and ''[[Morpho telemachus|M. telemachus]]''). Some species are white, principal among these being ''[[Morpho catenarius|M. catenarius]]'' and ''[[Morpho laertes|M. laertes]]''. An unusual species, fundamentally white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning [[pearlescent]] purple and teal iridescence when viewed at certain angles, is the rare ''[[Morpho sulkowskyi|M. sulkowskyi]]''. Some Andean species are small and delicate (''[[Morpho lympharis|M. lympharis]]''). Among the metallic blue ''Morpho'' species, [[Morpho rhetenor|''M. rhetenor'']] stands out as the most iridescent of all, with [[Morpho cypris|''M. cypris'']] a close second. Indeed, ''M. cypris'' is notable in that specimens mounted in entomological collections exhibit color differences across the wings if they are not 'set' perfectly flat. Many species, like [[M. cypris]] and [[M. rhetenor helena]] have a white stripe pattern on their colored blue wings as well.<ref>[http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1560023&blobtype=pdf]</ref>\n\nCelebrated author and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described their appearance as \"shimmering light-blue mirrors\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Butterfly People|year=2013|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=201|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIz4oBi5xXAC|isbn=9780307907875}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexual dimorphism ===\nThe blue morpho species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. In some species (for instance ''M.adonis'', ''M. eugenia'', ''M. aega'', ''M. cypris'', and ''M. rhetenor''), only the males are iridescent blue; the females are [[Camouflage|disruptively]] colored brown and yellow. In other species (for instance ''M. anaxibia'', ''M. godarti'', ''M. didius'', ''M. amathonte'', and ''M. deidamia''), the females are partially iridescent, but less blue than the males.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Atlantic Forest.jpg|thumb|[[Atlantic Forest]] in Paraguay]]\n\n''Morpho'' butterflies inhabit the [[primary forest]]s of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]]. They also adapted to breed in a wide variety of other forested habitats &ndash; for instance, the dry [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] [[woodland]]s of [[Nicaragua]] and [[secondary forest]]s.\n''Morphos'' are found at [[altitude]]s between [[sea level]] and about {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Biology ==\n*''Morpho''s are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], as males spend the mornings patrolling along the courses of forest streams and rivers.

Famous collections include those of the London jeweler [[Dru Drury]] and the Dutch merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], the Paris diplomat [[Georges Rousseau-Decelle]], the financier [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]], the Romanov [[Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich of Russia]] and the, English and German respectively, businessmen [[James John Joicey]] and [[Curt Eisner]]. In earlier years, ''Morphos'' graced [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] \"''Kunstkamera''\" and royal cabinets of natural history notably those of Tsar of Russia [[Peter the Great]], the Austrian empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden]]. More famous is [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], who was not wealthy.\n\nThe people along the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] in [[Brazil]] once exploited the territorial habits of the blue morpho (''[[Morpho menelaus|M. menelaus]]'') by luring them into clearings with bright blue decoys. The collected butterfly wings were used as embellishment for ceremonial masks. Adult morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured. The butterflies wobble in flight and are easy to catch.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Morpho didius Male Ventre MHNT.jpg|''M. didius'' \u2013 ventral side: Predatory birds aim their attack at the most prominent feature, the ocelli, missing the body entirely.\nFile:Bluemorphobutterfly.jpg|''[[Morpho peleides|M. peleides]]'', note the symmetric notches left by a bird beak\nFile:White Morpho wings closed.JPG|''[[Morpho polyphemus|M. polyphemus]]'', one of several \"white morpho\" species\nFile:Morpho rhetenor rhetenor MHNT dos.jpg|''[[Morpho rhetenor|M. rhetenor]]'' \u2013 this museum specimen is used for education, but thousands are killed for domestic displays, sold to tourists or in gift shops.\nFile:Morphobutterfly.jpg|''[[Morpho richardus|M. richardus]]'' sunning itself for warmth\nFile:Morpho hecuba hecuba MHNT dos.jpg|''[[Morpho hecuba|M. hecuba]]'', the largest morpho, with a wingspan of up to {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}}\nFile:MorphoherculesandMorphothamyrisSizecomparison.JPG|''M. hecuba'' size comparison with ''M. thamyris'' (''M. portis'')\nFile:Morpho butterfly with wings closed, Corcovado, Costa Rica, Dec 2014.jpg|The closed wings of this morpho butterfly are damaged, allowing some of the blue to show.\n</gallery>\n\n== Illustrations ==\n<gallery>\nFile:MorphoAchillesMerian.jpg|[[Maria Sibylla Merian]] ''Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium'' 1705\nFile:Cramer&Stoll-uitlandsche kapellen vol. 1- plate 027.jpg|[[Pieter Cramer]] and [[Caspar Stoll]] ''De Uitlandsche Kapellen'' 1775\u20131782\nFile:Cramer&Stoll-uitlandsche kapellen vol. 1- plate 028.jpg|Pieter Cramer and Caspar Stoll'' De Uitlandsche Kapellen'' 1775\u20131782\nFile:ShawNaturalists MiscellanyAchilles.jpg|[[George Shaw]] and [[Frederick Polydore Nodder]]''The Naturalist's Miscellany'' 1789\u20131813\nFile:Hubner1821SammlExotSchmett2Plate73.jpg| [[Jacob H\u00fcbner|H\u00fcbner]] ''Sammlung exotischer Schmetterlinge'' Augsburg [1806-1841]\nFile:LucasMorphomenelaus.jpg| [[Hippolyte Lucas]] ''Histoire Naturelle des Lepidopteres Exotiques'' Paris,1835.\nFile:NovaraExpZoologischeTheilLepidopteraAtlasTaf63.jpg|[[Baron Cajetan von Felder|Cajetan]] and [[Rudolf Felder]] ''Reise der \u00d6sterreichischen Fregatte Novara um die Erde in den Jahren 1857, 1858, 1859''\nFile:Biolcam.jpg|[[Frederick DuCane Godman]] and [[Osbert Salvin]] ''Biologia Centrali-Americana'' 1879\u20131915\nFile:SeitzFA2.jpg|[[Adalbert Seitz]] ''Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde'' 1860\u20131938\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregions]] (Neotropical)\n*[[Tropical Andes]]\n*''[[Arhopala]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Bilotta | first1 = I | year = 1992 | title = Morfologia comparada da cabe\u00e7a das especies sulbrasileiras de Morphinae (Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae) | url = | journal = Revista Brasileira de Zoologia | volume = 9 | issue = 3\u20134| pages = 261\u2013271 | doi=10.1590/s0101-81751992000200012| doi-access = free }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Bilotta | first1 = I | year = 1994 | title = Morfologia comparada do torax das especies sulbrasileiras de Morphinae (Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae) | url = | journal = Revista Brasileira de Zoologia | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 691\u2013713 | doi=10.1590/s0101-81751994000400014| doi-access = free }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Bilotta | first1 = I | year = 1994 | title = Morfologia comparada do abdome das especies sulbrasileiras de Morphinae(Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) | url = | journal = Revista Brasileira de Zoologia | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 737\u2013748 | doi=10.1590/s0101-81751994000400016| doi-access = free }}\n*Blandin, P.

Performed by Ulrich Metzner on a harpsichord of the type used in the early 20th century|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe '''''Fitzwilliam Virginal Book''''' is a primary source of keyboard music from the late [[Elizabethan]] and early [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods in [[England]], i.e., the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and very early [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. It takes its name from [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam|Viscount Fitzwilliam]] who bequeathed this manuscript collection to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1816. It is now deposited in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] at Cambridge.\nAlthough the word [[virginals]] or '''virginal''' (the plural form does not necessarily denote more than one instrument) is used today to refer to a specific instrument similar to a small, portable [[harpsichord]], at the time of the book the word was used to denote virtually any [[keyboard instrument]] including the [[organ (music)|organ]].\n==History==\nIt was given no title by its copyist and the ownership of the manuscript before the eighteenth century is unclear.\nAt the time the ''Fitzwilliam Virginal Book'' was put together most collections of keyboard music were compiled by performers: other examples include ''Will Forster's Virginal Book'', ''[[Clement Matchett's Virginal Book]]'', and ''[[Anne Cromwell's Virginal Book]]''. Until ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' was printed in about 1612, there was no keyboard music published as such in England, because of the technical complexity of printing keyboard music as opposed to, for example, vocal parts.\n\nIt was once called ''[[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth's]] Virginal Book'', a title that has been abandoned because it has been determined that she never owned it,\nAnother hypothesis, which still has supporters, is that it belonged to [[Francis Tregian the Younger]], a [[recusant]] and amateur musician. It has been argued that Tregian may have copied the entire collection while imprisoned in the period leading up to his death in 1618. The nature of Tregian's contribution to the book, if any, has been disputed.<ref>Ruby Reid Thompson, Francis Tregian the Younger as music copyist: A legend and an alternative view. Music and Letters 2001 82: 1-31; {{doi|10.1093/ml/82.1.1}}</ref> Recent scholarship suggests that even if Tregian is the compiler, it is unlikely that he was imprisoned long enough to do the copying involved.<ref>Kah-Ming Ng, liner notes to ''The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: Transcriptions for a Mixed Consort,'' charivari agr\u00e9able, Signum Records SIGD009</ref>\n\nIt includes music dating from approximately 1562 to 1612 by [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]], [[William Byrd]], [[Orlando Gibbons]], [[Giles Farnaby]] (51 of whose 52 known pieces are included), Martin Peerson, [[Peter Philips]] and [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]], as well as many others. There are 297 separate pieces (actually, 298: one piece is numbered, but is blank. Strangely, the Maitland Squire edition numbers No. 182 twice).  As with many keyboard manuscripts of the time, the pieces were not written for a specific instrument, and most sound happily on all contemporary keyboard instruments, including [[virginals]], [[harpsichord]], [[clavichord]] and [[chamber organ]].<ref>A few of the pieces presuppose an instrument arranged with a [[short octave]] in the bass, since they contain large intervals for the left hand that cannot be reached on the modern keyboard. The short octave was widely employed in all four instruments mentioned in the main text.</ref> Many of the pieces in the book are short, and many of them are character pieces with droll and memorable titles, including  \"Put Up Thy Dagger, Jemy\", \"The New Sa-Hoo\", and \"Quodlings Delight\" by [[Giles Farnaby]]; \"Nobody's Gigge\", by [[Richard Farnaby]]; \"Pakington's Pownde\" and \"The Irishe Dumpe\" (anonymous); \"The Ghost\" and \"The Earle of Oxford's Marche\" by [[William Byrd]]; \"Worster Braules\" by [[Thomas Tomkins]]; and the famous \"[[Lachrymae Pavan]]\" by [[John Dowland]], as arranged by [[Giles Farnaby]] and by [[William Byrd]].\n\nIn [[1899 in music|1899]], [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] published an edition in two volumes (the Maitland Squire edition, see the Sources below) with only a basic critical commentary, which has been reprinted by [[Dover Publications]] and is available inexpensively. A microfilm facsimile of the manuscript is included in ''The music collections of the Cambridge libraries'' (Woodbridge, Conn. : Research Publications, 1991). Musica Britannica is preparing a volume dedicated to the \"Keyboard Music from Fitzwilliam Manuscripts\" [http://www.musicabritannica.org.uk/volumes.html#further%20vols].\n\n[[Richard Strauss]] used several selections from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in his 1935 opera, ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'', and cited them accordingly at their appearances in the work. They appear at ritualized moments in the action to provide commentary and atmosphere in the Act 2 marriage scene (No. XIV and No. XC) and in the Act 3 courtroom scene (No. XXXVII).\n\nThe first recording of selections from the anthology was made by [[Joseph Payne (musician)|Joseph Payne]] in 1964. It was issued by Vox Box (i.e. [[Vox Records]]) as a three-LP boxed set and features Payne performing three album sides on harpsichord (a modern Eric Herz instrument) and three sides on organ.  Generally the more moderately paced and sustained pieces are performed on the organ.\n\n==The pieces in the book==\n\n(For each composer, the pieces follow the order in which they appear in the manuscript)\n\n===Anonymous===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Alman\n* Barafostus' Dreame\n* Muscadin\n* Alman\n* Galiarda\n* Praeludium, El.

Performed by Ulrich Metzner on a harpsichord of the type used in the early 20th century|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe '''''Fitzwilliam Virginal Book''''' is a primary source of keyboard music from the late [[Elizabethan]] and early [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods in [[England]], i.e., the late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and very early [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. It takes its name from [[Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam|Viscount Fitzwilliam]] who bequeathed this manuscript collection to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1816. It is now deposited in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] at Cambridge.\nAlthough the word [[virginals]] or '''virginal''' (the plural form does not necessarily denote more than one instrument) is used today to refer to a specific instrument similar to a small, portable [[harpsichord]], at the time of the book the word was used to denote virtually any [[keyboard instrument]] including the [[organ (music)|organ]].\n==History==\nIt was given no title by its copyist and the ownership of the manuscript before the eighteenth century is unclear.\nAt the time the ''Fitzwilliam Virginal Book'' was put together most collections of keyboard music were compiled by performers: other examples include ''Will Forster's Virginal Book'', ''[[Clement Matchett's Virginal Book]]'', and ''[[Anne Cromwell's Virginal Book]]''. Until ''[[Parthenia (music)|Parthenia]]'' was printed in about 1612, there was no keyboard music published as such in England, because of the technical complexity of printing keyboard music as opposed to, for example, vocal parts.\n\nIt was once called ''[[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth's]] Virginal Book'', a title that has been abandoned because it has been determined that she never owned it,\nAnother hypothesis, which still has supporters, is that it belonged to [[Francis Tregian the Younger]], a [[recusant]] and amateur musician. It has been argued that Tregian may have copied the entire collection while imprisoned in the period leading up to his death in 1618. The nature of Tregian's contribution to the book, if any, has been disputed.<ref>Ruby Reid Thompson, Francis Tregian the Younger as music copyist: A legend and an alternative view. Music and Letters 2001 82: 1-31; {{doi|10.1093/ml/82.1.1}}</ref> Recent scholarship suggests that even if Tregian is the compiler, it is unlikely that he was imprisoned long enough to do the copying involved.<ref>Kah-Ming Ng, liner notes to ''The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: Transcriptions for a Mixed Consort,'' charivari agr\u00e9able, Signum Records SIGD009</ref>\n\nIt includes music dating from approximately 1562 to 1612 by [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]], [[William Byrd]], [[Orlando Gibbons]], [[Giles Farnaby]] (51 of whose 52 known pieces are included), Martin Peerson, [[Peter Philips]] and [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]], as well as many others. There are 297 separate pieces (actually, 298: one piece is numbered, but is blank. Strangely, the Maitland Squire edition numbers No. 182 twice).  As with many keyboard manuscripts of the time, the pieces were not written for a specific instrument, and most sound happily on all contemporary keyboard instruments, including [[virginals]], [[harpsichord]], [[clavichord]] and [[chamber organ]].<ref>A few of the pieces presuppose an instrument arranged with a [[short octave]] in the bass, since they contain large intervals for the left hand that cannot be reached on the modern keyboard. The short octave was widely employed in all four instruments mentioned in the main text.</ref> Many of the pieces in the book are short, and many of them are character pieces with droll and memorable titles, including  \"Put Up Thy Dagger, Jemy\", \"The New Sa-Hoo\", and \"Quodlings Delight\" by [[Giles Farnaby]]; \"Nobody's Gigge\", by [[Richard Farnaby]]; \"Pakington's Pownde\" and \"The Irishe Dumpe\" (anonymous); \"The Ghost\" and \"The Earle of Oxford's Marche\" by [[William Byrd]]; \"Worster Braules\" by [[Thomas Tomkins]]; and the famous \"[[Lachrymae Pavan]]\" by [[John Dowland]], as arranged by [[Giles Farnaby]] and by [[William Byrd]].\n\nIn [[1899 in music|1899]], [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] published an edition in two volumes (the Maitland Squire edition, see the Sources below) with only a basic critical commentary, which has been reprinted by [[Dover Publications]] and is available inexpensively. A microfilm facsimile of the manuscript is included in ''The music collections of the Cambridge libraries'' (Woodbridge, Conn. : Research Publications, 1991). Musica Britannica is preparing a volume dedicated to the \"Keyboard Music from Fitzwilliam Manuscripts\" [http://www.musicabritannica.org.uk/volumes.html#further%20vols].\n\n[[Richard Strauss]] used several selections from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in his 1935 opera, ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'', and cited them accordingly at their appearances in the work. They appear at ritualized moments in the action to provide commentary and atmosphere in the Act 2 marriage scene (No. XIV and No. XC) and in the Act 3 courtroom scene (No. XXXVII).\n\nThe first recording of selections from the anthology was made by [[Joseph Payne (musician)|Joseph Payne]] in 1964. It was issued by Vox Box (i.e. [[Vox Records]]) as a three-LP boxed set and features Payne performing three album sides on harpsichord (a modern Eric Herz instrument) and three sides on organ.  Generally the more moderately paced and sustained pieces are performed on the organ.\n\n==The pieces in the book==\n\n(For each composer, the pieces follow the order in which they appear in the manuscript)\n\n===Anonymous===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Alman\n* Barafostus' Dreame\n* Muscadin\n* Alman\n* Galiarda\n* Praeludium, El.
