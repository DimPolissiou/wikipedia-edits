It was the top [[Grandes \u00e9coles|grande \u00e9cole]] in [[France]] in the field of Electrical engineering, Energy and Information sciences.\n\nFounded in 1894 and initially located in the 15th district of Paris, it was moved to [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] in 1975. Since then, two more campuses have been established, in [[Rennes]] in 1972 and [[Metz]] in 1985. It is a member of [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] (TIME) network. It is also a member of the [[CESAER Association]] and n+i Engineering Studies.\n\nIn 2015, Sup\u00e9lec merged with [[\u00c9cole Centrale Paris]] and became [[CentraleSup\u00e9lec]]. [[CentraleSup\u00e9lec]] is a member of [[Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay]].\n\n== History ==\nSup\u00e9lec was founded in 1894 by [[Eleuth\u00e8re Mascart]]. He was elected: Perpetual Member and Secretary of the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences'' and Foreign Member of the British Royal Society, Professor at the ''Coll\u00e8ge de France'', and won the Bordin Prize in 1866 and the Grand prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1874.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, the director of Sup\u00e9lec was [[Alain Bravo]]. [[Herv\u00e9 Biausser]] became the director in 1 September 2013, while keeping the directorship of [[Centrale Paris]].\n\nHistorically the goal of Sup\u00e9lec was to educate engineers for the then booming electrical industry.\n\n== Location ==\nSup\u00e9lec was originally based in Rue de Sta\u00ebl, 15th district of Paris. Then it moved to [[Malakoff]], close to Porte de Vanves and to [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] in 1975 where the main campus is currently located. A second campus was established in [[Rennes]] in 1972 and a third one in [[Metz]] in 1985.\n\n== Academics ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\nThe student body consists of 1,975 graduate students spread over Sup\u00e9lec's three campuses, and 780 full-time and part-time faculty (October 2009). As is historically true of engineering institutions, female enrollment at Sup\u00e9lec is low, with about three times as many male students as female students. However, this is slowly changing due to the school's outreach programs to encourage more female high school students to consider careers in science and engineering. These include the ''\"Ing\u00e9nieure: un avenir au f\u00e9minin\"'' program. In 2008, 25% of graduates were foreign students, coming from 22 countries.\n\n=== Funding ===\nSup\u00e9lec is a private non-profit institution ([[Voluntary association|Association loi 1901]]) under the supervision of the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of Higher Education]] and the [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)|Ministry of Industry]]. In 2008, Sup\u00e9lec's revenue amounted to \u20ac35 million, with 48% of that amount from the state, 24% from research contracts and 5% from tuition and fees. About 25% of the school's expenses went to research (\u20ac8.6 million) and 68% to faculty and staff.\n\n=== Rankings ===\nSup\u00e9lec is consistently ranked well; it has remained in the top five engineering schools in France. In 2013, ''[[L'Etudiant]]'' ranked Sup\u00e9lec the fourth engineering school in France (ex aequo),<ref>See 2013 [http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-ecole-ingenieur-apres-prepa.html ranking] from [[L'Etudiant]] (fr)</ref> and according to salary surveys its graduates are among the highest paid of all French graduates.<ref>For example, see [http://www.lexpansion.com/carriere/classement/jeune_dip.asp?idc=124718&tf_id=1 ranking] from [[L'Expansion]] (fr)</ref>\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nEducation at Sup\u00e9lec is multidipliscinary and typically lasts three to four years. During the first two years, students are required to take classes in science (statistics, probability, quantum mechanics,...), in engineering (computer programming, signal processing,...) and in social sciences (economics, foreign languages,...), and can choose elective classes as numerous as varied (arts, supraconductivity, sustainable development, finance, biology, psychology,...). For their third year, students choose a major in a specific field among fifteen for half the course, and the second half is devoted to research and development activities in the form of laboratory studies, project work, industrial research contracts.\n\nStudents are also warmly encouraged to spend at least six months abroad in one of Sup\u00e9lec's 70 partner universities, or they can spend two years abroad instead of their third year at Sup\u00e9lec and graduate from both Sup\u00e9lec and the partner university. In 2008, 40% of graduates have obtained double degrees. Partners include world leading institutions like [[MIT]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Georgia Tech]] in the US, [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]] in the UK.\n\nAfter graduation, graduates find employment in diverse areas including Engineering, R&D, Consulting and Banking, or pursue PhD studies.\n\n=== Admission ===\nThe admission as first year student to Sup\u00e9lec is generally made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in ''[[Classes Pr\u00e9paratoires]]''. Admission includes a week of written examinations, during Spring, followed by oral examinations which are handled in batches spanning over Summer, and is done in common with the [[Centrale Graduate School]]. About 10% of graduates were admitted after obtaining a three-year degree in a French university,<ref>[http://www.performance-publique.gouv.fr/farandole/2010/pap/pdf/Jaune2010recherche_formationsuperieures.pdf Annexe au projet de loi de finances pour 2010; Projets annuels de performances de la Mission interminist\u00e9rielle Recherche et Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur, p 178] (fr)</ref> 25% are foreign students through international exchange programs.\n\n=== Research ===\nSup\u00e9lec is profoundly involved in research; it is one of the only three institutions in France with [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure|ENS Ulm]] and [[Ecole polytechnique]] to be a member of two Advanced Research Thematic Networks (R\u00e9seaux th\u00e9matiques de recherch\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e, RTRA) \u2013 research associations grouping private or public research institutions and private companies working together on specific research fields.\n\nThe school carries out both academic and industrial research, especially for the education of its students through partnership with companies (research contracts), in 14 laboratories and research departments.\n\nSup\u00e9lec has its own research teams and mixed units with [[CNRS]] and partner universities. Sup\u00e9lec is also involved in 5 doctoral schools with its partner universities (Paris Sud, Rennes 1, Nancy 1, Nancy 2, Metz).\n\nIn 2007, Sup\u00e9lec obtained along with [[Centrale Paris]] the [[label Carnot]], a label of excellence awarded by \u2018\u2019Agence nationale de la recherche\u2019\u2019 (National Agency for Research) to research institutions in France and intended to [[Research funding|finance research]].\n\nIn 2008, \u20ac8.6 million were invested in research, \u20ac6 million of which came from research contracts with 122 partner companies and institutions.\n\n=== Industry connections ===\nPartnerships with the industry have always been a priority. In 1986, Sup\u00e9lec founded the Teaching and Research Partnership in Cooperation with Business (PERCI&S), a network of privileged companies, in order to widen the openings to graduates and to develop research involving students. Members of PERCI include [[Accenture]], [[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Areva]], [[EADS]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Siemens]], [[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|EDF]], [[Capgemini]], among 36 companies in total.<ref>Details in [http://www.supelec.fr/bref/Plaquette_PERCI_2009.pdf PERCI official brochure] (fr)</ref>\n\nThe implication of the students in the industry is stressed, as they are required to complete at least 3 hands-on internships during their three years of studies, one of which is a 5-month-long project work or industrial research contract in a company.\n\nEvery year in early December, a job fair is held at Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Paris and managed by Forum Centrale-Sup\u00e9lec, a [[student society]].\n\n=== Partnership agreements with other institutions ===\n[[Centrale Paris]] and Sup\u00e9lec signed an outline agreement in 2005 in order to mutualize third year majors. Both of the schools already enrolled students at the end of [[Classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles|Preparatory class]] through a common examination; they now share a common major in [[Energy]]. Since 2005 their cooperation has been strengthened, especially in research and industrial partnerships (the awarding of the \u2018\u2019label Carnot\u2019\u2019 to the Centrale-Sup\u00e9lec-CNRS (C3S) grouping is a significant result). In 2008, they declare their partnership a strategic alliance.<ref>[http://www.supelec.fr/actu/alliance-Centrale-Supelec.pdf L\u2019Ecole Centrale Paris et Sup\u00e9lec annoncent leur alliance strat\u00e9gique, Sup\u00e9lec official website] (fr)</ref>\n\nSup\u00e9lec students can choose to spend a non-graduating semester or graduate from one of the school\u2019s partner universities, in France or abroad. Among them, Sup\u00e9lec and [[ESCP Europe]] have developed a partnership giving Sup\u00e9lec students the opportunity to graduate with a Master in Business. Other specialization degrees exist with [[IFP School]], or [[Paris-Sud 11 University]].\n\nOne of the objectives of the institution for the period 2006-2009 was to reinforce the internationalization of the school by encouraging students to spend at least a semester abroad or to do a double-degree program in one the Sup\u00e9lec\u2019s foreign partner universities, and by increasing the number of foreign students at Sup\u00e9lec.\n\n[[File:Tanaka Business School - Imperial College 24-06-2004.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|[[Imperial College]] main entrance]]\nAgreements have been reached with other institutions of higher education whereby a number of Sup\u00e9lec students attend courses provided by these establishments instead of completing their third year at the school. The successful completion of these studies is a condition for obtaining the Sup\u00e9lec engineering degree in addition to the diploma related to the course of study in question. Agreements exist with a large number of departments in American, Australian, Canadian, Japanese and European universities. Among them, [[Georgia Tech]], [[Columbia University]], [[Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[Imperial College London]], [[Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen]].<ref>See [http://www.supelec.fr/363_p_9563/international-partners.html complete list of international partners] on official website (en)</ref>\n\nSup\u00e9lec has agreements and exchanges with more than 70 foreign universities, in over 30 countries and runs the [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] (T.I.M.E) network and is a member of the [[CESAER Association]] and n+i engineering institutes. In 2008, 40% of graduates have obtained double-degrees and 35% completed their final year of study abroad.<ref>See [http://www.supelec.fr/bref/Plaquette_chiffres_2008_GB.pdf official key figures 2008] (en)</ref>\n\n=== Key Figures (2008)<ref>Key Figures 2008: [http://www.supelec.fr/bref/Plaquette_chiffres_2008_GB.pdf Official brochure] (en)</ref> ===\n\n'''Overview:'''\n* Revenues : \u20ac35 million\n* Alumni Association Budget : \u20ac12 million\n\n'''Students:'''\n* 2,000 Students\n*  460 Engineering degrees\n*    6 Specialized Master programs\n*  250 Doctoral students\n\n'''International:'''\n* 1 out of 5 graduates is international\n* Sup\u00e9lec has agreements and exchanges with more than 70 foreign universities, in over 30 countries\n* Sup\u00e9lec runs the Top Industrial Managers for Europe (T.I.M.E) network and is a member of the CESAER and n+i engineering institutes\n* 40% of graduates have obtained double degrees\n* 25% of graduates were foreign students, coming from 22 countries\n\n'''Faculty and Staff:'''\n* 130 Full-time faculty\n* 650 Part-time teachers\n* 175 Administrators and staff\n\n'''Research:'''\n*  14 laboratories and research departments\n* 465 research personnel\n* 725 major international publications and conference papers\n*  17 patents\n* 320 outgoing projects\n* 122 partner companies and institutions\n* \u20ac8.6 million in research funding\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\nAt the Gif-sur-Yvette campus, several activities are provided by the associations:\n* The 'Bureau des Eleves' (BdE) and some other associations (Forum, Junior Entreprise, etc.) organize parties on a regular basis;\n* The 'Bureau des Sports' enables students to practise sports. Since the Gif-sur-Yvette campus is equipped with a soccer pitch, a tennis court, a gymnasium, etc., students are able to play most common sports in France. Moreover, every Thursday afternoon, competitions between different French schools and universities are organized.\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nAll the Supelec campus own housing amenities for the students.\n\nGif-sur-Yvette campus is composed of three types of residences:\n\n* Residence 1: this residence is the oldest one. Most of students living there are first-year students. Each student has his own room. Bathrooms are shared by two students, and kitchen by about twenty students.\n* Residence 2: this residence is made up by four buildings. Each building is composed of several flats for five or six students. In each flat, there are three or four restrooms, and a large living room.\n* Residence 3: this residence is made up by flats for one person or for pairs.\n\n=== Arts ===\n\n=== Student Media ===\n\n== Events ==\n\nEvery year, many events are organized by Supelec students:\n* In September, first year and many second year students take part in a ''WEI'';\n* In October, the ''Gala Supelec'' happens;\n* In December, most famous companies participate in the ''Forum Supelec'';\n* In January, the ''Campagne BdE'' happens;\n* Etc.\n\n=== Forum Supelec ===\nThe forum Supelec is an event bringing together many famous companies: EDF, Renault, BNP Paribas, PSA, CapGemini, Accenture, Mazars, Logica, etc. This event takes place in Supelec every year, at Gif-sur-Yvette campus. It is a good opportunity for many students to find an internship.\n\n== Campus ==\n\n=== Gif-sur-Yvette ===\n\nGif-sur-Yvette is the main and biggest campus. It is located on the ''Plateau du Moulon'', an important site for French education. Currently, other famous French Graduate Schools are building their campus there: ENS Paris-Saclay, Ecole Centrale Paris, etc.\nMany activities can be performed in the Gif-sur-Yvette campus: jogging, tennis, basketball, pool, etc.\n\n=== Rennes ===\nThis campus is located in the periphery of Rennes. It features wide green spaces and is well linked to the center: 15 minutes by public transport makes it ideal for students who want to profit from the rich student life of the city. It is also close to other schools like the University of Rennes 1 and 2 and INSA.\n\n=== Metz ===\n\nThe campus is located on the ''Technopole Metz 2000'', next to other institutions such as [[Georgia Tech Lorraine]] and [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et m\u00e9tiers|ENSAM]].\n\n== Alumni ==\nSup\u00e9lec alumni include: [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]], [[Pierre Boulle]], [[Thierry Breton]], [[Louis Charles Breguet]], [[Henri Chr\u00e9tien]], Herv\u00e9 Laborne, [[Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re]], [[Rene Leduc]], [[Philippe Morillon]], [[Jean Deleage]], [[Ambroise Roux]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bensahel|first1=Nathalie|last2=Riche|first2=Pascal|title=Ambroise Roux passe de l'ombre \u00e0 tr\u00e9pas.Le plus puissant lobbyiste du patronat fran\u00e7ais est mort dimanche \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 77 ans.

He was elected: Perpetual Member and Secretary of the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences'' and Foreign Member of the British Royal Society, Professor at the ''Coll\u00e8ge de France'', and won the Bordin Prize in 1866 and the Grand prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1874.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2013, the director of Sup\u00e9lec was [[Alain Bravo]]. [[Herv\u00e9 Biausser]] became the director in 1 September 2013, while keeping the directorship of [[Centrale Paris]].\n\nHistorically the goal of Sup\u00e9lec was to educate engineers for the then booming electrical industry.\n\n== Location ==\nSup\u00e9lec was originally based in Rue de Sta\u00ebl, 15th district of Paris. Then it moved to [[Malakoff]], close to Porte de Vanves and to [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] in 1975 where the main campus is currently located. A second campus was established in [[Rennes]] in 1972 and a third one in [[Metz]] in 1985.\n\n== Academics ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\nThe student body consists of 1,975 graduate students spread over Sup\u00e9lec's three campuses, and 780 full-time and part-time faculty (October 2009). As is historically true of engineering institutions, female enrollment at Sup\u00e9lec is low, with about three times as many male students as female students. However, this is slowly changing due to the school's outreach programs to encourage more female high school students to consider careers in science and engineering. These include the ''\"Ing\u00e9nieure: un avenir au f\u00e9minin\"'' program. In 2008, 25% of graduates were foreign students, coming from 22 countries.\n\n=== Funding ===\nSup\u00e9lec is a private non-profit institution ([[Voluntary association|Association loi 1901]]) under the supervision of the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of Higher Education]] and the [[Minister of the Economy, Industry and Employment (France)|Ministry of Industry]]. In 2008, Sup\u00e9lec's revenue amounted to \u20ac35 million, with 48% of that amount from the state, 24% from research contracts and 5% from tuition and fees. About 25% of the school's expenses went to research (\u20ac8.6 million) and 68% to faculty and staff.\n\n=== Rankings ===\nSup\u00e9lec is consistently ranked well; it has remained in the top five engineering schools in France. In 2013, ''[[L'Etudiant]]'' ranked Sup\u00e9lec the fourth engineering school in France (ex aequo),<ref>See 2013 [http://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-ecole-ingenieur-apres-prepa.html ranking] from [[L'Etudiant]] (fr)</ref> and according to salary surveys its graduates are among the highest paid of all French graduates.<ref>For example, see [http://www.lexpansion.com/carriere/classement/jeune_dip.asp?idc=124718&tf_id=1 ranking] from [[L'Expansion]] (fr)</ref>\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nEducation at Sup\u00e9lec is multidipliscinary and typically lasts three to four years. During the first two years, students are required to take classes in science (statistics, probability, quantum mechanics,...), in engineering (computer programming, signal processing,...) and in social sciences (economics, foreign languages,...), and can choose elective classes as numerous as varied (arts, supraconductivity, sustainable development, finance, biology, psychology,...). For their third year, students choose a major in a specific field among fifteen for half the course, and the second half is devoted to research and development activities in the form of laboratory studies, project work, industrial research contracts.\n\nStudents are also warmly encouraged to spend at least six months abroad in one of Sup\u00e9lec's 70 partner universities, or they can spend two years abroad instead of their third year at Sup\u00e9lec and graduate from both Sup\u00e9lec and the partner university. In 2008, 40% of graduates have obtained double degrees. Partners include world leading institutions like [[MIT]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[Georgia Tech]] in the US, [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]] in the UK.\n\nAfter graduation, graduates find employment in diverse areas including Engineering, R&D, Consulting and Banking, or pursue PhD studies.\n\n=== Admission ===\nThe admission as first year student to Sup\u00e9lec is generally made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in ''[[Classes Pr\u00e9paratoires]]''. Admission includes a week of written examinations, during Spring, followed by oral examinations which are handled in batches spanning over Summer, and is done in common with the [[Centrale Graduate School]]. About 10% of graduates were admitted after obtaining a three-year degree in a French university,<ref>[http://www.performance-publique.gouv.fr/farandole/2010/pap/pdf/Jaune2010recherche_formationsuperieures.pdf Annexe au projet de loi de finances pour 2010; Projets annuels de performances de la Mission interminist\u00e9rielle Recherche et Enseignement Sup\u00e9rieur, p 178] (fr)</ref> 25% are foreign students through international exchange programs.\n\n=== Research ===\nSup\u00e9lec is profoundly involved in research; it is one of the only three institutions in France with [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure|ENS Ulm]] and [[Ecole polytechnique]] to be a member of two Advanced Research Thematic Networks (R\u00e9seaux th\u00e9matiques de recherch\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e, RTRA) \u2013 research associations grouping private or public research institutions and private companies working together on specific research fields.\n\nThe school carries out both academic and industrial research, especially for the education of its students through partnership with companies (research contracts), in 14 laboratories and research departments.\n\nSup\u00e9lec has its own research teams and mixed units with [[CNRS]] and partner universities. Sup\u00e9lec is also involved in 5 doctoral schools with its partner universities (Paris Sud, Rennes 1, Nancy 1, Nancy 2, Metz).\n\nIn 2007, Sup\u00e9lec obtained along with [[Centrale Paris]] the [[label Carnot]], a label of excellence awarded by \u2018\u2019Agence nationale de la recherche\u2019\u2019 (National Agency for Research) to research institutions in France and intended to [[Research funding|finance research]].\n\nIn 2008, \u20ac8.6 million were invested in research, \u20ac6 million of which came from research contracts with 122 partner companies and institutions.\n\n=== Industry connections ===\nPartnerships with the industry have always been a priority. In 1986, Sup\u00e9lec founded the Teaching and Research Partnership in Cooperation with Business (PERCI&S), a network of privileged companies, in order to widen the openings to graduates and to develop research involving students. Members of PERCI include [[Accenture]], [[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Areva]], [[EADS]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Siemens]], [[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|EDF]], [[Capgemini]], among 36 companies in total.<ref>Details in [http://www.supelec.fr/bref/Plaquette_PERCI_2009.pdf PERCI official brochure] (fr)</ref>\n\nThe implication of the students in the industry is stressed, as they are required to complete at least 3 hands-on internships during their three years of studies, one of which is a 5-month-long project work or industrial research contract in a company.\n\nEvery year in early December, a job fair is held at Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Paris and managed by Forum Centrale-Sup\u00e9lec, a [[student society]].\n\n=== Partnership agreements with other institutions ===\n[[Centrale Paris]] and Sup\u00e9lec signed an outline agreement in 2005 in order to mutualize third year majors. Both of the schools already enrolled students at the end of [[Classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles|Preparatory class]] through a common examination; they now share a common major in [[Energy]]. Since 2005 their cooperation has been strengthened, especially in research and industrial partnerships (the awarding of the \u2018\u2019label Carnot\u2019\u2019 to the Centrale-Sup\u00e9lec-CNRS (C3S) grouping is a significant result). In 2008, they declare their partnership a strategic alliance.<ref>[http://www.supelec.fr/actu/alliance-Centrale-Supelec.pdf L\u2019Ecole Centrale Paris et Sup\u00e9lec annoncent leur alliance strat\u00e9gique, Sup\u00e9lec official website] (fr)</ref>\n\nSup\u00e9lec students can choose to spend a non-graduating semester or graduate from one of the school\u2019s partner universities, in France or abroad. Among them, Sup\u00e9lec and [[ESCP Europe]] have developed a partnership giving Sup\u00e9lec students the opportunity to graduate with a Master in Business. Other specialization degrees exist with [[IFP School]], or [[Paris-Sud 11 University]].\n\nOne of the objectives of the institution for the period 2006-2009 was to reinforce the internationalization of the school by encouraging students to spend at least a semester abroad or to do a double-degree program in one the Sup\u00e9lec\u2019s foreign partner universities, and by increasing the number of foreign students at Sup\u00e9lec.\n\n[[File:Tanaka Business School - Imperial College 24-06-2004.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|[[Imperial College]] main entrance]]\nAgreements have been reached with other institutions of higher education whereby a number of Sup\u00e9lec students attend courses provided by these establishments instead of completing their third year at the school. The successful completion of these studies is a condition for obtaining the Sup\u00e9lec engineering degree in addition to the diploma related to the course of study in question. Agreements exist with a large number of departments in American, Australian, Canadian, Japanese and European universities. Among them, [[Georgia Tech]], [[Columbia University]], [[Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[Imperial College London]], [[Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen]].<ref>See [http://www.supelec.fr/363_p_9563/international-partners.html complete list of international partners] on official website (en)</ref>\n\nSup\u00e9lec has agreements and exchanges with more than 70 foreign universities, in over 30 countries and runs the [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] (T.I.M.E) network and is a member of the [[CESAER Association]] and n+i engineering institutes. In 2008, 40% of graduates have obtained double-degrees and 35% completed their final year of study abroad.<ref>See [http://www.supelec.fr/bref/Plaquette_chiffres_2008_GB.pdf official key figures 2008] (en)</ref>\n\n=== Key Figures (2008)<ref>Key Figures 2008: [http://www.supelec.fr/bref/Plaquette_chiffres_2008_GB.pdf Official brochure] (en)</ref> ===\n\n'''Overview:'''\n* Revenues : \u20ac35 million\n* Alumni Association Budget : \u20ac12 million\n\n'''Students:'''\n* 2,000 Students\n*  460 Engineering degrees\n*    6 Specialized Master programs\n*  250 Doctoral students\n\n'''International:'''\n* 1 out of 5 graduates is international\n* Sup\u00e9lec has agreements and exchanges with more than 70 foreign universities, in over 30 countries\n* Sup\u00e9lec runs the Top Industrial Managers for Europe (T.I.M.E) network and is a member of the CESAER and n+i engineering institutes\n* 40% of graduates have obtained double degrees\n* 25% of graduates were foreign students, coming from 22 countries\n\n'''Faculty and Staff:'''\n* 130 Full-time faculty\n* 650 Part-time teachers\n* 175 Administrators and staff\n\n'''Research:'''\n*  14 laboratories and research departments\n* 465 research personnel\n* 725 major international publications and conference papers\n*  17 patents\n* 320 outgoing projects\n* 122 partner companies and institutions\n* \u20ac8.6 million in research funding\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Recreation ===\n\nAt the Gif-sur-Yvette campus, several activities are provided by the associations:\n* The 'Bureau des Eleves' (BdE) and some other associations (Forum, Junior Entreprise, etc.) organize parties on a regular basis;\n* The 'Bureau des Sports' enables students to practise sports. Since the Gif-sur-Yvette campus is equipped with a soccer pitch, a tennis court, a gymnasium, etc., students are able to play most common sports in France. Moreover, every Thursday afternoon, competitions between different French schools and universities are organized.\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nAll the Supelec campus own housing amenities for the students.\n\nGif-sur-Yvette campus is composed of three types of residences:\n\n* Residence 1: this residence is the oldest one. Most of students living there are first-year students. Each student has his own room. Bathrooms are shared by two students, and kitchen by about twenty students.\n* Residence 2: this residence is made up by four buildings. Each building is composed of several flats for five or six students. In each flat, there are three or four restrooms, and a large living room.\n* Residence 3: this residence is made up by flats for one person or for pairs.\n\n=== Arts ===\n\n=== Student Media ===\n\n== Events ==\n\nEvery year, many events are organized by Supelec students:\n* In September, first year and many second year students take part in a ''WEI'';\n* In October, the ''Gala Supelec'' happens;\n* In December, most famous companies participate in the ''Forum Supelec'';\n* In January, the ''Campagne BdE'' happens;\n* Etc.\n\n=== Forum Supelec ===\nThe forum Supelec is an event bringing together many famous companies: EDF, Renault, BNP Paribas, PSA, CapGemini, Accenture, Mazars, Logica, etc. This event takes place in Supelec every year, at Gif-sur-Yvette campus. It is a good opportunity for many students to find an internship.\n\n== Campus ==\n\n=== Gif-sur-Yvette ===\n\nGif-sur-Yvette is the main and biggest campus. It is located on the ''Plateau du Moulon'', an important site for French education. Currently, other famous French Graduate Schools are building their campus there: ENS Paris-Saclay, Ecole Centrale Paris, etc.\nMany activities can be performed in the Gif-sur-Yvette campus: jogging, tennis, basketball, pool, etc.\n\n=== Rennes ===\nThis campus is located in the periphery of Rennes. It features wide green spaces and is well linked to the center: 15 minutes by public transport makes it ideal for students who want to profit from the rich student life of the city. It is also close to other schools like the University of Rennes 1 and 2 and INSA.\n\n=== Metz ===\n\nThe campus is located on the ''Technopole Metz 2000'', next to other institutions such as [[Georgia Tech Lorraine]] and [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et m\u00e9tiers|ENSAM]].\n\n== Alumni ==\nSup\u00e9lec alumni include: [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]], [[Pierre Boulle]], [[Thierry Breton]], [[Louis Charles Breguet]], [[Henri Chr\u00e9tien]], [[Herv\u00e9 Laborne]], [[Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re]], [[Rene Leduc]], [[Philippe Morillon]], [[Jean Deleage]], [[Ambroise Roux]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bensahel|first1=Nathalie|last2=Riche|first2=Pascal|title=Ambroise Roux passe de l'ombre \u00e0 tr\u00e9pas.Le plus puissant lobbyiste du patronat fran\u00e7ais est mort dimanche \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 77 ans.
