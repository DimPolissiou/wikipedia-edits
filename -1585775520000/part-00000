In particular it shows the lives of [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian Canadian]] settlers from the years 1899 to 1930. Buildings from surrounding communities have been moved to the historic site and restored to various years within the first part of the twentieth century.\n\n\"The Village\", as it is colloquially known, has a very strong commitment to [[Authenticity (reenactment)|historical authenticity]] and the concept of [[living history]].  The Village uses a technique known as [[first-person interpretation]] which requires that the costumed performers remain ''in character'' at all times (or as much as is feasibly possible).  Actors answer all questions as if it is the year their building portrays.  Although this technique is startling for some visitors at first, it allows for a much stronger experience of immersion in history than traditional [[third-person interpretation]] where the actor acknowledges that he is, in fact, in a museum.\n[[File:UCHV elevator.jpg|thumb|right|Home Grain Co.

He is best known for being received as the first [[List of ambassadors of Colombia to the United States|ambassador of Colombia]] by U.S. President [[James Monroe]] on June{{nbsp}}19, 1822. This act represented the first U.S. recognition of a former Spanish colony's independence.\n\nBorn in Spain, he lived as a young adult in the colony of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (present-day Colombia). After being implicated in a conspiracy against the monarchy he fled in 1794, arriving in the United States in 1796. From [[Philadelphia]] he spent the rest of his life advocating for independence of the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Working closely with newspaper editor [[William Duane (journalist)|William Duane]] he produced English- and Spanish-language articles, pamphlets and books.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] he was a central figure in directing the work of revolutionary agents in North America, who frequently visited his home. In 1819 Torres was appointed a diplomat for Venezuela, which that year united with New Granada to form [[Gran Colombia]]. As ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]'' he negotiated significant weapons purchases but failed to obtain public loans. Having laid the groundwork for the [[diplomatic recognition]] of Colombia, he died less than a month after achieving this goal. Though largely unknown today, he is remembered as an early proponent of [[Pan-Americanism]].\n\n==Early life==\nManuel Torres was born in the Spanish [[Kingdom of C\u00f3rdoba|region of C\u00f3rdoba]] in early November 1762.{{efn-lr|Some sources, including the plaque at St. Mary's, give 1764 instead. {{harvtxt|Bowman|1971b|loc=p.{{nbsp}}440 n.{{nbsp}}5}} derives the 1762 birthday from two letters Torres wrote Mier in 1821: on October{{nbsp}}31 he said he was aged 58, on November{{nbsp}}18 he said he was 59.}} His mother's family was from the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|city of C\u00f3rdoba]] while his father's side was probably from nearby [[Baena]]. He was descended from the minor nobility on both sides of his family, a class with social stature but not necessarily wealth.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\n[[File:Antonio Caballero y G\u00f3ngora.jpg|thumb|Antonio Caballero y G\u00f3ngora, Torres' uncle]]\n\nIn the spring of 1776 the young Torres sailed to Cuba with his maternal uncle [[Antonio Caballero y G\u00f3ngora]], who was consecrated there as bishop of [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (modern Mexico). Torres would later attribute his republican ideals to his uncle, a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who was an extensive collector of books, art, and coins. After Caballero y G\u00f3ngora was promoted to archbishop of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]] the family arrived in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (modern Colombia) on June 29, 1778.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=417\u2013418}}\n\nAt age 17 Torres began working for the secretariat of the Viceroyalty and for the royal treasury. In the following seven years he learned finance and was able to observe the political and social conflicts in New Grenada, including the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]]. This was also the time of the [[American Revolution]], which [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Spain joined against Great Britain]]. Caballero y G\u00f3ngora became viceroy in 1782 and ruled as a liberal modernizer.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=423\u2013424}}\n\nTorres went to France in early 1785 to study at the {{ill|Sor\u00e8ze abbey|lt=\u00c9cole Royale Militaire at Sor\u00e8ze|fr|Abbaye de Sor\u00e8ze}}, where he spent about a year and half learning [[military science]] and mathematics. As lieutenant of engineers ({{lang-es|teniente de ingenerios}}) he probably aided Colonel [[Domingo Esquiaqui]]'s survey and helped reorganize the colonial garrisons.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=429\u2013431}} On presentation by the archbishop-viceroy, Torres was gifted land near [[Santa Marta]] by [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles{{nbsp}}IV]] and established a successful plantation, which he named San Carlos.{{efn-lr|{{harvtxt|Duane|1826|p=609}} described what he heard of the ruined plantation in 1823, suggesting what it used to be like: {{quote|I enquired; and learned there was not a vestige of a habitation: the forests which [Torres] had felled, and the gardens laid out and cultivated under his own eye, in which were collected and collecting all the riches of the botanical regions; the avenues of cotton trees and oranges, the groves of foreign firs on the lofty peaks, and the palms in the valleys, had lost their order and disposition[.]|}}}} Torres married and at San Carlos had a daughter.{{sfnp|Duane|1826|p=608}}{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=435\u2013437}}\n\nHe became involved with political liberals of Bogot\u00e1's {{lang|es|[[Criollo people|criollo]]}} class (i.e., native New Granadians of European descent), joining a secret club led by [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]] where radical ideas were discussed freely. When in 1794 Nari\u00f1o and other club members were implicated in a conspiracy against the Crown, Torres fled New Granada without his family. He first went to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and in 1796 to [[Philadelphia]],<ref>1797 is given by {{harvtxt|On\u00eds|1952|p=34}}; but for 1796 see {{harvp|Bemis|1939|p=21}}; {{harvp|Hern\u00e1ndez de Alba|1946|p=368}}; {{harvp|Bowman|1970|p=26}}.</ref> then the capital of the United States.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=434\u2013439}}\n\n===Arrival in Philadelphia===\nSpanish Americans heading north tended to go to Philadelphia, Baltimore or (French-controlled) New Orleans, centers of commercial relations with the colonies. Philadelphia in particular was a symbol of republican ideals, which may have attracted Torres. Its trade with the Spanish colonies was significant and the [[American Philosophical Society]] was the first learned society in the U.S. to nominate Spanish American members.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=26\u201327}} At [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St.{{nbsp}}Mary's Church]] he joined a cosmopolitan community of Roman Catholics, including many from Spanish and French America.{{sfnp|Warren|2004|pp=344\u2013347}}\n\n[[File:William Duane.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Engraving of Duane in profile|Influenced by Torres, William Duane and his ''Aurora'' became advocates for Spanish American independence.]]\n\nQuick to make American contacts, Torres became close friends with William Duane, who became editor of the Philadelphia newspaper ''[[Philadelphia Aurora|Aurora]]'' in 1798. The editor continually published Torres' views on Spanish American independence in the paper, whose contents would be copied by others. Torres translated Spanish [[pamphlets]] for Duane, and sometimes translated Duane's editorials to Spanish.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=40\u201341}} In Spanish America the purpose of this literature was to praise the United States as an example of independent [[representative government]] to be emulated; in the United States it was to increase support for the independence movements.{{sfnp|On\u00eds|1952|p=34}}\n\nInitially Torres was quite wealthy and received remittances from his wife, which helped him make important social connections. However, he had his money invested in risky merchant ventures; on one occasion he lost $40,000, on another $70,000\u2014thus he was forced to live more modestly in later years.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nThree years after Torres' arrival, a \"Spaniard in Philadelphia\" wrote the pamphlet ''{{lang|es|Reflexiones sobre el comercio de Espa\u00f1a con sus colonias en tiempo de guerra}}'' (released in English as ''Observations on the Commerce of Spain with her Colonies, in Time of War''). The author, probably Torres, criticizes Spanish colonialism. In particular, Spain monopolized trade with the colonies to their detriment: during wartime the mother country could not supply the colonies with essential goods, and in peacetime the prices were too high. The author's solution is to implement a system of [[free trade]] in the Americas.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=29\u201330}} The pamphlet was reprinted in London by [[William Tatham]].{{sfnp|Morrison|1922|p=84}}\n\nTorres' residence increased the attraction of Philadelphia for Spanish American revolutionaries. Torres probably met [[Francisco de Miranda]] (also exiled after a failed conspiracy) in 1805, shortly before Miranda's failed expedition to the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]], and he met with [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1806. The Spanish minister to the United States, [[Carlos Mart\u00ednez de Irujo, 1st Marquess of Casa Irujo|Carlos Mart\u00ednez de Irujo]],{{efn-lr|The seat of government moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1800, but the Spanish ministers continued to reside in Philadelphia.}} reported Torres' activity to his superiors.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Coordinating revolutionaries==\nDuring the instability caused by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquest of Spain\u2014the [[Peninsular War]]\u2014the people of the colonies followed the model of Peninsular Spanish provinces by organizing [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|juntas]] to govern in the absence of central rule. Advocates of independence, who called themselves Patriots, argued that sovereignty reverted to the people when there was no monarch. They clashed with the [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|Royalists]], who supported the authority of the Crown. Starting in 1810 the Patriot juntas successively declared independence, and Torres was their natural point of contact in the United States.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=31\u201333}}\n\n===Brokered weapons shipments===\nAlthough President [[James Madison]]'s administration officially recognized no governments on either side, Patriot agents were permitted to seek weapons in the U.S., and American ports became bases for [[privateering]]. Torres acted as an intermediary between the newly arrived agents and influential Americans, such as introducing {{ill|Juan Vicente Bol\u00edvar|es|Juan Vicente Bol\u00edvar Palacios}} (Sim\u00f3n's brother) to wealthy banker [[Stephen Girard]]. Juan Vicente successfully purchased weapons for Venezuela, but was lost at sea on his return journey in 1811.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|p=34}}\n\nTogether with Tel\u00e9sforo de Orea from Venezuela, and Diego de Saavadra and [[Juan Pedro Aguirre|Juan Pedro de Aguirre]] from Buenos Aires, Torres brokered a plan to purchase 20,000 muskets and bayonets from the U.S. government. Girard agreed to finance the plan on the joint credit of Buenos Aires and Venezuela, but Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] blocked it by refusing to reply. Savaadra and Aguirre managed to ship only 1,000 muskets to Buenos Aires, but by the end of 1811 Torres had helped Orea supply Venezuela with about 24,000 weapons. New purchasers continued to arrive, and the supplies were an important contribution while the revolutionaries were suffering many defeats.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=35\u201338}}\n\nThe new Spanish minister, [[Lu\u00eds de On\u00eds]], covertly attempted to disrupt the weapons shipments. He became aware of the plan to purchase from the U.S. arsenal due to being informed by a postman. On\u00eds reported on these subversive activities and his agents harassed suspected revolutionaries like Torres. Francisco Sarmiento and Miguel Cabral de Noro\u00f1a, two associates of On\u00eds, attempted to assassinate Torres in 1814\u2014apparently on the minister's orders.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|p=39}} Due to his aid for the revolution, Torres' estate in Royalist-controlled New Granada was confiscated after his wife and daughter died.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n===Public writing===\nRunning out of money during this period, Torres sustained himself in part by teaching. With [[Louis Hargous]] he wrote an adaptation for both English- and Spanish-teaching of [[Nicolas Gou\u00efn Dufief]]'s ''Nature Displayed in Her Mode of Teaching Language to Man''. The lengthy book's title page styles Torres and Hargous as \"professors of general grammar\"; in the introduction they argue the importance to Americans of studying Spanish literature.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=32\u201333}} Influential revised editions by [[Mariano Vel\u00e1zquez de la Cadena]] were published in New York (1825) and London (1826).{{sfnp|Vilar|2001|pp=245\u2013249}}\n\nSoon after ''Nature Displayed'' followed the 1812 pamphlet ''{{lang|es|Manual de un Republicano para el uso de un Pueblo libre}}'' (\"A Republican's Manual for the Use of a Free People\"), which Torres probably wrote. Structured as a dialog, the anonymous pamphlet offers a defense of the U.S. system of government based on the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and argues it should be a model for Spanish America. The contents suggest the author is \"a conservative partisan of [[Jeffersonian democracy]]\".<ref>{{harvtxt|On\u00eds|1952|p=35}} writes Torres' authorship \"is possible\"; {{harvtxt|Bowman|1970|pp=41\u201342}} writes he \"probably\" wrote it and infers Torres' Jeffersonianism.</ref>\n\nBesides Duane's ''Aurora'', Torres sent news and opinion to [[Baptis Irvine]]'s Baltimore ''Whig'' and New York ''Columbian'', [[Jonathan Elliot (historian)|Jonathan Elliot]]'s ''City of Washington Gazette'', and [[Hezekiah Niles]]' Baltimore ''Weekly Register''. He acquainted himself with notables such as Congressman [[Henry Clay]], lawyer [[Henry Marie Brackenridge]], Baltimore Postmaster [[John Stuart Skinner]], Judge [[Theodorick Bland (judge)|Theodorick Bland]] and Patent Office head [[William Thornton]]. Especially the support of Clay, who became a champion of Spanish American independence in [[United States Congress|Congress]], permitted him to lobby many influential officials.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n===Economic proposals===\n[[File:Ye Olde Mint,1792.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Robert Patterson (educator)|Robert Patterson]], director of the [[U.S. Mint]] (pictured in 1908), endorsed Torres' book.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|p=43}}]]\nTorres' lobbying included domestic affairs; in February{{nbsp}}1815, near the end of [[War of 1812]] that had preoccupied the American public, he wrote two letters to President Madison describing a proposal for fiscal and financial reform.<ref>Torres to Madison, February{{nbsp}}11, 1815, Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, James Madison Papers, {{hdl|loc.mss/mjm.17_0026_0028}} {{free access}}; Torres to Madison, February{{nbsp}}25, 1815, James Madison Papers, {{hdl|loc.mss/mjm.17_0157_0159}}{{free access}}.</ref> This included an equal and direct tax on all property, which Torres considered more just; ultimately he calculated a $1{{nbsp}}million budget surplus under his scheme and suggested gradual elimination of the national debt. In his December{{nbsp}}5 message to Congress, Madison did propose two ideas that Torres had favored: the establishment of a [[second Bank of the United States]] and utilizing it to create a uniform national currency.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe same year, Torres authored ''An Exposition of the Commerce of Spanish America; with some Observations upon its Importance to the United States''.<ref>{{harvtxt|On\u00eds|1952|pp=34\u201335}}, refers to this book as two separate works.</ref> This work, published in 1816, was the first inter-American handbook. Torres plays on Anglo-American rivalry by arguing for the importance of establishing American over British commercial interests in this critical region, just as revolutionary agents in Britain suggested the opposite.{{sfnp|Blaufarb|2007|p=759}} Applying [[political economy]], he observes that a country with a negative [[balance of trade]]\u2014like the United States\u2014needs a source of gold and silver ''[[bullion coin|specie]]''\u2014like South America\u2014to stabilize its currency and economy. The political commentary is interwoven with practical advice to merchants, followed by conversion tables between currencies and units of measure.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nHe momentarily returned to economics in April{{nbsp}}1818. Through Clay, Torres suggested to Congress that he had discovered a new way to make revenue collection and spending more efficient, which he would reveal in detail if he was promised a share of the government's savings. The preliminary proposal was referred to the [[House Committee on Ways and Means]], which declined to examine it for being too complex.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=109}}\n\n===Philadelphia junta===\nBy 1816, Spanish American propagandists had solidified American public opinion in favor of the Patriots. However, the propaganda victories did not translate into practical success: the Royalists [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|reconquered]] New Granada and Venezuela by May 1816. Pedro Jos\u00e9 Gual, who had come to the United States to represent those governments, instead worked with Torres on a plan to liberate New Spain. They were joined by a number of other agents to form a \"junta\" of their own, which included Orea, [[Mariano Montilla]], [[Jos\u00e9 Rafael Revenga]], [[Juan Germ\u00e1n Roscio]] from Venezuela, Miguel Santamar\u00eda from Mexico, as well as {{ill|Vicente Pazos|es|Vicente Pazos Kanki}} from Buenos Aires.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nThis Philadelphia junta surrounding Torres conspired in mid-1816 to invade a New Spanish port using ships commanded by French privateer [[Louis Aury]]. This plan failed because Aury's fleet was reduced to seven ships, making it unable to capture any major port. But the plotters were able to organize a force under the recently arrived General [[Francisco Xavier Mina]] (despite the obstructions of Jos\u00e9 Alvarez de Toledo, an acquaintance of Torres who was actually spying for On\u00eds). The operation was funded by a group of merchants from Baltimore, where Torres traveled to oversee it. The exiled priest [[Servando Teresa de Mier]] had traveled to the U.S. with Mina, and became a good friend of Torres. He brought to Mexico with him two copies of Torres' ''Exposition'' and one of the {{lang|es|Manual de un Republicano}}. The expedition sailed September 1816, but in just over a year Mina was captured and shot.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=44\u201348}}\n\n[[File:Elections Republic of Florida results.jpg|thumb|alt=Spanish-language poster prominently signed by Aury|Proclamation by Aury as \"Commander-in-chief of the Floridas\"]]\n\nAnother of the agents to join the junta was [[Lino de Clemente]], who in 1816 came to the United States as Venezuelan ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]'' (a diplomat of the lowest rank). Torres became his secretary in Philadelphia. Clemente was one of the men who signed [[Gregor MacGregor]]'s commission to seize [[Amelia Island]] off the coast of Florida, what became a political scandal known as the [[Amelia Island affair]]. All who had been involved became intolerable to Monroe.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nThe Philadelphia junta effectively disbanded because of the event, which Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar disavowed. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] refused any further communication with Clemente. Although Torres participated, he had discreetly avoided public involvement. (Privately he derided \"[[Don Quixote]]\" Aguirre and Pazos.)<ref>\"{{lang|es|Debemos tener presente lo que expuso Mr. Clay acerca de la incapacidad del Dn. Quixote Aguirre, y a\u00fan de Pazos.}}\" Torres to Juan Germ\u00e1n Roscio, April{{nbsp}}12, 1819, in {{harvp|Hern\u00e1ndez de Alba|1946|p=394}}.</ref> In October{{nbsp}}1818, Bol\u00edvar thus instructed Clemente to return home and to transfer his duties as ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' to Torres.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=51\u201352}}\n\n==Diplomat for Colombia==\n[[File:Batalla de Boyaca de Martin Tovar y Tovar.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting showing Patriot forces routing the Royalists|Patriot victory at the Battle of Boyac\u00e1]]\nTorres' appointment coincided with a turn in the wars of independence. Where before the situation had been dire, the Patriot forces under Bol\u00edvar began a [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|campaign to liberate New Granada]] and achieved a famous victory at the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]]. When Torres received his [[diplomatic credentials]] he was authorized to \"to do in the United States everything possible to put an immediate end to the conflict in which the patriots of Venezuela are now engaged for their independence and liberty.\" Venezuela and New Granada united on December{{nbsp}}17, 1819, to form the Republic of Colombia (a union called [[Gran Colombia]] by historians).{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|p=236}}\n\n[[Francisco Antonio Zea]] was first appointed Colombia's [[envoy (title)|envoy]] to the United States but never went there; Torres was authorized to take over his duties on May{{nbsp}}15, 1820, and thus formally empowered to negotiate for the republic. He would try to secure its independence by three methods: by purchasing weapons and other military supplies, by obtaining a loan, and by obtaining [[diplomatic recognition]] of its government.{{sfnp|Hern\u00e1ndez Delfino|2015|pp=70\u201372}}\n\n===Weapons purchases===\nWith the help of Samuel Douglas Forsyth, an American citizen sent from Venezuela by Bol\u00edvar, Torres was instructed to procure thirty thousand muskets on credit. This sum was not realistically available from private sources, in part due to the [[Panic of 1819]]. Torres did make substantial deals, especially with Philadelphia merchant [[Jacob Idler]], who represented a network of business associates.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|p=237}}\n\nIn one such contract, signed April{{nbsp}}4, 1819, Idler promised a total of $63,071.50 of supplies, including 4,023 muskets and 50 quintals{{efn-lr|The ''quintal'' is 100 Spanish pounds, in modern units approximately {{convert|101.514285714|lb|kg|1|adj=ri1}}.<!--The Spanish pound was 7106 English grains, compared to 7000 grains for an English pound.-->}} of gunpowder. After delivery Colombia was obliged to make payment in gold, silver or the tobacco produce of the [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]] province. More agreements on this model followed as merchants gained confidence with the news of successive Patriot victories. From December{{nbsp}}1819 to April{{nbsp}}1820 negotiated contracts worth $108,842.80 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|108842.8|1820|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US-GDP}}) and in the summer, Torres made a deal for the Colombian navy.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=237\u2013240}}\n\nAlthough Torres repeatedly wrote to his superiors about the great importance of maintaining Colombia's credit among American merchants, the government failed to make payment as agreed. In spite of this Torres was able to negotiate continued shipments, even with merchants who had unpaid claims.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=240\u2013242}} After independence, such claims became a significant problem of U.S. relations with South America; Idler's estate would litigate them up to the end of the century. Nevertheless, Torres obtained from Idler 11,571 muskets, and other supplies such as shoes and uniforms. They arrived in Venezuela in 1820\u20131821 aboard the ''Wilmot'' and ''Endymion''.{{sfnp|Grummond|1954|p=135}}\n\n[[File:James Monroe Cabinet.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of a Monroe cabinet meeting|Monroe's cabinet was initially divided over the proposed sale. (''The Birth of the Monroe Doctrine'' by [[Clyde O. DeLand]], 1912)]]\n\nIn February 1820, Torres came to Washington to purchase twenty thousand muskets from the U.S. government\u2014a source that could fill what he could not obtain from private merchants. Monroe delayed by responding that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] prevented him from selling weapons without the consent of Congress, but his cabinet considered a missive from Torres. This missive argued for the sale by emphasizing the common interests of the American republics against the European monarchies. Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Smith Thompson]] were supportive, and Torres had estimated the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was in his favor. However, Secretary of State Adams emphatically spoke against what he considered a violation of American [[neutral country|neutrality]], causing the cabinet to unanimously decline the request in a meeting on March{{nbsp}}29.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=242\u2013245}}\n\nThe next day Adams explained his feelings to Monroe:{{sfnp|Adams|1874\u20131877|loc=V, p.{{nbsp}}51}}\n{{blockquote|I felt some distrust of everything proposed and desired by these South American gentlemen. Mr. Torres and Mr. Forsyth had pursued a different system from that of Lino Clemente and Vicente Pazos. Instead of bullying and insulting, their course had been to soothe and coax. But their object was evidently the same. The proposal of Torres was that while professing neutrality we should furnish actual warlike aid to South America.}}\n\nDespite this skepticism, Adams trusted Torres to inform him on Spanish American affairs, perhaps because Torres was also strongly supportive of the United States. Torres made six repeat visits to Adams through February{{nbsp}}19, 1821, without success.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n===Attempted borrowing===\n[[File:Second Bank fo the United States 2.tiff|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of the building|The Second Bank of the United States (completed 1824)]]\nRecognizing the financial difficulty the Colombian government was in, Torres attempted to borrow money in the United States on its behalf. Aided by a letter of introduction from Henry Clay, in the fall of 1819 he proposed a $500,000 loan ({{Inflation|US-GDP|500000|1819|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US-GDP}}) to [[Langdon Cheves]], president of the Second Bank of the United States. It would be repaid with Colombian [[bullion]], which the Bank was severely short of, within 18 months. When the Bank stated it had no authority to lend to foreign governments, Torres restated his proposal as a {{em|purchase}} of bullion. He also contacted Adams, who said the government had no objection and left it to the Bank directors' judgment, and gained Cheves' support. Despite continued negotiation this loan was never finalized\u2014let alone Bol\u00edvar's bolder proposal for the Bank to take on the entirety of Venezuela's national debt in exchange for the [[Santa Ana de Mariquita]] silver mine in New Granada. Colombia had poor credit, and Torres believed the distressed Bank was actually unable to make the loan.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nTo improve Colombia's financial reputation Torres circulated several public memorials, and he continued to seek loans from other sources. Idler introduced him to Philip Contteau, the American agent of the Dutch merchant firm Mees, Boer and Moens. On April{{nbsp}}8, 1820, Torres and Contteau negotiated a loan of $4{{nbsp}}million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|4000000|1820|fmt=c|r=-3}}) at eight percent interest. Colombia would maintain a state monopoly on Barinas tobacco, and would give sole control of the tobacco to Mees, Boer and Moens until the proceeds had repaid the loan. These terms were sent to Colombia and Holland for approval.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=111}}\n\nTorres was instructed to borrow as much as $20{{nbsp}}million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|20000000|1820|fmt=c|r=-3}}), an impossible request.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=145}} He did hope to build on his success by borrowing an additional $1{{nbsp}}million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|1000000|1820|fmt=c|r=-3}}) with participation from the U.S. government. He made the request to Adams during the winter of 1820\u20131821, and obtained support from Monroe and Secretary of the Treasury [[William H. Crawford]]. However, like the weapons purchase, this proposal failed due to Adams' commitment to neutrality.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nThe loan in its original form was approved by the Colombian government, but before the Dutch lenders could agree to it Barinas was recaptured by the Royalists. Without the source of tobacco on which repayment depended, the bankers rejected the loan.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nThus, Torres was ultimately unable to borrow any money for Colombia. Historian Charles Bowman assessed Torres as a talented negotiator with an \"exceptional knowledge of high finance\", who failed due to circumstances beyond his control.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=114}}\n\n===Influence in pamphleteering===\n[[File:Frayservando.jpg|thumb|alt=Profile of Mier in priestly attire.|Servando Teresa de Mier]]\nIn June 1821, Mier returned to Philadelphia after escaping imprisonment in [[Havana]], and moved into Torres' house.{{efn-lr|{{harvtxt|Dom\u00ednguez Michael|2004|loc=p.{{nbsp}}600}} briefly mentions Torres having a wife and children with him, \"{{lang|es|su esposa Mariquita y sus hijos e hijas}}\", but no other authors do.}} (Another Spanish American agent, [[Vicente Rocafuerte]], was already living there.){{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=18}} Connected through [[Freemasonry]], Torres became a father figure to Mier, signing his letters {{lang|es|Tata T.}} He gradually drew Mier away from constitutional monarchism and toward the republican model of the United States. In doing so Torres tried to provide a political-philosophical basis for Mier's radicalism.{{sfnp|Dom\u00ednguez Michael|2004|pp=597\u2013610}} The pair encouraged Colombia to send a diplomat to Mexico, hoping to counter the [[First Mexican Empire|rising monarchism]] there.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=19}} When Mier published his {{lang|es|Memoria polit\u00edco-instructiva}} as well as a new edition of [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]]' {{lang|es|[[Brev\u00edsima relaci\u00f3n de la destrucci\u00f3n de las Indias]]}}, Torres paid the costs.{{sfnp|Vogeley|2011|p=86}}\n\nTorres, Mier and Rocafuerte worked together to publish numerous articles over the next few months. The nature of their cooperation is disputed. Historian Jos\u00e9 de On\u00eds mentions that \"some Spanish American critics assert that Torres' works are generally regarded as having been written by Mier and Vicente Rocafuerte. This would be hard to verify.\"{{sfnp|On\u00eds|1952|p=35}} But Charles Bowman gives the opposite interpretation: \"It is likely that several of the works generally attributed to either Mier or Rocafuerte were actually from Torres' pen.\"{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=19}}\n\nIn particular, Bowman believes a pamphlet bearing Mier's name, {{lang|es|La Am\u00e9rica Espa\u00f1ola dividida en dos grande departamentos, Norte y Sur o sea Septentrional y Meridional}}, was actually Torres' work. Discussing political organization after the revolution, the author suggests a \"Spanish America Divided in Two Grand Departments, North and South, or Septentrional and Meridional.\" Bowman bases this attribution on a moderation uncommon for Mier, and the use of statistics Mier would not have known. Torres' motive for publishing it under Mier's name would have been to avoid controversy and thus protect his influence with Adams.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nDuring this period Torres also became friends with [[Richard Worsam Meade I|Richard W. Meade]], a Philadelphia merchant who had in 1820 returned from imprisonment in Spain. He had a claim against the Spanish government that the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] required him to collect from the U.S. government instead. Meade was a pewholder of St. Mary's Church, like Torres. Through the diplomat, Mier and Meade began working together in a controversy surrounding the parish priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], who had been [[excommunicated]]. Torres did not get publicly involved in the battle of pamphlets; Mier left Philadelphia for Mexico in September 1821, traveling with a Colombian passport Torres had issued him.<ref>{{harvp|Bowman|1969|pp=20\u201322}}; for more on this controversy see {{harvp|Warren|2004}}.</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic recognition===\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta IX - Guerras de independencia en Colombia, 1821-1823.jpg|thumb|alt=Map covering modern Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela|The great extent of Colombia, [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]] (former New Granada) highlighted]]\n\nOn the same day the [[U.S. Senate]] voted to ratify the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, February{{nbsp}}19, 1821, Torres met with Adams. The next day he formally requested the recognition of Colombia \"as a free and independent nation, a sister republic\". He expected that first the United States would take possession of the new territory, while in the meantime Colombia gained increasing military control over its own, and that recognition would soon follow.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nTorres suffered a three-month illness in late 1821 but on November{{nbsp}}30 wrote to Adams reporting the latest developments in Colombia. He glorified its achievement of near-total military victory, the extent of its population and territory, and its potential for commerce:{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=23}}\n{{blockquote|She also unites by prolonged canals, two oceans which nature has separated; and by her proximity to the United States and to Europe, appears to have been destined by the Author of Nature as the centre and empire of the human family.}}\nThe purpose of these boasts was to underscore the importance of the U.S. being the first to recognize its independence, to which Torres added warnings about the unstable politics of Mexico and Peru. The letter received significant publicity because of its extensive information and ambitious statement of Colombia's importance.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nPresident Monroe noted the success of Colombia and the other former colonies in his December{{nbsp}}3 message to Congress, a signal that recognition was imminent. Torres wrote letters to Adams on December{{nbsp}}30 and January{{nbsp}}2 reporting [[Colombian Constitution of 1821|Colombia's new constitution]], a sign the republic was stable. He hoped to go to Washington to state the case for recognition in person, but was prevented by illness and poverty. The House of Representatives asked the administration on January{{nbsp}}30 to report on the state of South America. Colombia's ''de facto'' independence as a republic, and the conclusion of Adams' treaty with Spain, encouraged the hesitant administration that the time was ripe for recognition. During this same period, the Colombian government was starting to see the prospect of recognition as hopeless.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nTorres' health declined intermittently over the winter; his weakening disposition was attributed to asthma and severe overwork.{{sfnmp|1a1=Bowman|1y=1969|1pp=26\u201327|2a1=Bowman|2y=1970|2p=53}} \"If I could move to a good climate where there were no books, paper, or pen and where I could speak of politics in a  word, ... with my little garden and a horse to carry me about, perhaps I could convalesce\", he wrote to Mier.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=30}} But in March, Monroe reported to the House that the Spanish American governments had \"a claim to recognition by other powers which ought not to be resisted.\" The formerly reluctant Adams dismissed a protest by Spanish minister Joaqu\u00edn de Anduaga by calling the recognition \"the mere acknowledgment of existing facts\". By May{{nbsp}}4, the House and Senate had sent Monroe resolutions in support of recognition and an appropriation to put this into effect; this news was greatly celebrated in Colombia.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=27\u201329}} Pedro Jos\u00e9 Gual, now the Colombian secretary of state and foreign relations, wrote to Bol\u00edvar that Torres deserved sole credit for the achievement.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=29}}\n\nThe question remained when to send ministers and whom to recognize first. At this time, Torres was the only authorized agent in the United States for any of the Patriot governments.{{sfnp|Robertson|1915|p=189}} It was Adams' suggestion that Torres should be received as ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' immediately, with the United States reciprocating after other diplomats arrived; Monroe agreed to thus formalize his existing relationship with Torres. The ''charg\u00e9'' was invited on May{{nbsp}}23 but delayed by his poor health. Nevertheless, he insisted on traveling to Washington.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nAt 1{{nbsp}}p.m. on June{{nbsp}}19, Torres was received at the [[White House]] by Adams and Monroe. The weakened Torres told them of the importance of recognition to Colombia, and wept when the President said how satisfied he was for Torres to be received as its first representative. Indeed, he was the first representative from any Spanish American government. On leaving the short meeting, Torres gave Adams a print of the Colombian constitution.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=31}}\n\nBefore Torres departed Washington, Adams visited him on June{{nbsp}}21; he promised Adams to work for equal tariffs on American and European goods in Colombia, and predicted {{ill|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Salazar|es}} would be sent to the U.S. as permanent diplomat. Adams published a satisfied announcement in the ''[[National Intelligencer]]''.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n==Death==\nIn rapidly declining health, Torres returned to [[Hamilton Village, Philadelphia|Hamiltonville]], now in [[West Philadelphia]], where that spring he had purchased a new home. Duane was with him when he died there at 2{{nbsp}}p.m. on July{{nbsp}}15, 1822, at age{{nbsp}}59.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=32}}\n\nOn July{{nbsp}}17, the funeral procession began from Meade's house, which was joined by Commodore Daniels of the Colombian navy and prominent citizens. The procession went to St.{{nbsp}}Mary's, where the requiem mass was held by Father Hogan and Torres was buried with [[military honors]]. Ships in the harbor held their flags at half-mast. {{sfnmp|1a1=Bowman|1y=1968|1p=245|2a1=Bowman|2y=1970|2p=53}} This highly unusual display of honor was not only because Torres was well-liked, but also because he was the first foreign diplomat to die in the United States.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=38}} An obituary named him \"the [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] of South America\".<ref>''New York Evening Post'', [https://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/objects/8158 \"The Franklin of South America\"], 1822, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Simon Gratz collection.

He is best known for being received as the first [[List of ambassadors of Colombia to the United States|ambassador of Colombia]] by U.S. President [[James Monroe]] on June{{nbsp}}19, 1822. This act represented the first U.S. recognition of a former Spanish colony's independence.\n\nBorn in Spain, he lived as a young adult in the colony of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (present-day Colombia). After being implicated in a conspiracy against the monarchy he fled in 1794, arriving in the United States in 1796. From [[Philadelphia]] he spent the rest of his life advocating for independence of the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Working closely with newspaper editor [[William Duane (journalist)|William Duane]] he produced English- and Spanish-language articles, pamphlets and books.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] he was a central figure in directing the work of revolutionary agents in North America, who frequently visited his home. In 1819 Torres was appointed a diplomat for Venezuela, which that year united with New Granada to form [[Gran Colombia]]. As ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]'' he negotiated significant weapons purchases but failed to obtain public loans. Having laid the groundwork for the [[diplomatic recognition]] of Colombia, he died less than a month after achieving this goal. Though largely unknown today, he is remembered as an early proponent of [[Pan-Americanism]].\n\n==Early life==\nManuel Torres was born in the Spanish [[Kingdom of C\u00f3rdoba|region of C\u00f3rdoba]] in early November 1762.{{efn-lr|Some sources, including the plaque at St. Mary's, give 1764 instead. {{harvtxt|Bowman|1971b|loc=p.{{nbsp}}440 n.{{nbsp}}5}} derives the 1762 birthday from two letters Torres wrote Mier in 1821: on October{{nbsp}}31 he said he was aged 58, on November{{nbsp}}18 he said he was 59.}} His mother's family was from the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|city of C\u00f3rdoba]] while his father's side was probably from nearby [[Baena]]. He was descended from the minor nobility on both sides of his family, a class with social stature but not necessarily wealth.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\n[[File:Antonio Caballero y G\u00f3ngora.jpg|thumb|Antonio Caballero y G\u00f3ngora, Torres' uncle]]\n\nIn the spring of 1776 the young Torres sailed to Cuba with his maternal uncle [[Antonio Caballero y G\u00f3ngora]], who was consecrated there as bishop of [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (modern Mexico). Torres would later attribute his republican ideals to his uncle, a man of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who was an extensive collector of books, art, and coins. After Caballero y G\u00f3ngora was promoted to archbishop of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]] the family arrived in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] (modern Colombia) on June 29, 1778.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=417\u2013418}}\n\nAt age 17 Torres began working for the secretariat of the Viceroyalty and for the royal treasury. In the following seven years he learned finance and was able to observe the political and social conflicts in New Grenada, including the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]]. This was also the time of the [[American Revolution]], which [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Spain joined against Great Britain]]. Caballero y G\u00f3ngora became viceroy in 1782 and ruled as a liberal modernizer.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=423\u2013424}}\n\nTorres went to France in early 1785 to study at the {{ill|Sor\u00e8ze abbey|lt=\u00c9cole Royale Militaire at Sor\u00e8ze|fr|Abbaye de Sor\u00e8ze}}, where he spent about a year and half learning [[military science]] and mathematics. As lieutenant of engineers ({{lang-es|teniente de ingenerios}}) he probably aided Colonel [[Domingo Esquiaqui]]'s survey and helped reorganize the colonial garrisons.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=429\u2013431}} On presentation by the archbishop-viceroy, Torres was gifted land near [[Santa Marta]] by [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles{{nbsp}}IV]] and established a successful plantation, which he named San Carlos.{{efn-lr|{{harvtxt|Duane|1826|p=609}} described what he heard of the ruined plantation in 1823, suggesting what it used to be like: {{quote|I enquired; and learned there was not a vestige of a habitation: the forests which [Torres] had felled, and the gardens laid out and cultivated under his own eye, in which were collected and collecting all the riches of the botanical regions; the avenues of cotton trees and oranges, the groves of foreign firs on the lofty peaks, and the palms in the valleys, had lost their order and disposition[.]|}}}} Torres married and at San Carlos had a daughter.{{sfnp|Duane|1826|p=608}}{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=435\u2013437}}\n\nHe became involved with political liberals of Bogot\u00e1's {{lang|es|[[Criollo people|criollo]]}} class (i.e., native New Granadians of European descent), joining a secret club led by [[Antonio Nari\u00f1o]] where radical ideas were discussed freely. When in 1794 Nari\u00f1o and other club members were implicated in a conspiracy against the Crown, Torres fled New Granada without his family. He first went to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and in 1796 to [[Philadelphia]],<ref>1797 is given by {{harvtxt|On\u00eds|1952|p=34}}; but for 1796 see {{harvp|Bemis|1939|p=21}}; {{harvp|Hern\u00e1ndez de Alba|1946|p=368}}; {{harvp|Bowman|1970|p=26}}.</ref> then the capital of the United States.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971b|pp=434\u2013439}}\n\n===Arrival in Philadelphia===\nSpanish Americans heading north tended to go to Philadelphia, Baltimore or (French-controlled) New Orleans, centers of commercial relations with the colonies. Philadelphia in particular was a symbol of republican ideals, which may have attracted Torres. Its trade with the Spanish colonies was significant and the [[American Philosophical Society]] was the first learned society in the U.S. to nominate Spanish American members.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=26\u201327}} At [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St.{{nbsp}}Mary's Church]] he joined a cosmopolitan community of Roman Catholics, including many from Spanish and French America.{{sfnp|Warren|2004|pp=344\u2013347}}\n\n[[File:William Duane.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Engraving of Duane in profile|Influenced by Torres, William Duane and his ''Aurora'' became advocates for Spanish American independence.]]\n\nQuick to make American contacts, Torres became close friends with William Duane, who became editor of the Philadelphia newspaper ''[[Philadelphia Aurora|Aurora]]'' in 1798. The editor continually published Torres' views on Spanish American independence in the paper, whose contents would be copied by others. Torres translated Spanish [[pamphlets]] for Duane, and sometimes translated Duane's editorials to Spanish.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=40\u201341}} In Spanish America the purpose of this literature was to praise the United States as an example of independent [[representative government]] to be emulated; in the United States it was to increase support for the independence movements.{{sfnp|On\u00eds|1952|p=34}}\n\nInitially Torres was quite wealthy and received remittances from his wife, which helped him make important social connections. However, he had his money invested in risky merchant ventures; on one occasion he lost $40,000, on another $70,000\u2014thus he was forced to live more modestly in later years.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nThree years after Torres' arrival, a \"Spaniard in Philadelphia\" wrote the pamphlet ''{{lang|es|Reflexiones sobre el comercio de Espa\u00f1a con sus colonias en tiempo de guerra}}'' (released in English as ''Observations on the Commerce of Spain with her Colonies, in Time of War''). The author, probably Torres, criticizes Spanish colonialism. In particular, Spain monopolized trade with the colonies to their detriment: during wartime the mother country could not supply the colonies with essential goods, and in peacetime the prices were too high. The author's solution is to implement a system of [[free trade]] in the Americas.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=29\u201330}} The pamphlet was reprinted in London by [[William Tatham]].{{sfnp|Morrison|1922|p=84}}\n\nTorres' residence increased the attraction of Philadelphia for Spanish American revolutionaries. Torres probably met [[Francisco de Miranda]] (also exiled after a failed conspiracy) in 1805, shortly before Miranda's failed expedition to the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]], and he met with [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1806. The Spanish minister to the United States, [[Carlos Mart\u00ednez de Irujo, 1st Marquess of Casa Irujo|Carlos Mart\u00ednez de Irujo]],{{efn-lr|The seat of government moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1800, but the Spanish ministers continued to reside in Philadelphia.}} reported Torres' activity to his superiors.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Coordinating revolutionaries==\nDuring the instability caused by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquest of Spain\u2014the [[Peninsular War]]\u2014the people of the colonies followed the model of Peninsular Spanish provinces by organizing [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|juntas]] to govern in the absence of central rule. Advocates of independence, who called themselves Patriots, argued that sovereignty reverted to the people when there was no monarch. They clashed with the [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|Royalists]], who supported the authority of the Crown. Starting in 1810 the Patriot juntas successively declared independence, and Torres was their natural point of contact in the United States.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=31\u201333}}\n\n===Brokered weapons shipments===\nAlthough President [[James Madison]]'s administration officially recognized no governments on either side, Patriot agents were permitted to seek weapons in the U.S., and American ports became bases for [[privateering]]. Torres acted as an intermediary between the newly arrived agents and influential Americans, such as introducing {{ill|Juan Vicente Bol\u00edvar|es|Juan Vicente Bol\u00edvar Palacios}} (Sim\u00f3n's brother) to wealthy banker [[Stephen Girard]]. Juan Vicente successfully purchased weapons for Venezuela, but was lost at sea on his return journey in 1811.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|p=34}}\n\nTogether with Tel\u00e9sforo de Orea from Venezuela, and Diego de Saavadra and [[Juan Pedro Aguirre|Juan Pedro de Aguirre]] from Buenos Aires, Torres brokered a plan to purchase 20,000 muskets and bayonets from the U.S. government. Girard agreed to finance the plan on the joint credit of Buenos Aires and Venezuela, but Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] blocked it by refusing to reply. Savaadra and Aguirre managed to ship only 1,000 muskets to Buenos Aires, but by the end of 1811 Torres had helped Orea supply Venezuela with about 24,000 weapons. New purchasers continued to arrive, and the supplies were an important contribution while the revolutionaries were suffering many defeats.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=35\u201338}}\n\nThe new Spanish minister, [[Lu\u00eds de On\u00eds]], covertly attempted to disrupt the weapons shipments. He became aware of the plan to purchase from the U.S. arsenal due to being informed by a postman. On\u00eds reported on these subversive activities and his agents harassed suspected revolutionaries like Torres. Francisco Sarmiento and Miguel Cabral de Noro\u00f1a, two associates of On\u00eds, attempted to assassinate Torres in 1814\u2014apparently on the minister's orders.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|p=39}} Due to his aid for the revolution, Torres' estate in Royalist-controlled New Granada was confiscated after his wife and daughter died.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n===Public writing===\nRunning out of money during this period, Torres sustained himself in part by teaching. With [[Louis Hargous]] he wrote an adaptation for both English- and Spanish-teaching of [[Nicolas Gou\u00efn Dufief]]'s ''Nature Displayed in Her Mode of Teaching Language to Man''. The lengthy book's title page styles Torres and Hargous as \"professors of general grammar\"; in the introduction they argue the importance to Americans of studying Spanish literature.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=32\u201333}} Influential revised editions by [[Mariano Vel\u00e1zquez de la Cadena]] were published in New York (1825) and London (1826).{{sfnp|Vilar|2001|pp=245\u2013249}}\n\nSoon after ''Nature Displayed'' followed the 1812 pamphlet ''{{lang|es|Manual de un Republicano para el uso de un Pueblo libre}}'' (\"A Republican's Manual for the Use of a Free People\"), which Torres probably wrote. Structured as a dialog, the anonymous pamphlet offers a defense of the U.S. system of government based on the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and argues it should be a model for Spanish America. The contents suggest the author is \"a conservative partisan of [[Jeffersonian democracy]]\".<ref>{{harvtxt|On\u00eds|1952|p=35}} writes Torres' authorship \"is possible\"; {{harvtxt|Bowman|1970|pp=41\u201342}} writes he \"probably\" wrote it and infers Torres' Jeffersonianism.</ref>\n\nBesides Duane's ''Aurora'', Torres sent news and opinion to [[Baptis Irvine]]'s Baltimore ''Whig'' and New York ''Columbian'', [[Jonathan Elliot (historian)|Jonathan Elliot]]'s ''City of Washington Gazette'', and [[Hezekiah Niles]]' Baltimore ''Weekly Register''. He acquainted himself with notables such as Congressman [[Henry Clay]], lawyer [[Henry Marie Brackenridge]], Baltimore Postmaster [[John Stuart Skinner]], Judge [[Theodorick Bland (judge)|Theodorick Bland]] and Patent Office head [[William Thornton]]. Especially the support of Clay, who became a champion of Spanish American independence in [[United States Congress|Congress]], permitted him to lobby many influential officials.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n===Economic proposals===\n[[File:Ye Olde Mint,1792.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Robert Patterson (educator)|Robert Patterson]], director of the [[U.S. Mint]] (pictured in 1908), endorsed Torres' book.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|p=43}}]]\nTorres' lobbying included domestic affairs; in February{{nbsp}}1815, near the end of [[War of 1812]] that had preoccupied the American public, he wrote two letters to President Madison describing a proposal for fiscal and financial reform.<ref>Torres to Madison, February{{nbsp}}11, 1815, Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, James Madison Papers, {{hdl|loc.mss/mjm.17_0026_0028}} {{free access}}; Torres to Madison, February{{nbsp}}25, 1815, James Madison Papers, {{hdl|loc.mss/mjm.17_0157_0159}}{{free access}}.</ref> This included an equal and direct tax on all property, which Torres considered more just; ultimately he calculated a $1{{nbsp}}million budget surplus under his scheme and suggested gradual elimination of the national debt. In his December{{nbsp}}5 message to Congress, Madison did propose two ideas that Torres had favored: the establishment of a [[second Bank of the United States]] and utilizing it to create a uniform national currency.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe same year, Torres authored ''An Exposition of the Commerce of Spanish America; with some Observations upon its Importance to the United States''.<ref>{{harvtxt|On\u00eds|1952|pp=34\u201335}}, refers to this book as two separate works.</ref> This work, published in 1816, was the first inter-American handbook. Torres plays on Anglo-American rivalry by arguing for the importance of establishing American over British commercial interests in this critical region, just as revolutionary agents in Britain suggested the opposite.{{sfnp|Blaufarb|2007|p=759}} Applying [[political economy]], he observes that a country with a negative [[balance of trade]]\u2014like the United States\u2014needs a source of gold and silver ''[[bullion coin|specie]]''\u2014like South America\u2014to stabilize its currency and economy. The political commentary is interwoven with practical advice to merchants, followed by conversion tables between currencies and units of measure.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nHe momentarily returned to economics in April{{nbsp}}1818. Through Clay, Torres suggested to Congress that he had discovered a new way to make revenue collection and spending more efficient, which he would reveal in detail if he was promised a share of the government's savings. The preliminary proposal was referred to the [[House Committee on Ways and Means]], which declined to examine it for being too complex.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=109}}\n\n===Philadelphia junta===\nBy 1816, Spanish American propagandists had solidified American public opinion in favor of the Patriots. However, the propaganda victories did not translate into practical success: the Royalists [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada|reconquered]] New Granada and Venezuela by May 1816. Pedro Jos\u00e9 Gual, who had come to the United States to represent those governments, instead worked with Torres on a plan to liberate New Spain. They were joined by a number of other agents to form a \"junta\" of their own, which included Orea, [[Mariano Montilla]], [[Jos\u00e9 Rafael Revenga]], [[Juan Germ\u00e1n Roscio]] from Venezuela, Miguel Santamar\u00eda from Mexico, as well as {{ill|Vicente Pazos|es|Vicente Pazos Kanki}} from Buenos Aires.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nThis Philadelphia junta surrounding Torres conspired in mid-1816 to invade a New Spanish port using ships commanded by French privateer [[Louis Aury]]. This plan failed because Aury's fleet was reduced to seven ships, making it unable to capture any major port. But the plotters were able to organize a force under the recently arrived General [[Francisco Xavier Mina]] (despite the obstructions of Jos\u00e9 Alvarez de Toledo, an acquaintance of Torres who was actually spying for On\u00eds). The operation was funded by a group of merchants from Baltimore, where Torres traveled to oversee it. The exiled priest [[Servando Teresa de Mier]] had traveled to the U.S. with Mina, and became a good friend of Torres. He brought to Mexico with him two copies of Torres' ''Exposition'' and one of the {{lang|es|Manual de un Republicano}}. The expedition sailed September 1816, but in just over a year Mina was captured and shot.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=44\u201348}}\n\n[[File:Elections Republic of Florida results.jpg|thumb|alt=Spanish-language poster prominently signed by Aury|Proclamation by Aury as \"Commander-in-chief of the Floridas\"]]\n\nAnother of the agents to join the junta was [[Lino de Clemente]], who in 1816 came to the United States as Venezuelan ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]'' (a diplomat of the lowest rank). Torres became his secretary in Philadelphia. Clemente was one of the men who signed [[Gregor MacGregor]]'s commission to seize [[Amelia Island]] off the coast of Florida, what became a political scandal known as the [[Amelia Island affair]]. All who had been involved became intolerable to Monroe.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nThe Philadelphia junta effectively disbanded because of the event, which Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar disavowed. Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] refused any further communication with Clemente. Although Torres participated, he had discreetly avoided public involvement. (Privately he derided \"[[Don Quixote]]\" Aguirre and Pazos.)<ref>\"{{lang|es|Debemos tener presente lo que expuso Mr. Clay acerca de la incapacidad del Dn. Quixote Aguirre, y a\u00fan de Pazos.}}\" Torres to Juan Germ\u00e1n Roscio, April{{nbsp}}12, 1819, in {{harvp|Hern\u00e1ndez de Alba|1946|p=394}}.</ref> In October{{nbsp}}1818, Bol\u00edvar thus instructed Clemente to return home and to transfer his duties as ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' to Torres.{{sfnp|Bowman|1970|pp=51\u201352}}\n\n==Diplomat for Colombia==\n[[File:Batalla de Boyaca de Martin Tovar y Tovar.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting showing Patriot forces routing the Royalists|Patriot victory at the Battle of Boyac\u00e1]]\nTorres' appointment coincided with a turn in the wars of independence. Where before the situation had been dire, the Patriot forces under Bol\u00edvar began a [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|campaign to liberate New Granada]] and achieved a famous victory at the [[Battle of Boyac\u00e1]]. When Torres received his [[diplomatic credentials]] he was authorized to \"to do in the United States everything possible to put an immediate end to the conflict in which the patriots of Venezuela are now engaged for their independence and liberty.\" Venezuela and New Granada united on December{{nbsp}}17, 1819, to form the Republic of Colombia (a union called [[Gran Colombia]] by historians).{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|p=236}}\n\n[[Francisco Antonio Zea]] was first appointed Colombia's [[envoy (title)|envoy]] to the United States but never went there; Torres was authorized to take over his duties on May{{nbsp}}15, 1820, and thus formally empowered to negotiate for the republic. He would try to secure its independence by three methods: by purchasing weapons and other military supplies, by obtaining a loan, and by obtaining [[diplomatic recognition]] of its government.{{sfnp|Hern\u00e1ndez Delfino|2015|pp=70\u201372}}\n\n===Weapons purchases===\nWith the help of Samuel Douglas Forsyth, an American citizen sent from Venezuela by Bol\u00edvar, Torres was instructed to procure thirty thousand muskets on credit. This sum was not realistically available from private sources, in part due to the [[Panic of 1819]]. Torres did make substantial deals, especially with Philadelphia merchant [[Jacob Idler]], who represented a network of business associates.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|p=237}}\n\nIn one such contract, signed April{{nbsp}}4, 1819, Idler promised a total of $63,071.50 of supplies, including 4,023 muskets and 50 quintals{{efn-lr|The ''quintal'' is 100 Spanish pounds, in modern units approximately {{convert|101.514285714|lb|kg|1|adj=ri1}}.<!--The Spanish pound was 7106 English grains, compared to 7000 grains for an English pound.-->}} of gunpowder. After delivery Colombia was obliged to make payment in gold, silver or the tobacco produce of the [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]] province. More agreements on this model followed as merchants gained confidence with the news of successive Patriot victories. From December{{nbsp}}1819 to April{{nbsp}}1820 negotiated contracts worth $108,842.80 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|108842.8|1820|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US-GDP}}) and in the summer, Torres made a deal for the Colombian navy.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=237\u2013240}}\n\nAlthough Torres repeatedly wrote to his superiors about the great importance of maintaining Colombia's credit among American merchants, the government failed to make payment as agreed. In spite of this Torres was able to negotiate continued shipments, even with merchants who had unpaid claims.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=240\u2013242}} After independence, such claims became a significant problem of U.S. relations with South America; Idler's estate would litigate them up to the end of the century. Nevertheless, Torres obtained from Idler 11,571 muskets, and other supplies such as shoes and uniforms. They arrived in Venezuela in 1820\u20131821 aboard the ''Wilmot'' and ''Endymion''.{{sfnp|Grummond|1954|p=135}}\n\n[[File:James Monroe Cabinet.jpg|thumb|alt=Illustration of a Monroe cabinet meeting|Monroe's cabinet was initially divided over the proposed sale. (''The Birth of the Monroe Doctrine'' by [[Clyde O. DeLand]], 1912)]]\n\nIn February 1820, Torres came to Washington to purchase twenty thousand muskets from the U.S. government\u2014a source that could fill what he could not obtain from private merchants. Monroe delayed by responding that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] prevented him from selling weapons without the consent of Congress, but his cabinet considered a missive from Torres. This missive argued for the sale by emphasizing the common interests of the American republics against the European monarchies. Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Smith Thompson]] were supportive, and Torres had estimated the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was in his favor. However, Secretary of State Adams emphatically spoke against what he considered a violation of American [[neutral country|neutrality]], causing the cabinet to unanimously decline the request in a meeting on March{{nbsp}}29.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=242\u2013245}}\n\nThe next day Adams explained his feelings to Monroe:{{sfnp|Adams|1874\u20131877|loc=V, p.{{nbsp}}51}}\n{{blockquote|I felt some distrust of everything proposed and desired by these South American gentlemen. Mr. Torres and Mr. Forsyth had pursued a different system from that of Lino Clemente and Vicente Pazos. Instead of bullying and insulting, their course had been to soothe and coax. But their object was evidently the same. The proposal of Torres was that while professing neutrality we should furnish actual warlike aid to South America.}}\n\nDespite this skepticism, Adams trusted Torres to inform him on Spanish American affairs, perhaps because Torres was also strongly supportive of the United States. Torres made six repeat visits to Adams through February{{nbsp}}19, 1821, without success.{{sfnp|Bowman|1968|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n===Attempted borrowing===\n[[File:Second Bank fo the United States 2.tiff|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of the building|The Second Bank of the United States (completed 1824)]]\nRecognizing the financial difficulty the Colombian government was in, Torres attempted to borrow money in the United States on its behalf. Aided by a letter of introduction from Henry Clay, in the fall of 1819 he proposed a $500,000 loan ({{Inflation|US-GDP|500000|1819|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US-GDP}}) to [[Langdon Cheves]], president of the Second Bank of the United States. It would be repaid with Colombian [[bullion]], which the Bank was severely short of, within 18 months. When the Bank stated it had no authority to lend to foreign governments, Torres restated his proposal as a {{em|purchase}} of bullion. He also contacted Adams, who said the government had no objection and left it to the Bank directors' judgment, and gained Cheves' support. Despite continued negotiation this loan was never finalized\u2014let alone Bol\u00edvar's bolder proposal for the Bank to take on the entirety of Venezuela's national debt in exchange for the [[Santa Ana de Mariquita]] silver mine in New Granada. Colombia had poor credit, and Torres believed the distressed Bank was actually unable to make the loan.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nTo improve Colombia's financial reputation Torres circulated several public memorials, and he continued to seek loans from other sources. Idler introduced him to Philip Contteau, the American agent of the Dutch merchant firm Mees, Boer and Moens. On April{{nbsp}}8, 1820, Torres and Contteau negotiated a loan of $4{{nbsp}}million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|4000000|1820|fmt=c|r=-3}}) at eight percent interest. Colombia would maintain a state monopoly on Barinas tobacco, and would give sole control of the tobacco to Mees, Boer and Moens until the proceeds had repaid the loan. These terms were sent to Colombia and Holland for approval.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=111}}\n\nTorres was instructed to borrow as much as $20{{nbsp}}million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|20000000|1820|fmt=c|r=-3}}), an impossible request.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=145}} He did hope to build on his success by borrowing an additional $1{{nbsp}}million (${{Inflation|US-GDP|1000000|1820|fmt=c|r=-3}}) with participation from the U.S. government. He made the request to Adams during the winter of 1820\u20131821, and obtained support from Monroe and Secretary of the Treasury [[William H. Crawford]]. However, like the weapons purchase, this proposal failed due to Adams' commitment to neutrality.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nThe loan in its original form was approved by the Colombian government, but before the Dutch lenders could agree to it Barinas was recaptured by the Royalists. Without the source of tobacco on which repayment depended, the bankers rejected the loan.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\nThus, Torres was ultimately unable to borrow any money for Colombia. Historian Charles Bowman assessed Torres as a talented negotiator with an \"exceptional knowledge of high finance\", who failed due to circumstances beyond his control.{{sfnp|Bowman|1971a|p=114}}\n\n===Influence in pamphleteering===\n[[File:Frayservando.jpg|thumb|alt=Profile of Mier in priestly attire.|Servando Teresa de Mier]]\nIn June 1821, Mier returned to Philadelphia after escaping imprisonment in [[Havana]], and moved into Torres' house.{{efn-lr|{{harvtxt|Dom\u00ednguez Michael|2004|loc=p.{{nbsp}}600}} briefly mentions Torres having a wife and children with him, \"{{lang|es|su esposa Mariquita y sus hijos e hijas}}\", but no other authors do.}} (Another Spanish American agent, [[Vicente Rocafuerte]], was already living there.){{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=18}} Connected through [[Freemasonry]], Torres became a father figure to Mier, signing his letters {{lang|es|Tata T.}} He gradually drew Mier away from constitutional monarchism and toward the republican model of the United States.

The nature of their cooperation is disputed. Historian Jos\u00e9 de On\u00eds mentions that \"some Spanish American critics assert that Torres' works are generally regarded as having been written by Mier and Vicente Rocafuerte. This would be hard to verify.\"{{sfnp|On\u00eds|1952|p=35}} But Charles Bowman gives the opposite interpretation: \"It is likely that several of the works generally attributed to either Mier or Rocafuerte were actually from Torres' pen.\"{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=19}}\n\nIn particular, Bowman believes a pamphlet bearing Mier's name, {{lang|es|La Am\u00e9rica Espa\u00f1ola dividida en dos grande departamentos, Norte y Sur o sea Septentrional y Meridional}}, was actually Torres' work. Discussing political organization after the revolution, the author suggests a \"Spanish America Divided in Two Grand Departments, North and South, or Septentrional and Meridional.\" Bowman bases this attribution on a moderation uncommon for Mier, and the use of statistics Mier would not have known. Torres' motive for publishing it under Mier's name would have been to avoid controversy and thus protect his influence with Adams.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nDuring this period Torres also became friends with [[Richard Worsam Meade I|Richard W. Meade]], a Philadelphia merchant who had in 1820 returned from imprisonment in Spain. He had a claim against the Spanish government that the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] required him to collect from the U.S. government instead. Meade was a pewholder of St. Mary's Church, like Torres. Through the diplomat, Mier and Meade began working together in a controversy surrounding the parish priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], who had been [[excommunicated]]. Torres did not get publicly involved in the battle of pamphlets; Mier left Philadelphia for Mexico in September 1821, traveling with a Colombian passport Torres had issued him.<ref>{{harvp|Bowman|1969|pp=20\u201322}}; for more on this controversy see {{harvp|Warren|2004}}.</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic recognition===\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta IX - Guerras de independencia en Colombia, 1821-1823.jpg|thumb|alt=Map covering modern Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela|The great extent of Colombia, [[Cundinamarca Department (1820)|Cundinamarca]] (former New Granada) highlighted]]\n\nOn the same day the [[U.S. Senate]] voted to ratify the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, February{{nbsp}}19, 1821, Torres met with Adams. The next day he formally requested the recognition of Colombia \"as a free and independent nation, a sister republic\". He expected that first the United States would take possession of the new territory, while in the meantime Colombia gained increasing military control over its own, and that recognition would soon follow.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nTorres suffered a three-month illness in late 1821 but on November{{nbsp}}30 wrote to Adams reporting the latest developments in Colombia. He glorified its achievement of near-total military victory, the extent of its population and territory, and its potential for commerce:{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=23}}\n{{blockquote|She also unites by prolonged canals, two oceans which nature has separated; and by her proximity to the United States and to Europe, appears to have been destined by the Author of Nature as the centre and empire of the human family.}}\nThe purpose of these boasts was to underscore the importance of the U.S. being the first to recognize its independence, to which Torres added warnings about the unstable politics of Mexico and Peru. The letter received significant publicity because of its extensive information and ambitious statement of Colombia's importance.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nPresident Monroe noted the success of Colombia and the other former colonies in his December{{nbsp}}3 message to Congress, a signal that recognition was imminent. Torres wrote letters to Adams on December{{nbsp}}30 and January{{nbsp}}2 reporting [[Colombian Constitution of 1821|Colombia's new constitution]], a sign the republic was stable. He hoped to go to Washington to state the case for recognition in person, but was prevented by illness and poverty. The House of Representatives asked the administration on January{{nbsp}}30 to report on the state of South America. Colombia's ''de facto'' independence as a republic, and the conclusion of Adams' treaty with Spain, encouraged the hesitant administration that the time was ripe for recognition. During this same period, the Colombian government was starting to see the prospect of recognition as hopeless.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nTorres' health declined intermittently over the winter; his weakening disposition was attributed to asthma and severe overwork.{{sfnmp|1a1=Bowman|1y=1969|1pp=26\u201327|2a1=Bowman|2y=1970|2p=53}} \"If I could move to a good climate where there were no books, paper, or pen and where I could speak of politics in a  word, ... with my little garden and a horse to carry me about, perhaps I could convalesce\", he wrote to Mier.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=30}} But in March, Monroe reported to the House that the Spanish American governments had \"a claim to recognition by other powers which ought not to be resisted.\" The formerly reluctant Adams dismissed a protest by Spanish minister Joaqu\u00edn de Anduaga by calling the recognition \"the mere acknowledgment of existing facts\". By May{{nbsp}}4, the House and Senate had sent Monroe resolutions in support of recognition and an appropriation to put this into effect; this news was greatly celebrated in Colombia.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=27\u201329}} Pedro Jos\u00e9 Gual, now the Colombian secretary of state and foreign relations, wrote to Bol\u00edvar that Torres deserved sole credit for the achievement.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=29}}\n\nThe question remained when to send ministers and whom to recognize first. At this time, Torres was the only authorized agent in the United States for any of the Patriot governments.{{sfnp|Robertson|1915|p=189}} It was Adams' suggestion that Torres should be received as ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' immediately, with the United States reciprocating after other diplomats arrived; Monroe agreed to thus formalize his existing relationship with Torres. The ''charg\u00e9'' was invited on May{{nbsp}}23 but delayed by his poor health. Nevertheless, he insisted on traveling to Washington.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nAt 1{{nbsp}}p.m. on June{{nbsp}}19, Torres was received at the [[White House]] by Adams and Monroe. The weakened Torres told them of the importance of recognition to Colombia, and wept when the President said how satisfied he was for Torres to be received as its first representative. Indeed, he was the first representative from any Spanish American government. On leaving the short meeting, Torres gave Adams a print of the Colombian constitution.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=31}}\n\nBefore Torres departed Washington, Adams visited him on June{{nbsp}}21; he promised Adams to work for equal tariffs on American and European goods in Colombia, and predicted {{ill|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Salazar|es}} would be sent to the U.S. as permanent diplomat. Adams published a satisfied announcement in the ''[[National Intelligencer]]''.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n==Death==\nIn rapidly declining health, Torres returned to [[Hamilton Village, Philadelphia|Hamiltonville]], now in [[West Philadelphia]], where that spring he had purchased a new home. Duane was with him when he died there at 2{{nbsp}}p.m. on July{{nbsp}}15, 1822, at age{{nbsp}}59.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=32}}\n\nOn July{{nbsp}}17, the funeral procession began from Meade's house, which was joined by Commodore Daniels of the Colombian navy and prominent citizens. The procession went to St.{{nbsp}}Mary's, where the requiem mass was held by Father Hogan and Torres was buried with [[military honors]]. Ships in the harbor held their flags at half-mast. {{sfnmp|1a1=Bowman|1y=1968|1p=245|2a1=Bowman|2y=1970|2p=53}} This highly unusual display of honor was not only because Torres was well-liked, but also because he was the first foreign diplomat to die in the United States.{{sfnp|Bowman|1969|p=38}} An obituary named him \"the [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] of South America\".<ref>''New York Evening Post'', [https://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/objects/8158 \"The Franklin of South America\"], 1822, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Simon Gratz collection.

Bowman Jr. wrote a master's thesis and a series of articles about Torres in the 1960s and 1970s. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of U.S.\u2013Latin American relations in 1972, the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States]] held a session in Philadelphia because it was the home of Manuel Torres.{{sfnp|Jova|1983|p=49}}\n\nHowever, Emily Garc\u00eda documented that in 2016 Torres was obscure even to the archivists of St.&nbsp;Mary's, where the plaque still hangs.

When Gloria goes to the bathroom, armed gunmen break in through the vents and attempt to kidnap Gloria out of her stall but ultimately give her time to escape while they attack the club. Chaos ensues as Gloria is separated from Suzu. The next morning, Gloria is unable to get in contact with Suzu and decides to ride with a police officer to try to find Suzu. She informs the police officer that she has information on the men who attacked the club, and the officer asks her to follow him to the station. When the officer takes a break in a remote location, Gloria is taken by members of the Los Estrellas gang, the same men who shot up the club.\n\nThe gang take her to their headquarters, where Lino, the gang leader, agrees to help her find Suzu if she agrees to work for them. Gloria is reluctant but eventually agrees as she does not have much choice, and is told to get into a car and park it on a corner of a building. Gloria does the job, and when she leaves the car and joins the men at the top of a hill overlooking the building, they blow up the building, revealed to be a DEA safehouse containing three agents.\n\nLino then sends Gloria to the Miss Baja pageant, where she attempts an escape through the bathroom. Gloria escapes and encounters a DEA agent, Brian Reich, who takes her into custody and eventually lets her go but not before he puts a tracking device on her since the DEA are aiming to monitor Los Estrellas.\n\nGloria returns to Suzu's apartment and finds Lino there, and is sent to San Diego with blood money and drugs attached to her car. Upon crossing the border Gloria is given an arsenal of guns to bring back to Mexico by a gangster named Jimmy, and then told to meet in a large parking lot. Gloria then informs Brian about the meet-up at the parking lot, where he promises to send a SWAT team to rescue her during the mission to capture Lino and the Los Estrellas gang. As Gloria arrives at the parking lot, the men in Los Estrellas get their weapons. However the police show up under Brian's command, causing a gunfight to ensue in the lot. Gloria escapes to a nearby gate where Brian promised to send the SWAT team to pick her up, but sees nobody there. Gloria realizes that Brian had no intention to help her, only to capture Los Estrellas. Seeing Gloria stranded in the middle of the gunfight, Lino runs to Gloria to save her, but is shot in the leg. After a moment of hesitation, Gloria decides to help Lino and together, they escape with the other members of Los Estrellas.\n\nThe gang head to another safe house, where Gloria meets a woman named Isabella. Isabella herself was threatened into joining Los Estrellas, and bears an infigurative tattoo, meaning she belongs to them. When Gloria hears that they will be checking phones to find a mole in the group, she transfers the chip that Brian gave her to another phone. Lino brings Gloria on a ride to meet some family, and they spend time together as Lino shares his dream of living a simple life in the countryside despite his involvement in a gang. As they return to the safe house, the gang informs Lino that they have found the mole. Unknowingly and to her dismay, Gloria had put the chip in the phone belonging to Isabella, who is killed by Lino for being the suspected mole. Gloria is extremely upset, and the next morning she lashes out at Lino.\n\nLino explains his plan to kill The Mexican Chief of Police, Saucedo, to Gloria, and shows her a video of Suzu being auctioned off to various buyers. He explains that Suzu was taken the night of the club shooting, and is sold as an escort every night. His plan is to send Gloria to the Miss Baja pageant and ensure her victory by bribing the judges, afterwhich she will be invited to the afterparty organized by Saucedo. Gloria participates in the pageant and wins, and is then invited to the afterparty at Saucedo's beach home. At the party, she agrees to meet with Saucedo in one of the villas, which she informs Lino of the whereabouts via an in-ear microphone. Before meeting Saucedo, Gloria sees Suzu, and they reunite, Gloria telling Suzu that everything will be okay. However, when Suzu shows her a tattoo on her hand, the same tattoo that Isabella had, Gloria quickly realizes that Lino deceived her and that he had known where Suzu was the whole time.\n\nAs Gloria follows Saucedo into the villa, she writes on a postcard that Lino is going to kill him. Saucedo quickly escapes outside just as Los Estrellas begin their attack, and Gloria goes to find Suzu armed with a gun from one of the fallen Los Estrellas gang members. As Gloria goes to find Suzu, she is forced to shoot Saucedo in the leg after he tries to hold Suzu hostage, but then Lino kills him and thanks Gloria for her help in killing Saucedo. Gloria points her gun at Lino, confessing she knows that he was aware of Suzu's whereabouts. Lino tries to bargain with Gloria telling her that they both did what needed to be done, but she ends up shooting and killing him.\n\nThe two women are soon arrested when the cops arrive at the party, and when Gloria is taken into an interrogation room, she finds Jimmy, the man she had received the weapons from in San Diego, and realizes that he is a CIA agent. Gloria has Jimmy free Suzu and herself, and she returns Suzu to her family and goes back into the car with Jimmy, driving off to join the CIA.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Gina Rodriguez]] as Gloria Fuentes, a [[makeup artist]] from [[Los Angeles]].\n* [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]] as Lino Esparza, the chief of Las Estrellas, a gang from [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]].\n* [[Matt Lauria]] as Brian Reich, a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] officer.\n* [[Ricardo Abarca]] as Pollo, Lino's main henchman.\n* Cristina Rodlo as Suzu Ram\u00f3s, Gloria's best friend who lives in [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]] and a competitor on the Miss Baja California pageant.\n* Sebasti\u00e1n Cano as Chava Ram\u00f3s, Suzu's little brother who lives with her.\n* [[Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar]] as Rafael Saucedo, [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]] chief of police.\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Jimmy, a gangster from [[San Diego]], who is secretly a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.\n* [[Aislinn Derbez]] as Isabel, a woman abducted by Las Estrellas.\n* Lilian Guadalupe Tapia Robles as Do\u00f1a Rosita, a woman who work for Las Estrellas.\n* Erick Rene Delgadillo Urbina as Tuc\u00e1n, Lino's henchman.\n* Mikhail Plata as Chivo, Lino's henchman.\n* Jorge Humberto Millan Mardue\u00f1o as Ortiz, Lino's henchman.\n* [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] as Justin, Gloria's boss in [[Los Angeles]].\n* Jos\u00e9 Sefami as Don Ramon, a man who work for Rafael Saucedo.\n* Gaby Orihuela as the coordinator of the Miss Baja California pageant.\n* Roberto Sosa as the police officer who secretly work for Las Estrellas.\n\n==Production==\nIn April 2017, it was announced [[Catherine Hardwicke]] would direct the film, from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, with [[Kevin Misher]] and Pablo Cruz producing the film, with [[Andy Berman]] serving as an executive producer on the film.

When Gloria goes to the bathroom, armed gunmen break in through the vents and attempt to kidnap Gloria out of her stall but ultimately give her time to escape while they attack the club. Chaos ensues as Gloria is separated from Suzu. The next morning, Gloria is unable to get in contact with Suzu and decides to ride with a police officer to try to find Suzu. She informs the police officer that she has information on the men who attacked the club, and the officer asks her to follow him to the station. When the officer takes a break in a remote location, Gloria is taken by members of the Los Estrellas gang, the same men who shot up the club.\n\nThe gang take her to their headquarters, where Lino, the gang leader, agrees to help her find Suzu if she agrees to work for them. Gloria is reluctant but eventually agrees as she does not have much choice, and is told to get into a car and park it on a corner of a building. Gloria does the job, and when she leaves the car and joins the men at the top of a hill overlooking the building, they blow up the building, revealed to be a DEA safehouse containing three agents.\n\nLino then sends Gloria to the Miss Baja pageant, where she attempts an escape through the bathroom. Gloria escapes and encounters a DEA agent, Brian Reich, who takes her into custody and eventually lets her go but not before he puts a tracking device on her since the DEA are aiming to monitor Los Estrellas.\n\nGloria returns to Suzu's apartment and finds Lino there, and is sent to San Diego with blood money and drugs attached to her car. Upon crossing the border Gloria is given an arsenal of guns to bring back to Mexico by a gangster named Jimmy, and then told to meet in a large parking lot. Gloria then informs Brian about the meet-up at the parking lot, where he promises to send a SWAT team to rescue her during the mission to capture Lino and the Los Estrellas gang. As Gloria arrives at the parking lot, the men in Los Estrellas get their weapons. However the police show up under Brian's command, causing a gunfight to ensue in the lot. Gloria escapes to a nearby gate where Brian promised to send the SWAT team to pick her up, but sees nobody there. Gloria realizes that Brian had no intention to help her, only to capture Los Estrellas. Seeing Gloria stranded in the middle of the gunfight, Lino runs to Gloria to save her, but is shot in the leg. After a moment of hesitation, Gloria decides to help Lino and together, they escape with the other members of Los Estrellas.\n\nThe gang head to another safe house, where Gloria meets a woman named Isabella. Isabella herself was threatened into joining Los Estrellas, and bears an infigurative tattoo, meaning she belongs to them. When Gloria hears that they will be checking phones to find a mole in the group, she transfers the chip that Brian gave her to another phone. Lino brings Gloria on a ride to meet some family, and they spend time together as Lino shares his dream of living a simple life in the countryside despite his involvement in a gang. As they return to the safe house, the gang informs Lino that they have found the mole. Unknowingly and to her dismay, Gloria had put the chip in the phone belonging to Isabella, who is killed by Lino for being the suspected mole. Gloria is extremely upset, and the next morning she lashes out at Lino.\n\nLino explains his plan to kill The Mexican Chief of Police, Saucedo, to Gloria, and shows her a video of Suzu being auctioned off to various buyers. He explains that Suzu was taken the night of the club shooting, and is sold as an escort every night. His plan is to send Gloria to the Miss Baja pageant and ensure her victory by bribing the judges, afterwhich she will be invited to the afterparty organized by Saucedo. Gloria participates in the pageant and wins, and is then invited to the afterparty at Saucedo's beach home. At the party, she agrees to meet with Saucedo in one of the villas, which she informs Lino of the whereabouts via an in-ear microphone. Before meeting Saucedo, Gloria sees Suzu, and they reunite, Gloria telling Suzu that everything will be okay. However, when Suzu shows her a tattoo on her hand, the same tattoo that Isabella had, Gloria quickly realizes that Lino deceived her and that he had known where Suzu was the whole time.\n\nAs Gloria follows Saucedo into the villa, she writes on a postcard that Lino is going to kill him. Saucedo quickly escapes outside just as Los Estrellas begin their attack, and Gloria goes to find Suzu armed with a gun from one of the fallen Los Estrellas gang members. As Gloria goes to find Suzu, she is forced to shoot Saucedo in the leg after he tries to hold Suzu hostage, but then Lino kills him and thanks Gloria for her help in killing Saucedo. Gloria points her gun at Lino, confessing she knows that he was aware of Suzu's whereabouts. Lino tries to bargain with Gloria telling her that they both did what needed to be done, but she ends up shooting and killing him.\n\nThe two women are soon arrested when the cops arrive at the party, and when Gloria is taken into an interrogation room, she finds Jimmy, the man she had received the weapons from in San Diego, and realizes that he is a CIA agent. Gloria has Jimmy free Suzu and herself, and she returns Suzu to her family and goes back into the car with Jimmy, driving off to join the CIA.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Gina Rodriguez]] as Gloria Fuentes, a [[makeup artist]] from [[Los Angeles]].\n* [[Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova]] as Lino Esparza, the chief of Las Estrellas, a gang from [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]].\n* [[Matt Lauria]] as Brian Reich, a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] officer.\n* [[Ricardo Abarca]] as Pollo, Lino's main henchman.\n* Cristina Rodlo as Suzu Ram\u00f3s, Gloria's best friend who lives in [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]] and a competitor on the Miss Baja California pageant.\n* Sebasti\u00e1n Cano as Chava Ram\u00f3s, Suzu's little brother who lives with her.\n* [[Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar]] as Rafael Saucedo, [[Tijuana, Mexico|Tijuana]] chief of police.\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Jimmy, a gangster from [[San Diego]], who is secretly a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.\n* [[Aislinn Derbez]] as Isabel, a woman abducted by Las Estrellas.\n* Lilian Guadalupe Tapia Robles as Do\u00f1a Rosita, a woman who work for Las Estrellas.\n* Erick Rene Delgadillo Urbina as Tuc\u00e1n, Lino's henchman.\n* Mikhail Plata as Chivo, Lino's henchman.\n* Jorge Humberto Millan Mardue\u00f1o as Ortiz, Lino's henchman.\n* [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] as Justin, Gloria's boss in [[Los Angeles]].\n* Jos\u00e9 Sefami as Don Ramon, a man who work for Rafael Saucedo.\n* Gaby Orihuela as the coordinator of the Miss Baja California pageant.\n* Roberto Sosa as the police officer who secretly work for Las Estrellas.\n\n==Production==\nIn April 2017, it was announced [[Catherine Hardwicke]] would direct the film, from a screenplay by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, with [[Kevin Misher]] and Pablo Cruz producing the film, with [[Andy Berman]] serving as an executive producer on the film.
