{"title_page": "An Unbelievable Story of Rape", "text_new": "\"'''An Unbelievable Story of Rape'''\" is a 2015 article about a [[Washington and Colorado serial rape cases|series of rapes]] in the U.S. states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]] that occurred between 2008 and 2011, and the subsequent police investigations. It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.
