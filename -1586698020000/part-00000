It follows the lives of a group of children living on [[Degrassi Street]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The series grew out of four [[short films]]: ''[[Ida Makes a Movie]]'', ''Cookie Goes to the Hospital'', ''Irene Moves In'' and ''Noel Buys a Suit'', which originally aired as after-school specials on [[CBC Television]] in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982, respectively. The show was acclaimed for its realistic depiction of everyday children's lives and tribulations, and it remains memorable to many Canadians because of this.\n\n''The Kids of Degrassi Street'' featured many of the same actors who would later appear on ''[[Degrassi Junior High]]'' and ''[[Degrassi High]]'', including [[Stacie Mistysyn]], [[Neil Hope]], [[Anais Granofsky]], [[Sarah Charlesworth (actress)|Sarah Charlesworth]] and others. However, their character names and families were different, so this series cannot technically be seen as an immediate precursor to the later shows.<ref>{{cite news|title= Popsmacked!: The sad, sweet legacy of Degrassi\u2019s \u2018Wheels\u2019  |work= [[The Record (Kitchener, Ontario)|The Record]]|date=|url= http://www.therecord.com/whatson/artsentertainment/article/684889--the-sad-sweet-legacy-of-degrassi-s-wheels|accessdate=2012-03-11}}</ref>\n\nThe show has also aired on [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom, on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] and [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]] in Australia, on [[TVB]] in Hong Kong, on [[RT\u00c9 One]] and [[RT\u00c9 Two]] in Ireland, on [[M-Net]] in South Africa, on [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation|ZNBC]] in Zambia, [[KTV2]] in Kuwait, on [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] in Namibia, on [[TV1 (Malaysia)|RTM 1]] in Malaysia, on ZTV in Zimbabwe, on [[GBC TV]] in Gibraltar, on [[StarPlus]] in India and also started airing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on March 3, 1982 as well as subsequently on the [[Disney Channel]] in the United States.\n\n==Episode list==\n<!-- Do not edit the table unless you absolutely know how.\n     Use the preview button before saving, or request changes on the talk page\n  -->\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:white;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom:3px solid #EC9045;\"\n! # !!

It follows the lives of a group of children living on [[Degrassi Street]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The series grew out of four [[short films]]: ''[[Ida Makes a Movie]]'', ''Cookie Goes to the Hospital'', ''Irene Moves In'' and ''Noel Buys a Suit'', which originally aired as after-school specials on [[CBC Television]] in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982, respectively. The show was acclaimed for its realistic depiction of everyday children's lives and tribulations, and it remains memorable to many Canadians because of this.\n\n''The Kids of Degrassi Street'' featured many of the same actors who would later appear on ''[[Degrassi Junior High]]'' and ''[[Degrassi High]]'', including [[Stacie Mistysyn]], [[Neil Hope]], [[Anais Granofsky]], [[Sarah Charlesworth (actress)|Sarah Charlesworth]] and others. However, their character names and families were different, so this series cannot technically be seen as an immediate precursor to the later shows.<ref>{{cite news|title= Popsmacked!: The sad, sweet legacy of Degrassi\u2019s \u2018Wheels\u2019  |work= [[The Record (Kitchener, Ontario)|The Record]]|date=|url= http://www.therecord.com/whatson/artsentertainment/article/684889--the-sad-sweet-legacy-of-degrassi-s-wheels|accessdate=2012-03-11}}</ref>\n\nThe show has also aired on [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom, on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]], [[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC Kids]] and [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]] in Australia, on [[TVB]] in Hong Kong, on [[RT\u00c9 One]] and [[RT\u00c9 Two]] in Ireland, on [[M-Net]] in South Africa, on [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation|ZNBC]] in Zambia, [[KTV2]] in Kuwait, on [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] in Namibia, on [[TV1 (Malaysia)|RTM 1]] in Malaysia, on ZTV in Zimbabwe, on [[GBC TV]] in Gibraltar, on [[StarPlus]] in India and also started airing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on March 3, 1982 as well as subsequently on the [[Disney Channel]] in the United States.\n\n==Episode list==\n<!-- Do not edit the table unless you absolutely know how.\n     Use the preview button before saving, or request changes on the talk page\n  -->\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:white;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom:3px solid #EC9045;\"\n! # !!

There are sixteen ten minute episodes, and the characters were created and the stories written by writer Richard Everett. The series was aired by [[Channel 4]] in 1994. It aired on children's channels like [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIt was about two bumbling [[construction worker]]s (Dig and Dug), who were given a task to accomplish over a five minute short. Aside from using segments much like [[Laurel and Hardy]] shorts, the show also taught children about [[construction]]. The show was narrated by [[George Layton]]. The animated series was created, produced and directed by Terry Ward M D at Flicks Films Ltd, Wardour Street, London.\n\n== Major characters ==\n* '''Dig''': Dig is Dug's fellow companion, young, tall and skinny in appearance. Despite being eager, hard working, and ready for the job, he is quite na\u00efve, can be easily frightened, and is inexperienced. This can often lead to comical predicaments! However, little by little, Dig is starting to learn a little bit more about machinery and construction. He is presumably in his early 30s.\n* '''Dug''': Dug is Dig's fellow co worker. He is stumpy, a little bit older than Dig, a bit more experienced with machinery, but just as bumbling and na\u00efve. Dug often controls (or tries to control) the assignments given to him and Dig, but his clumsiness often gets the two of them into trouble. He can even make little, fixable problems become huge and serious. He is most likely just about in his 40s.\n* '''Daisy''': Daisy is Dug's long suffering niece. She is smarter than the two construction workers put together, so this allows her and her Aunt Beth to solve almost any problem that Dig and Dug cannot solve at all. Neither her mother nor father have ever appeared on the show for unknown reasons, but it is safe to assume that her Uncle Dug would be the brother of either one of Daisy's parents.\n* '''Farmer Stubble''': Farmer Stubble lives at Merryweather Farm. He appeared as a main character in the first four episodes, 'The New Tractor', 'Turnips in the Lane', 'Fencing the Field' and 'Trouble at the Haybarn.' His first name is revealed to be Ernest and his wife's name is Mildred. Mrs. Stubble also appeared in 'The New Tractor' and 'Trouble at the Haybarn', but in 'Turnips in the Lane' and 'Fencing the Field', Farmer Stubble appeared without her. As his name suggests, he has a [[Shaving|stubble]] on his chin.\nHowever, the two of them appeared in 'Night Patrol' and Ernest also appeared in 'The New Office'. They even appeared in flashbacks from the first two episodes seen in 'The 100th Tractor' when Dug was telling the Mayoress about several adventures that he and Dig had been on earlier while taking her to the tractor factory.\n* '''Mr. Rubble''': Dig and Dug's building site boss. It is unknown what accent he talks in, although his voice does have a loud booming tone. The only four episodes he appeared in were 'Mrs. Sparkle's Shed', 'Cement Pudding', 'Mr. Rubble's Wall' and 'Daisy's Kite'. Not to be confused with Barney Rubble from ''[[The Flintstones]]''.\n* '''Mr. MacAdam''': Mr. MacAdam is Dig and Dug's boss of the Roadworks site. He is very good with machinery and construction, but a closer look reveals that Mr. MacAdam is almost just as clumsy and bumbling as Dig and Dug himself. He talks in a [[Scots language|Scottish]] accent. The only four episodes he appeared in were 'Night Patrol', 'Nowhere to Park', 'The Giant Molehill' and 'Race to the Finish'.\n* '''Mr. Packet''': Mr. Packet is Dig and Dug's manager of the tractor factory and talks in a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] accent. he can discover voices inside the factory. he can deal with things such as Oswald behaving badly, his new office arriving late making him feel upset and worried, and solve Oswald's problem by 'saying he has run out of paint' on the day of 'The 100th Tractor'. The only four episodes he appeared in were 'All Hooked Up', 'Oswald Misbehaves', 'The New Office' and 'The 100th Tractor'.\n\n==International broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom\n**[[Channel 4]]\n**[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] (''[[Milkshake!]]'')\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n**[[Nickelodeon (Australia and New Zealand)|Nickelodeon]]\n* {{flagicon|Namibia}} Namibla\n**[[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Republic of Ireland\n**[[Network 2]] (''[[The Den (Ireland)|The Den]]'')\n* {{flagicon|SA}} South Africa\n**[[SABC2]] (''Tube'')\n* {{flagicon|Zimbabwe}} Zimbabwe\n**[[SABC2]] (''Tube'')\n* {{flagicon|Arab League}} Arab World\n** [[Spacetoon]]\n\n==References==\n* http://www.richardeverett.co.uk \u2013 The official website of writer Richard Everett\n[[Category:1994 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1994 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:Channel 4 television programmes]]\n[[Category:1990s British animated television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Fictional trios]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Dig & Dug with Daisy\n| image                = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| genre                = Animation\n| creator              = Terry Ward\n| writer               = Richard Everett\n| director             = Terry Ward\n| creative_director    = \n| voices               = [[George Layton]]\n| narrated             = [[George Layton]]| opentheme            = \n| endtheme             = \n| composer             = [[Mark London]]<br>Francis Haines\n| country              = United Kingdom\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 1\n| num_episodes         = 16\n| list_episodes        = \n| executive_producer   = Simon Jollands\n| producer             = Terry Ward\n| editor               = \n| camera               = \n| runtime              = 10 minutes\n| company              = [[Dorling Kindersley]]\n| distributor          = \n| network              = [[Channel 4]]\n| picture_format       = 4:3\n| audio_format         = [[Monaural]]\n| first_aired          = \n| last_aired           = \n| website              = \n| production_website   = \n}}\n'''''Dig & Dug with Daisy''''' is a [[stop motion]] [[animated television series]] that was produced in the United Kingdom during 1993 by [[Dorling Kindersley]] (publishers of the ''Eyewitness Books'' Series). There are sixteen ten minute episodes, and the characters were created and the stories written by writer Richard Everett. The series was aired by [[Channel 4]] in 1994. It aired on children's channels like [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIt was about two bumbling [[construction worker]]s (Dig and Dug), who were given a task to accomplish over a five minute short. Aside from using segments much like [[Laurel and Hardy]] shorts, the show also taught children about [[construction]]. The show was narrated by [[George Layton]]. The animated series was created, produced and directed by Terry Ward M D at Flicks Films Ltd, Wardour Street, London.\n\n== Major characters ==\n* '''Dig''': Dig is Dug's fellow companion, young, tall and skinny in appearance. Despite being eager, hard working, and ready for the job, he is quite na\u00efve, can be easily frightened, and is inexperienced. This can often lead to comical predicaments! However, little by little, Dig is starting to learn a little bit more about machinery and construction. He is presumably in his early 30s.\n* '''Dug''': Dug is Dig's fellow co worker. He is stumpy, a little bit older than Dig, a bit more experienced with machinery, but just as bumbling and na\u00efve. Dug often controls (or tries to control) the assignments given to him and Dig, but his clumsiness often gets the two of them into trouble. He can even make little, fixable problems become huge and serious. He is most likely just about in his 40s.\n* '''Daisy''': Daisy is Dug's long suffering niece. She is smarter than the two construction workers put together, so this allows her and her Aunt Beth to solve almost any problem that Dig and Dug cannot solve at all.

It is located on a hill overlooking the port of [[Dartmouth, Devon]], [[England]]. Royal Naval officer training has taken place in Dartmouth since 1863. The buildings of the current campus were completed in 1905. Earlier students lived in two wooden [[hulk (ship type)|hulk]]s moored in the [[River Dart]]. Since 1998, BRNC has been the sole centre for Royal Naval officer training.\n\n==History==\nThe training of naval officers at Dartmouth dates from 1863, when the wooden hulk {{HMS|Britannia|1820|6}} was moved from [[Portland Harbour|Portland]] and moored in the [[River Dart]] to serve as a base.<ref name=\"YG39\">{{harvnb|Walker|1938|p=39}}</ref> In 1864, after an influx of new recruits, ''Britannia'' was supplemented by {{HMS|Hindostan|1841|6}}.<ref name=\"YG40\">{{harvnb|Walker|1938|p=40}}</ref>  Prior to this, a [[Royal Naval Academy]] (later Royal Naval College) had operated for more than a century from 1733 to 1837 at [[Portsmouth]], a major naval installation.

Officer cadets, as they are known until passing out from the college, can join between the ages of 18 and 32.
