When Finn believes that he has become psychic, he winds up convincing Ava of his abilities, before revealing that he has pranked her.\n\n''Guest stars'': Michael McCusker as Boomer, Kristina Hayes as Ma Gower, Scarlett Abinante as Skyler\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 81\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 23\n| Title           = Whisper Toots\n| DirectedBy      = Jody Margolin Hahn\n| WrittenBy       = Jason Dorris\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|6}}\n| ProdCode        = 423\n| Viewers         = 0.54<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-6-2020.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.6.2020|work=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|author=[[Mitch Metcalf]]|date=March 9, 2020|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Lou wants to have friends her own age, and she is happy when she befriends a group of women who hold meetings in the woods. Ava finds the women odd and suspects they are witches, but Lou does not believe her. Later, Lou decides to part ways with the group after learning that Ava was right. Meanwhile, Noah and Destiny learn that Matteo has been sneaking out at night to perform a piano act for older people at Miss Tilly's inn. To avoid hurting his feelings, Noah and Destiny lie to Matteo by saying that they enjoyed his act. Matteo had avoided performing at the camp because he believed that the children would not enjoy his act, but he gains confidence after learning that Noah and Destiny liked it. They confess to him after he decides to perform for the camp, but the three later come together for a joint act. The campers are not impressed, but Matteo is happy that he can still perform at the inn. Elsewhere, Finn tries to help Gwen break a world record so she can get into a book of records, although he accidentally ruins each of their efforts. Later, he gives Gwen a handmade book of his own about their attempts to break a record, and Gwen is happy to receive it.\n\n''Guest stars'': Ellen Karsten as Miss Tilly, Chandler Ryan as Martha\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 82\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 24\n| Title           = My Fairy Lady\n| DirectedBy      = Bob Koherr\n| WrittenBy       = Leah Folta & Lia Woodward\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|13}}\n| ProdCode        = 424\n| Viewers         = 0.44<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-13-2020.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.13.2020|work=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|author=[[Mitch Metcalf]]|date=March 16, 2020|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Finn is upset when his mother's boyfriend Dave visits the camp.

When Lou tries to solve the problem, Finn reveals that he actually does like Dave but that he felt guilty, as he does not want his father to feel like he is being replaced. Lou helps Finn realize that he can like both his father and Dave. Meanwhile, Ava learns she was not invited to a party for the camp counselors because she is considered unfriendly.

However, Lou has only a day to write her speech, and Destiny turns out to be a distraction. Later, Destiny becomes trapped behind a [[Murphy bed|folding bed]] in their hotel room, and Lou winds up missing the conference while trying to get her out. Destiny reveals that she wanted to come on the trip because she misses hanging out with Lou, like when they lived together in Woodchuck Cabin. Lou misses Destiny too and decides to set aside a day each week for them to spend time together. At the camp, Noah is left in charge during Lou's absence. Ava's birthday is coming up, but she tells Noah that she does not want to celebrate, while hinting that she actually does want a party. Ava is upset when she thinks a party is not being planned, and she is surprised when she finds out she was wrong. Meanwhile, while [[stargazing]], Gwen suddenly abandons Matteo without explanation. Matteo realizes that he had chocolate on the back of his pants, and he fears that Gwen believes he pooped his pants.

In a back-to-back victory,the country won the contest with the song \"[[Tu te reconna\u00eetras]]\", this being Luxembourg's fourth win. The voting was a very close one, with Spain finishing only 4 points behind and [[Cliff Richard]] of the United Kingdom (who had come second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968]]) another 2 points further back. The winning song scored the highest score ever achieved in Eurovision under any voting format until 1975, recording 129 points out of a possible 160, which represented almost 81% of the possible maximum. This was partly due to a scoring system which guaranteed all countries at least two points from each other country.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy.

It is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Alzette]] and [[P\u00e9trusse]] Rivers in southern Luxembourg. The city contains the historic '''Luxembourg Castle''', established by the [[Franks]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]], around which a settlement developed.\n\nThe Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg, inaugurated in 1964 as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal de la Ville de Luxembourg, became the venue for the 1973 contest. It is the city's major venue for drama, opera and ballet.<ref>[http://salesguide.lu/press-en-4-321.html \"The \"Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\" of Luxembourg City offers high quality cultural events\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722160736/http://salesguide.lu/press-en-4-321.html |date=2011-07-22 }}, ''Luxembourg National Tourist Office, London''.

The event was marked by controversy when the [[Spain|Spanish]] song, \"Eres t\u00fa\" (by Mocedades), was accused of [[plagiarism]] due to reasonable similarities in the melody with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] entry from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] (\"[[Brez besed]]\" sung by [[Berta Ambro\u017e]]); however, \"Eres t\u00fa\" was not disqualified. After finishing second in the contest, the song went on to become a huge international hit.\n\nThe somewhat elliptical lyrics to Portugal's entry \"[[Tourada]]\" provided sufficient cover for a song that was clearly understood as a blistering assault on the country's decaying dictatorship. Also, the word \"breasts\" was used during Sweden's song entry. However, no action was taken by the EBU.  An argument broke out between the singer [[Maxi (singer)|Maxi]] and her [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] delegation over how the song should be performed. During rehearsals she repeatedly stopped performing in frustration. When it began to appear possible that Maxi might withdraw from the contest, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] immediately sent over another singer, [[Tina Reynolds]], to take her place just in case. In the end Miss Reynolds wasn't needed as Maxi did perform, with her entry earning 10th place on the scoreboard. (Reynolds would perform [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|the following year]].)\n\nThis contest holds the record for the most watched Eurovision Song Contest in the [[United Kingdom]], and is also the 18th [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#Most watched programmes|most watched television show]] in the same country, with an estimated 21.54 million tuning in on the night. [[Cliff Richard]] represented the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with the song [[Power to All Our Friends]]. He came 3rd with 123 points. The winner though was [[Anne-Marie David]] with '[[Tu te reconna\u00eetras]]'. In the UK it was released in English under the title \"Wonderful Dream\" and released on Epic. It made number 13.\n\nIn the light of events at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, there were fears of a terrorist threat, particularly directed against Israel's first-ever entrant, leading to unusually tight security for the contest.  This gave rise to one of the best-known Eurovision anecdotes, frequently recounted by the UK's long-serving commentator [[Terry Wogan]].  He recalled that the floor manager strongly advised the audience to remain seated while applauding the performances, otherwise they risked being shot by security forces.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History.

They each awarded 1 to 5 points for each song (other than the song from their own country) immediately after it was performed and the votes were collected and counted as soon as they were cast. The juries watched the show on TV from the Ville du Louvigny TV Studios of CLT and appeared on screen to confirm their scores.\n\n== Participating countries ==\nSeventeen nations took part in this year's contest.  [[Malta]] was drawn to perform in 6th place between [[Norway]] and [[Monaco]], but the Maltese broadcaster withdrew before the deadline to select an entry.<ref name=\"eurovisionsongs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|title=No, No, Never!!! - Songs That Did Not Make It To Eurovision|website=eurovisionsongs.net|accessdate=2009-07-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301032000/http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|archivedate=2009-03-01}}</ref>  \nThis was the first year [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]] competed in the contest.\nThe 1973 contest marked the first time that women conducted the ESC orchestra.

In a back-to-back victory,the country won the contest with the song \"[[Tu te reconna\u00eetras]]\", this being Luxembourg's fourth win. The voting was a very close one, with Spain finishing only 4 points behind and [[Cliff Richard]] of the United Kingdom (who had come second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968]]) another 2 points further back. The winning song scored the highest score ever achieved in Eurovision under any voting format until 1975, recording 129 points out of a possible 160, which represented almost 81% of the possible maximum. This was partly due to a scoring system which guaranteed all countries at least two points from each other country.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy.

It is located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Alzette]] and [[P\u00e9trusse]] Rivers in southern Luxembourg. The city contains the historic '''Luxembourg Castle''', established by the [[Franks]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]], around which a settlement developed.\n\nThe Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Luxembourg, inaugurated in 1964 as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal de la Ville de Luxembourg, became the venue for the 1973 contest. It is the city's major venue for drama, opera and ballet.<ref>[http://salesguide.lu/press-en-4-321.html \"The \"Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\" of Luxembourg City offers high quality cultural events\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722160736/http://salesguide.lu/press-en-4-321.html |date=2011-07-22 }}, ''Luxembourg National Tourist Office, London''.

The event was marked by controversy when the [[Spain|Spanish]] song, \"Eres t\u00fa\" (by Mocedades), was accused of [[plagiarism]] due to reasonable similarities in the melody with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] entry from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] (\"[[Brez besed]]\" sung by [[Berta Ambro\u017e]]); however, \"Eres t\u00fa\" was not disqualified. After finishing second in the contest, the song went on to become a huge international hit.\n\nThe somewhat elliptical lyrics to Portugal's entry \"[[Tourada]]\" provided sufficient cover for a song that was clearly understood as a blistering assault on the country's decaying dictatorship. Also, the word \"breasts\" was used during Sweden's song entry. However, no action was taken by the EBU.  An argument broke out between the singer [[Maxi (singer)|Maxi]] and her [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] delegation over how the song should be performed. During rehearsals she repeatedly stopped performing in frustration. When it began to appear possible that Maxi might withdraw from the contest, [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] immediately sent over another singer, [[Tina Reynolds]], to take her place just in case. In the end Miss Reynolds wasn't needed as Maxi did perform, with her entry earning 10th place on the scoreboard. (Reynolds would perform [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|the following year]].)\n\nThis contest holds the record for the most watched Eurovision Song Contest in the [[United Kingdom]], and is also the 18th [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#Most watched programmes|most watched television show]] in the same country, with an estimated 21.54 million tuning in on the night. [[Cliff Richard]] represented the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with the song [[Power to All Our Friends]]. He came 3rd with 123 points. The winner though was [[Anne-Marie David]] with '[[Tu te reconna\u00eetras]]'. In the UK it was released in English under the title \"Wonderful Dream\" and released on Epic. It made number 13.\n\nIn the light of events at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, there were fears of a terrorist threat, particularly directed against Israel's first-ever entrant, leading to unusually tight security for the contest.  This gave rise to one of the best-known Eurovision anecdotes, frequently recounted by the UK's long-serving commentator [[Terry Wogan]].  He recalled that the floor manager strongly advised the audience to remain seated while applauding the performances, otherwise they risked being shot by security forces.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy.

They each awarded 1 to 5 points for each song (other than the song from their own country) immediately after it was performed and the votes were collected and counted as soon as they were cast. The juries watched the show on TV from the Ville du Louvigny TV Studios of CLT and appeared on screen to confirm their scores.\n\n== Participating countries ==\nSeventeen nations took part in this year's contest.  [[Malta]] was drawn to perform in 6th place between [[Norway]] and [[Monaco]], but the Maltese broadcaster withdrew before the deadline to select an entry.<ref name=\"eurovisionsongs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|title=No, No, Never!!! - Songs That Did Not Make It To Eurovision|website=eurovisionsongs.net|accessdate=2009-07-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301032000/http://www.eurovisionsongs.net/nononever.htm|archivedate=2009-03-01}}</ref>  \nThis was the first year [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest|Israel]] competed in the contest.\nThe 1973 contest marked the first time that women conducted the ESC orchestra.

In 2009, Roth's 30th book, ''[[The Humbling]]'', was published. It tells the story of the last performances of Simon Axler, a celebrated stage actor. Roth's 31st book, ''[[Nemesis (Philip Roth novel)|Nemesis]]'', was published on October 5, 2010.

In October 2009, during an interview with [[Tina Brown]] of ''The Daily Beast'' to promote ''The Humbling'', Roth considered the future of literature and its place in society, stating his belief that within 25 years the reading of novels will be regarded as a \"cultic\" activity:\n\n<blockquote>I was being optimistic about 25 years really. I think it's going to be cultic. I think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people. Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range. ... To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you don't read the novel really. So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by\u2014it's hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities[.]<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title= Philip Roth predicts novel will be minority cult within 25 years |date=October 26, 2009 |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/26/philip-roth-novel-minority-cult}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen asked about the prospects for printed versus digital books, Roth was equally downbeat:\n\n<blockquote>The book can't compete with the screen.

Critic Jacques Berlinerblau noted in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' that these fictional voices create a complex and tricky experience for readers, deceiving them into believing they \"know\" Roth.<ref name = \"Berlinerblau\"/> In Roth's fiction the question of authorship is intertwined with the theme of the idealistic, secular Jewish son who attempts to distance himself from Jewish customs and traditions, and from what he perceives as the sometimes suffocating influence of parents, rabbis, and other community leaders.<ref name =\"GreenbergP11\" /> Roth's fiction has been described by critics as pervaded by \"a kind of alienation that is enlivened and exacerbated by what binds it\".<ref name=\"GreenbergP11\">Greenberg, Robert M. (Winter 1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150904132552/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n4_v43/ai_20614549/pg_11/ \"Transgression in the Fiction of Philip Roth\".] ''Twentieth Century Literature''.

In response, Roth, in his 1963 essay \"Writing About Jews\" (collected in ''Reading Myself and Others''), maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to Jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class Jewish Americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility:\n<blockquote>The cry 'Watch out for the goyim!' at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning: Oh that they were out there, so that we could be together here! A rumor of persecution, a taste of exile, might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habits\u2014something to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference, the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts, and where one cannot always figure out what a Jew is that a Christian is not.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=Philip |date=December 1963 |title=Writing About Jews |journal=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Roth's fiction the exploration of \"promiscuous instincts\" within the context of Jewish lives, mainly from a male viewpoint, plays an important role. In the words of critic [[Hermione Lee]]:\n<blockquote>Philip Roth's fiction strains to shed the burden of Jewish traditions and proscriptions. ... The liberated Jewish consciousness, let loose into the disintegration of the American Dream, finds itself deracinated and homeless. American society and politics, by the late sixties, are a grotesque travesty of what Jewish immigrants had traveled towards: liberty, peace, security, a decent liberal democracy.<ref name=\"Lee\">Lee, Hermione (1982). ''Philip Roth''. New York: Methuen & Co., 1982.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile Roth's fiction has strong autobiographical influences, it also incorporates social commentary and political satire, most obviously in ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' and ''[[Operation Shylock]]''. From the 1990s on Roth's fiction often combined autobiographical elements with retrospective dramatizations of postwar American life. Roth described ''[[American Pastoral]]'' and the two following novels as a loosely connected \"American trilogy\". Each of these novels treats aspects of the postwar era against the backdrop of the nostalgically remembered Jewish-American childhood of Nathan Zuckerman, in which the experience of life on [[United States home front during World War II|the American home front during the Second World War]] features prominently.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn much of Roth's fiction, the 1940s, comprising Roth's and Zuckerman's childhood, mark a high point of American idealism and social cohesion. A more satirical treatment of the patriotism and idealism of the war years is evident in Roth's comic novels, such as ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' and ''[[Sabbath's Theater]]''. In ''[[The Plot Against America]]'', the [[alternate history]] of the war years dramatizes the prevalence of [[anti-Semitism]] and racism in America at the time, despite the promotion of increasingly influential anti-racist ideals during the war. In his fiction Roth portrayed the 1940s, and the [[New Deal]] era of the 1930s that preceded it, as a heroic phase in American history. A sense of frustration with social and political developments in the United States since the 1940s is palpable in the American trilogy and ''[[Exit Ghost]]'', but had already been present in Roth's earlier works that contained political and social satire, such as ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' and ''[[The Great American Novel (Roth)|The Great American Novel]]''. Writing about the latter, Hermione Lee points to the sense of disillusionment with \"the American Dream\" in Roth's fiction: \"The mythic words on which Roth's generation was brought up\u2014winning, patriotism, gamesmanship\u2014are desanctified; greed, fear, racism, and political ambition are disclosed as the motive forces behind the 'all-American ideals'.\"<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nAlthough Roth's writings often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth rejected being labeled a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] writer. \"It's not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it's really not interesting,\" he told the [[The Guardian|Guardian newspaper]] in 2005. \"I'm an American.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-philiproth/pulitzer-winning-author-philip-roth-dies-at-85-says-agent-idUSKCN1IO0CM|title=Pulitzer-winning author Philip Roth dies at 85, says agent|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhile at [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], Roth met Margaret Martinson in 1956, who became his first wife in 1959. Their separation in 1963, and Martinson's subsequent death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's literary output. Martinson was the inspiration for female characters in several of Roth's novels, including Lucy Nelson in ''[[When She Was Good]]'' and Maureen Tarnopol in ''[[My Life as a Man]].''<ref>Roth, Philip. ''[[The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography]]''. New York, 1988.  Roth discusses Martinson's portrait in this memoir. He calls her \"Josie\" in ''[[When She Was Good]]'' on pp. 149 and 175. He discusses her as an inspiration for ''[[My Life as a Man]]'' throughout the book's second half, most completely in the chapter \"Girl of My Dreams,\" which includes this on p. 110: \"Why should I have tried to make up anything better? How could I?\" Her influence upon ''Portnoy's Complaint'' is seen in ''The Facts'' as more diffuse, a kind of loosening-up for the author:  \"It took time and it took blood, and not, really, until I began ''Portnoy's Complaint'' would I be able to cut loose with anything approaching her gift for flabbergasting boldness.\" (p. 149)</ref> \n\nRoth was an [[atheist]] who once said, \"When the whole world doesn't believe in God, it'll be a great place.\"<ref name=\"Ulysses Press\">{{cite book|title=The Wit and Blasphemy of Atheists: 500 Greatest Quips and Quotes from Freethinkers, Non-Believers and the Happily Damned|year=2011|publisher=Ulysses Press|isbn=978-1569759707|page=190|quote=When the whole world doesn't believe in God, it'll be a great place. \u2013 Philip Roth}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Roth on Fame, Sex and God|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philip-roth-on-fame-sex-and-god/|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=May 5, 2014|author=Rita Braver|quote='Do you consider yourself a religious person?'

Set in 1951, during the [[Korean War]], it follows Marcus Messner's departure from Newark to Ohio's Winesburg College, where he begins his sophomore year. In 2009, Roth's 30th book, ''[[The Humbling]]'', was published. It tells the story of the last performances of Simon Axler, a celebrated stage actor. Roth's 31st book, ''[[Nemesis (Philip Roth novel)|Nemesis]]'', was published on October 5, 2010. According to the book's notes, ''[[Nemesis (Philip Roth novel)|Nemesis]]'' is the last in a series of four \"short novels,\" after ''[[Everyman (novel)|Everyman]]'', ''[[Indignation (novel)|Indignation]]'' and ''[[The Humbling]]''. In October 2009, during an interview with [[Tina Brown]] of ''The Daily Beast'' to promote ''The Humbling'', Roth considered the future of literature and its place in society, stating his belief that within 25 years the reading of novels will be regarded as a \"cultic\" activity:\n\n<blockquote>I was being optimistic about 25 years really. I think it's going to be cultic. I think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people. Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range. ... To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you don't read the novel really. So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by\u2014it's hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities[.]<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title= Philip Roth predicts novel will be minority cult within 25 years |date=October 26, 2009 |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/26/philip-roth-novel-minority-cult}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen asked about the prospects for printed versus digital books, Roth was equally downbeat:\n\n<blockquote>The book can't compete with the screen.

Critic Jacques Berlinerblau noted in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' that these fictional voices create a complex and tricky experience for readers, deceiving them into believing they \"know\" Roth.<ref name = \"Berlinerblau\"/> In Roth's fiction the question of authorship is intertwined with the theme of the idealistic, secular Jewish son who attempts to distance himself from Jewish customs and traditions, and from what he perceives as the sometimes suffocating influence of parents, rabbis, and other community leaders.<ref name =\"GreenbergP11\" /> Roth's fiction has been described by critics as pervaded by \"a kind of alienation that is enlivened and exacerbated by what binds it\".<ref name=\"GreenbergP11\">Greenberg, Robert M. (Winter 1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150904132552/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n4_v43/ai_20614549/pg_11/ \"Transgression in the Fiction of Philip Roth\".] ''Twentieth Century Literature''.

In response, Roth, in his 1963 essay \"Writing About Jews\" (collected in ''Reading Myself and Others''), maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to Jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class Jewish Americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility:\n<blockquote>The cry 'Watch out for the goyim!' at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning: Oh that they were out there, so that we could be together here! A rumor of persecution, a taste of exile, might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habits\u2014something to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference, the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts, and where one cannot always figure out what a Jew is that a Christian is not.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=Philip |date=December 1963 |title=Writing About Jews |journal=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Roth's fiction the exploration of \"promiscuous instincts\" within the context of Jewish lives, mainly from a male viewpoint, plays an important role. In the words of critic [[Hermione Lee]]:\n<blockquote>Philip Roth's fiction strains to shed the burden of Jewish traditions and proscriptions. ... The liberated Jewish consciousness, let loose into the disintegration of the American Dream, finds itself deracinated and homeless. American society and politics, by the late sixties, are a grotesque travesty of what Jewish immigrants had traveled towards: liberty, peace, security, a decent liberal democracy.<ref name=\"Lee\">Lee, Hermione (1982). ''Philip Roth''. New York: Methuen & Co., 1982.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile Roth's fiction has strong autobiographical influences, it also incorporates social commentary and political satire, most obviously in ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' and ''[[Operation Shylock]]''. From the 1990s on Roth's fiction often combined autobiographical elements with retrospective dramatizations of postwar American life. Roth described ''[[American Pastoral]]'' and the two following novels as a loosely connected \"American trilogy\". Each of these novels treats aspects of the postwar era against the backdrop of the nostalgically remembered Jewish-American childhood of Nathan Zuckerman, in which the experience of life on [[United States home front during World War II|the American home front during the Second World War]] features prominently.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn much of Roth's fiction, the 1940s, comprising Roth's and Zuckerman's childhood, mark a high point of American idealism and social cohesion. A more satirical treatment of the patriotism and idealism of the war years is evident in Roth's comic novels, such as ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' and ''[[Sabbath's Theater]]''. In ''[[The Plot Against America]]'', the [[alternate history]] of the war years dramatizes the prevalence of [[anti-Semitism]] and racism in America at the time, despite the promotion of increasingly influential anti-racist ideals during the war. In his fiction Roth portrayed the 1940s, and the [[New Deal]] era of the 1930s that preceded it, as a heroic phase in American history. A sense of frustration with social and political developments in the United States since the 1940s is palpable in the American trilogy and ''[[Exit Ghost]]'', but had already been present in Roth's earlier works that contained political and social satire, such as ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'' and ''[[The Great American Novel (Roth)|The Great American Novel]]''. Writing about the latter, Hermione Lee points to the sense of disillusionment with \"the American Dream\" in Roth's fiction: \"The mythic words on which Roth's generation was brought up\u2014winning, patriotism, gamesmanship\u2014are desanctified; greed, fear, racism, and political ambition are disclosed as the motive forces behind the 'all-American ideals'.\"<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nAlthough Roth's writings often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth rejected being labeled a [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] writer. \"It's not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it's really not interesting,\" he told the [[The Guardian|Guardian newspaper]] in 2005. \"I'm an American.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-philiproth/pulitzer-winning-author-philip-roth-dies-at-85-says-agent-idUSKCN1IO0CM|title=Pulitzer-winning author Philip Roth dies at 85, says agent|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=May 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhile at [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], Roth met Margaret Martinson in 1956, who became his first wife in 1959. Their separation in 1963, and Martinson's subsequent death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's literary output.

''[[The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography]]''. New York, 1988.  Roth discusses Martinson's portrait in this memoir. He calls her \"Josie\" in ''[[When She Was Good]]'' on pp. 149 and 175. He discusses her as an inspiration for ''[[My Life as a Man]]'' throughout the book's second half, most completely in the chapter \"Girl of My Dreams,\" which includes this on p. 110: \"Why should I have tried to make up anything better? How could I?\" Her influence upon ''Portnoy's Complaint'' is seen in ''The Facts'' as more diffuse, a kind of loosening-up for the author:  \"It took time and it took blood, and not, really, until I began ''Portnoy's Complaint'' would I be able to cut loose with anything approaching her gift for flabbergasting boldness.\" (p. 149)</ref> \n\nRoth was an [[atheist]] who once said, \"When the whole world doesn't believe in God, it'll be a great place.\"<ref name=\"Ulysses Press\">{{cite book|title=The Wit and Blasphemy of Atheists: 500 Greatest Quips and Quotes from Freethinkers, Non-Believers and the Happily Damned|year=2011|publisher=Ulysses Press|isbn=978-1569759707|page=190|quote=When the whole world doesn't believe in God, it'll be a great place. \u2013 Philip Roth}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Roth on Fame, Sex and God|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philip-roth-on-fame-sex-and-god/|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=May 5, 2014|author=Rita Braver|quote='Do you consider yourself a religious person?'

If you look at the trajectory of the average novel writer, there is a learning period, then a period of high achievement, then the talent runs out and in middle age they start slowly to decline. People say why aren't Martin [Amis] and Julian [Barnes] getting on the Booker prize shortlist, but that's what happens in middle age. Philip Roth, though, gets better and better in middle age. In the 1990s he was almost incapable of not writing a masterpiece\u2014''The Human Stain'', ''The Plot Against America'', ''I Married a Communist''. He was 65\u201370 years old, what the hell's he doing writing that well?<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/18/judge-quits-philip-roth-booker | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Alison | last=Flood | title=Judge withdraws over Philip Roth's Booker win | date=May 18, 2011}}</ref></blockquote> In 2012 Roth received the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/en/news/entertainment/detail/900803/prince-asturias--philip-roth-wins-asturias-prize-literature/|title=US author Philip Roth wins Prince of Asturias prize for literature|last=EiTB|access-date=June 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803201451/http://www.eitb.com/en/news/entertainment/detail/900803/prince-asturias--philip-roth-wins-asturias-prize-literature/#|archive-date=August 3, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On March 19, 2013, his 80th birthday was celebrated in public ceremonies at the Newark Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/127998/four-score-and-philip-roth.|title=Four Score and Philip Roth|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Films===\nEight of Roth's novels and short stories have been adapted as films: ''[[Goodbye, Columbus (film)|Goodbye, Columbus]]''; ''[[Portnoy's Complaint (film)|Portnoy's Complaint]]''; ''[[The Human Stain (film)|The Human Stain]]''; ''[[The Dying Animal]],'' adapted as ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]''; ''[[The Humbling (film)|The Humbling]]''; ''[[Indignation (film)|Indignation]]''; and ''[[American Pastoral (film)|American Pastoral]]''.

He was the winner of the Mottard and Amic awards from the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] in 1987 and 2009 respectively, the [[Prix Renaudot]] in 2013 and the Prix Cazes in 2015. \n\nIn spite of having described his pedophile and sexual tourism activities in several of his books as well as on his official website. He remained sheltered from any criminal prosecution throughout his literary career and benefited from a wide and enthusiastic support within the French literary world and beyond - all that despite the fact that his books didn't sell well and that he was ignored by the general reading public.<ref>His best-seller, ''Ivre du Vin Perdu'' (1981) sold 20,000 copies. Most of his books sold between 1,500 and 2,000 copies and ''S\u00e9raphin, c'est la fin'', which earned him the prestigious Prix Renaudot in 2013, sold less than 4,000 copies.

According to information available on his official website, \u201chis parents divorced when he was six months old; throughout his childhood he never saw them in the same room, and would often be separated from his sister Alexandra and his brothers Andr\u00e9 and Nicolas. It was a childhood tossed to and fro, overshadowed by family breakdowns and war. It was a childhood which still causes him very painful memories.\"<ref>{{Cite web|lang=fr|title=La jeunesse de Gabriel Matzneff|trans-title=The youth of Gabriel Matzneff|url=http://www.matzneff.com/biographie.php|work=matzneff.com|date=2009|accessdate=30 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229181900/http://www.matzneff.com/biographie.php|archive-date=29 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHis family raised him in a refined cultural environment, rubbing shoulders with such famous French figures as [[L\u00e9on Chestov]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev|Nicolas Berdiaev]]. It is here he discovered literature and religion. Matzneff spent a year attending the Gerson private Catholic school (1943\u20131944), two in [[Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague]] (1944\u20131946), then moved to a school in Tannenberg from between 1946 and 1952, and from 1952 attended [[Lyc\u00e9e Carnot]].

{"title_page": "Immigration to Singapore", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n'''Immigration to Singapore''' is historically the main impetus for population growth in the country since the founding of modern Singapore in the early 19th century. Immigration and immigrant workers in [[Singapore]] have been closely associated with [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economic]] [[Economic development|development]]. For a long period after its founding, the majority of Singapore's population were immigrants. It was not until around the 1930s that the number of native births in Singapore would overtake net immigration. After [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|its expulsion from Malaysia in 1965]], immigration laws were modified in 1966 to reinforce Singapore's identity as a [[sovereign state]]. However, the initial strict controls on immigrant workers were relaxed as demand for [[Labour (economics)|labour]] grew with increased [[industrialisation]].  Immigration would again become the largest contributor to population increase in Singapore in the late 20th century and early 21st century.\n\nThe [[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority]] publishes a number of criteria for eligibility for permanent residence.<ref>[https://www.ica.gov.sg/apply/PR/apply_PR_who ICA - Becoming a permanent resident]</ref> In colonial times, British merchants and others moved to Singapore and helped develop the region. The large flow of migrants into Singapore in more recent times however has raised concerns and curbs on immigration have been introduced.<ref name=\"ST 2015\"/>\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:1em;\"\n|-\n|+ '''Population growth and immigration in selected periods'''<ref name=\"saw2\"/>\n|-\n!style=\"width:6em;\"| Period\n!style=\"width:7em;\"| Population increase\n!style=\"width:7em;\"| Natural Increase\n!style=\"width:7em;\"| Net Immigration\n|-\n|align=left|1881\u20131891\n| 43,857\n| \u221230,932{{ref|11|A}}\n| 74,798\n|-\n|align=left|1901\u20131911\n| 75,729\n| \u221259,978{{ref|11|A}}\n| 135,707\n|-\n|align=left|1921\u20131931\n| 139,387\n| 18,176\n| 212,211\n|-\n|align=left|1947\u20131957\n| 507,800\n| 395,600\n| 112,200\n|-\n|align=left|1970\u20131980\n| 339,400\n| 315,400\n| 24,000\n|-\n|align=left|1990\u20132000\n| 970,601\n| 330,030\n| 640,571\n|-\n|colspan=4|\n*<small>{{note|11|A}} Negative figures are due to low birth rate and high death rate</small>\n|}\n\n===Early immigration===\nEarly population figures show that, for a long period, the growth of population in Singapore was fuelled by immigration that started soon after [[Stamford Raffles]] landed in Singapore in 1819.  The founding of colonial Singapore as a free port led to a rapid influx of people, initially mostly Malays, quickly followed by Chinese. It was estimated that when Raffles arrived in Singapore on January 1819, Singapore had about 120 Malays, 30 Chinese and some local tribes such as the [[Orang Laut]]. Another estimate put the total population of Singapore at 1,000, mostly of various local tribes.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1utb8ZYyUeQC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Singapore in the Malay World: Building and Breaching Regional Bridges|authors= Lily Zubaidah Rahim, Lily Zubaidah Rahim |page=24 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |isbn= 9781134013975 }}</ref>  By 1821, the population was estimated to have increased to 4,724 Malays and 1,150 Chinese.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dD2qVu8EpdUC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Population of Singapore |edition=3rd |author= Saw Swee-Hock | publisher=ISEAS Publishing|date=30 June 2012|isbn= 978-9814380980 |page=7&ndash;8}}</ref> [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis]] and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] also began to arrive. In the first census of 1824, out of the 10,683 total, 6,505 were Malays and Bugis constituting over 60% of the population. The total population of Singapore then increased to 16,000 by 1829, 26,000 five years later, and 60,000 by the beginning of 1850.\n\nChinese migrants started to enter Singapore from the Straits area and southern China to trade just months after it became a British settlement.

Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for a large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, some of whom then settled in Singapore after their contracts ended.  By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians.

This and increasing job opportunities in Malaysia meant that the previous high level of movement of people between the two countries fell significantly. Net migration in Singapore dropped to 24,000 in the decade of 1970-80 due to tighter control of immigration from Malaysia and other countries. However, a lower rate of natural growth in population and the need for low-skill labour resulted in a deliberate shift in policy by the Singapore government to allow more foreigners to live and work in the country, and net migration increased in the 1980-1990 period to nearly 200,000. By the decade of 1990-2000, the net migrant number of over 600,000 had surpassed the natural growth of the population, and accounted for nearly two-third of the population increase.

''Foreign workers'' refers to semi-[[Skill (labor)|skilled]] or unskilled workers who mainly work in the manufacturing, construction, and [[domestic service]]s sectors. The majority of them come from places such as People's Republic of China,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clb.org.hk/en/node/100977 |title=Hired on Sufferance: China\u2019s migrant workers in Singapore |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727232521/http://www.clb.org.hk/en/node/100977 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |work=Chinese Labour Bulletin |date=10 February 2011}}</ref> Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Thailand, as part of bilateral agreements between Singapore and these countries. ''Foreign talent'' refers to foreigners with professional qualifications or acceptable degrees working at the higher end of Singapore's economy. They mostly come from India, Australia, the Philippines, People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Europe, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIn September 1998 the [[Government of Singapore|Singaporean government]] first constructed a system under which different types of employment passes (EP) are issued to immigrant workers according to their qualifications and monthly salaries. The \"P, Q, R\" employment pass system was put into practice in September 1998; a new \"S\" type employment pass was later introduced in July 2004. The government has also set different policies on recruiting foreign talents and foreign workers.\n\nIn 2014, the Ministry of Manpower did away with their pass type category, however, the criteria remains the same.  From 1 January 2017, new EP applicants will have to earn a fixed monthly salary of $3,600 or more, depending on their qualifications and experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/eligibility |title=Eligibility for Employment Pass|work=Ministry of Manpower}}</ref>\n\nThe different policies towards 'Foreign workers' and 'Foreign talent' in Singapore have led some people to feel that their contributions toward Singapore's development are valued differently. However, the Singapore government has always stressed the importance of immigrant workers to [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economy]] and development. [[Senior Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]], then [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], said in his 1997 [[National Day]] rally speech that the government's lack of restrictions on the recruitment of foreigners did not extend only to top-rung prestigious positions, but also to middle-level management, skilled worker and technician positions.{{sfn|Low|2002}}\n\n===Foreign talent===\nVarious policies and incentives are used to attract foreign talent to Singapore.

In 1981, the government even announced its intention to phase out all unskilled foreign workers by the end of 1991, except domestic maids and those employed in construction and [[shipyard]]s. The policy stance was met with strong protests from employers facing [[labour shortage]]s.{{sfn|Athukorala|Manning|1999}}\n\nIn April 1987, the Singapore government announced its [[immigration policy]], which intended to control the foreign worker inflow. The two key elements in the policy were a monthly levy payable by the employer for each foreign worker employed, and a \"dependency ceiling\" that limits the proportion of foreign workers in the total workforce of any one employer. The government later introduced a two-tier levy system in October 1991 under which employers were required to pay a higher levy on workers whose employment would change the \"dependent ceiling\" value of the company.{{sfn|Athukorala|Manning|1999}}  The levy and the \"dependency ceiling\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Changes To Foreign Workers Levy 2015|url=http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-coretrade-levy/|publisher=Aesperon - Changes to Foreign Workers Levy and Quota in 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811180940/http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-coretrade-levy/|archivedate=11 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> have remained the two instruments with which the government has regulated worker inflow in line with changes in domestic [[Labour economics|labour-market]] conditions.{{sfn|Athukorala|Manning|1999}}\n\n*[http://www.aseanhrmech.org/downloads/singapore-Immigration_Act_Of_Singapore.pdf Immigration Act]\n\nNon-residents working in Singapore will require a work visa.

Immigration and immigrant workers in [[Singapore]] have been closely associated with [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economic]] [[Economic development|development]]. For a long period after its founding, the majority of Singapore's population were immigrants. It was not until around the 1930s that the number of native births in Singapore would overtake net immigration. After [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|its expulsion from Malaysia in 1965]], immigration laws were modified in 1966 to reinforce Singapore's identity as a [[sovereign state]]. However, the initial strict controls on immigrant workers were relaxed as demand for [[Labour (economics)|labour]] grew with increased [[industrialisation]].  Immigration would again become the largest contributor to population increase in Singapore in the late 20th century and early 21st century.\n\nThe [[Immigration and Checkpoints Authority]] publishes a number of criteria for eligibility for permanent residence.<ref>[https://www.ica.gov.sg/apply/PR/apply_PR_who ICA - Becoming a permanent resident]</ref> In colonial times, British merchants and others moved to Singapore and helped develop the region.

The founding of colonial Singapore as a free port led to a rapid influx of people, initially mostly Malays, quickly followed by Chinese. It was estimated that when Raffles arrived in Singapore on January 1819, Singapore had about 120 Malays, 30 Chinese and some local tribes such as the [[Orang Laut]]. Another estimate put the total population of Singapore at 1,000, mostly of various local tribes.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1utb8ZYyUeQC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Singapore in the Malay World: Building and Breaching Regional Bridges|authors= Lily Zubaidah Rahim, Lily Zubaidah Rahim |page=24 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |isbn= 9781134013975 }}</ref>  By 1821, the population was estimated to have increased to 4,724 Malays and 1,150 Chinese.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dD2qVu8EpdUC&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Population of Singapore |edition=3rd |author= Saw Swee-Hock | publisher=ISEAS Publishing|date=30 June 2012|isbn= 978-9814380980 |page=7&ndash;8}}</ref> [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Bugis]] and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] also began to arrive. In the first census of 1824, out of the 10,683 total, 6,505 were Malays and Bugis constituting over 60% of the population. The total population of Singapore then increased to 16,000 by 1829, 26,000 five years later, and 60,000 by the beginning of 1850.\n\nChinese migrants started to enter Singapore from the Straits area and southern China to trade just months after it became a British settlement.  Later migrant workers from China would also increase considerably to work on the pepper and [[Uncaria gambir|gambier]] plantations, with 11,000 recorded in one year.<ref name=\"sanderson\"/> Indian migrants also arrived, mostly from [[Bengal]] and the [[Coromandel Coast]]. Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for a large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, some of whom then settled in Singapore after their contracts ended.  By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians.  The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and it showed that Chinese were the largest ethnic group at 57.6%.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wVyqbmHS2zQC&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Rickshaw Coolie: A People's History of Singapore, 1880-1940 |author= James Francis Warren|page=18 |publisher=NUS Press |date=30 June 2003|isbn=978-9971692667 }}</ref>  In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555,<ref name=\"sanderson\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023134368#page/n227/mode/2up |editors=Wright, Arnold and Cartwright, H.A. |author=Mrs Reginald Sanderson|date= 1907|title=Twentieth century impressions of British Malaya: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources |pages=220\u2013221 }}</ref> with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians.

This and increasing job opportunities in Malaysia meant that the previous high level of movement of people between the two countries fell significantly. Net migration in Singapore dropped to 24,000 in the decade of 1970-80 due to tighter control of immigration from Malaysia and other countries. However, a lower rate of natural growth in population and the need for low-skill labour resulted in a deliberate shift in policy by the Singapore government to allow more foreigners to live and work in the country, and net migration increased in the 1980-1990 period to nearly 200,000. By the decade of 1990-2000, the net migrant number of over 600,000 had surpassed the natural growth of the population, and accounted for nearly two-third of the population increase.

''Foreign workers'' refers to semi-[[Skill (labor)|skilled]] or unskilled workers who mainly work in the manufacturing, construction, and [[domestic service]]s sectors. The majority of them come from places such as People's Republic of China,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clb.org.hk/en/node/100977 |title=Hired on Sufferance: China\u2019s migrant workers in Singapore |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727232521/http://www.clb.org.hk/en/node/100977 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |work=Chinese Labour Bulletin |date=10 February 2011}}</ref> Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Thailand, as part of bilateral agreements between Singapore and these countries. ''Foreign talent'' refers to foreigners with professional qualifications or acceptable degrees working at the higher end of Singapore's economy. They mostly come from India, Australia, the Philippines, People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Europe, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIn September 1998 the [[Government of Singapore|Singaporean government]] first constructed a system under which different types of employment passes (EP) are issued to immigrant workers according to their qualifications and monthly salaries. The \"P, Q, R\" employment pass system was put into practice in September 1998; a new \"S\" type employment pass was later introduced in July 2004. The government has also set different policies on recruiting foreign talents and foreign workers.\n\nIn 2014, the Ministry of Manpower did away with their pass type category, however, the criteria remains the same.  From 1 January 2017, new EP applicants will have to earn a fixed monthly salary of $3,600 or more, depending on their qualifications and experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/employment-pass/eligibility |title=Eligibility for Employment Pass|work=Ministry of Manpower}}</ref>\n\nThe different policies towards 'Foreign workers' and 'Foreign talent' in Singapore have led some people to feel that their contributions toward Singapore's development are valued differently. However, the Singapore government has always stressed the importance of immigrant workers to [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economy]] and development. [[Senior Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]], then [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]], said in his 1997 [[National Day]] rally speech that the government's lack of restrictions on the recruitment of foreigners did not extend only to top-rung prestigious positions, but also to middle-level management, skilled worker and technician positions.{{sfn|Low|2002}}\n\n===Foreign talent===\nVarious policies and incentives are used to attract foreign talent to Singapore.

In 1981, the government even announced its intention to phase out all unskilled foreign workers by the end of 1991, except domestic maids and those employed in construction and [[shipyard]]s.

The two key elements in the policy were a monthly levy payable by the employer for each foreign worker employed, and a \"dependency ceiling\" that limits the proportion of foreign workers in the total workforce of any one employer. The government later introduced a two-tier levy system in October 1991 under which employers were required to pay a higher levy on workers whose employment would change the \"dependent ceiling\" value of the company.{{sfn|Athukorala|Manning|1999}}  The levy and the \"dependency ceiling\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Changes To Foreign Workers Levy 2015|url=http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-coretrade-levy/|publisher=Aesperon - Changes to Foreign Workers Levy and Quota in 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811180940/http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-coretrade-levy/|archivedate=11 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> have remained the two instruments with which the government has regulated worker inflow in line with changes in domestic [[Labour economics|labour-market]] conditions.{{sfn|Athukorala|Manning|1999}}\n\n*[http://www.aseanhrmech.org/downloads/singapore-Immigration_Act_Of_Singapore.pdf Immigration Act]\n\nNon-residents working in Singapore will require a work visa.

British Columbians were asked which electoral system should be used to elect legislators: the existing first-past-the-post electoral system or the proposed BC-STV system.\n\nThe adoption of BC-STV in the 2009 referendum was defeated, with 60.9% voting against the reform and 39.09% of voters supporting the change.<ref>{{cite web |last=Elections BC |title=Statement of Votes \u2013 Referendum on Electoral Reform |date=May 12, 2009 |page=20 |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/2009Ref/2009-Ref-SOV.pdf |access-date=4 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423200639/http://elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/2009Ref/2009-Ref-SOV.pdf# |archive-date=23 April 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Intervening federal developments===\nDuring the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], [[Justin Trudeau]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] campaigned on the promise that it would be the last federal election under the first-past-the-post electoral system.

This was British Columbia's third referendum on electoral reform since 2005.\n\nVoters were asked two questions: first, what electoral system should be used to determine election results\u2014the existing [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) system or a [[proportional representation]] (PR) system; and second, what type of proportional voting system should be used if PR is chosen. In the second question, voters were asked to rank three proportional representation voting systems: [[dual-member proportional representation]], [[mixed-member proportional representation]], and [[rural\u2013urban proportional representation]].\n\nThe referendum fulfilled an election commitment by the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] (NDP) during the 2017 election. Their platform promised a referendum and that the government would actively campaign for electoral reform.\n\nResults were released by [[Elections BC]] on December 20, 2018. British Columbians voted in favour of maintaining the first-past-the-post voting system rather than switching to a proportional representation voting system.\n\n==Background==\nBC has a long history of changing its electoral system. For BC's first election in 1871, the majority of ridings were elected using an \"at large\" system. This is the way city councillors are elected in BC to this day: a voter gets as many votes as there were people to be elected in the riding.<ref name=1871-1986>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC|Elections British Columbia]] |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871\u20131986 |date=1988 |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613200446/http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf# |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOver its history, BC modified its electoral system at least 15 times without a referendum.<ref name=1871-1986 /> It previously used an [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative voting system]] in the [[1952 British Columbia general election|1952 provincial election]] before abolishing it and reestablishing the previous mix of \"at large\" and first-past-the-post.<ref name=\"pdennis\">{{Cite book |title=The politics of voting : reforming Canada's electoral system |last=Pilon |first=Dennis |date=2007 |publisher=Emond Montgomery Publications |isbn=9781552392362 |location=Toronto |oclc=150223313}}</ref>{{rp|81\u201382}}<ref>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC|Elections British Columbia]] |title=Electoral History of British Columbia 1871\u20131986 |date=1988 |url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf |access-date=21 June 2018 |pages=231\u2013232 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613200446/http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf# |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first BC election done entirely under first-past-the-post came in 1991, after the last \"at-large\" voting districts had been abolished.<ref name=\"pdennis\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC]] |title=Electoral History of B.C. |date=2018 |url=http://elections.bc.ca/resources/learning-about-elections/electoral-history-of-bc/ |access-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626030841/http://elections.bc.ca/resources/learning-about-elections/electoral-history-of-bc/# |archive-date=26 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The multi-member at-large ridings were abolished after the 1986 election due to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that found them unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web |last=[[Elections BC]] |title=Electoral History of B.C. |date=2018 |url=http://elections.bc.ca/resources/learning-about-elections/electoral-history-of-bc/}}</ref>\n\n\n===Previous referendums===\nBefore the [[2001 British Columbia general election|2001 provincial election]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal Party]] committed to appoint a [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|Citizens' Assembly]] to investigate electoral reform, hold consultations, and prepare a report recommending whether a different [[electoral system]] should be adopted.<ref name=CAReport>{{cite web |title=Making Every Vote Count: The Case for Electoral Reform in British Columbia |url=http://www.citizensassembly.bc.ca:80/resources/final_report.pdf |date=December 2004 |access-date=15 June 2018 |author=[[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|British Columbia Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform]] |publisher=Government of British Columbia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513192722/http://www.citizensassembly.bc.ca/resources/final_report.pdf# |archive-date=13 May 2005}}</ref> The commitment was driven in part by the anomalous provincial election result in [[1996 British Columbia general election|1996]], in which the BC New Democratic Party won reelection as a majority government with 39.5% of the vote and 39 seats, despite gaining a 3% smaller share of the popular vote than the Liberals at 41.8%, which translated into 33 Liberal seats.<ref name=\"pdennis\"/>{{rp|90\u201391}} In December 2004, the Assembly released its report recommending that the province adopt [[BC-STV]], a BC-specific variant of the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system.<ref name=CAReport /> On May 17, 2005, a [[2005 British Columbia electoral reform referendum|referendum]] was held in conjunction with the [[2005 British Columbia general election|2005 general election]], in which voters were asked whether the province should adopt the recommendation of the Assembly to replace the first-past-the-post electoral system with BC-STV, or maintain the current system.
