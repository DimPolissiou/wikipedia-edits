The current organisers of the award are ''[[Auto (magazine)|Auto]]'' (Italy), ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' (United Kingdom), ''[[Autopista (magazine)|Autopista]]'' (Spain), ''[[Autovisie]]'' (Netherlands), ''[[L'Automobile Magazine]]'' (France), ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (Germany) and ''[[Vi Bil\u00e4gare]]'' (Sweden).<ref>{{cite web|title=Organizing magazines|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/organization|work=Car of the Year|accessdate=24 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208151612/http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/organization|archivedate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe voting [[jury]] consists of motoring [[journalist]]s from publications throughout Europe. Representation from each country is based on the size of the country's car market, and car manufacturing industry. There are no categories or class winners \u2014 the stated objective is to find a \"single, decisive winner\" among all competing cars.\n\nThe 2020 ECOTY was announced on March 2, 2020, at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the winner being the [[Peugeot 208]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=English|date=2 March 2020|title=All-New Peugeot 208 wins European Car of the Year 2020|url=https://www.charterspeugeot.com/news/all-new-peugeot-208-wins-european-car-of-the-year-2020/|work=Charters Peugeot|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Current rules==\nEligible cars are new models released in the twelve months prior to the award. The award is not restricted to European cars, but nominees must be available in at least five European countries, and have expected sales of 5,000 a year.\n\nNominees are judged on the following criteria: design, comfort, safety, economy, handling, performance, functionality, environmental requirements, driver satisfaction and price. Technical innovation and value for money are also important factors.<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/our-spirit|title=What makes a Car of the Year?|accessdate=2010-11-20|work=caroftheyear.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101134816/http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/our-spirit|archive-date=2011-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA shortlist of seven cars is selected by a simple vote. For the final round of voting, each jury member has 25 points to distribute among the finalists. The points must be distributed to at least five cars, with no more than ten to any one car, and no joint top marks. The voting is open, and each jury member provides published justification for their vote distribution.\n\nUnder these rules, the decisiveness of the victory has varied greatly. For example, in 1988, the '''Peugeot 405''' won by 212 points, the biggest gap in the history of the ''European Car of the Year'' competition; such feat was repeated in 2013, as the Mk VII '''Volkswagen Golf''' won by the same points gap. In 2010 the '''Volkswagen Polo''' won by a mere 10 points, received maximum points from twenty-five jurors, and was the top choice of 59.\n\nThe [[Renault Clio]] (1991, 2006), [[Volkswagen Golf]] (1992, 2013), and [[Opel Astra|Opel/Vauxhall Astra]] (1985, 2016), are the only cars to have won the award more than once.\n\nIn November 2010, the [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electrically-powered vehicle to be awarded ''Car of the Year''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/25/nissan-leaf-gets-european-car-of-the-year-first-ever-for-an-electric-car/|title=Nissan Leaf Gets European Car Of The Year, First Ever For An Electric Car|last=Contributor|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/nissan-leaf-takes-european-car-of-the-year-2150500.html|title=Nissan Leaf takes European Car of the Year|date=2010-12-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Ian Callum, COTY 2019, Le Grand-Saconnex (GIMS9894).jpg|thumb|upright|Jaguar Chief of Design [[Ian Callum]] holds the Car of the Year 2019 trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace]]\nBritish carmakers produced the first two winners of the award. The [[Rover P6|Rover 2000]] saloon was the inaugural winner in 1964 while the [[BMC ADO17|Austin 1800]] was victorious in 1965. The Rover won over another British contender, the rear-engine [[Hillman Imp]].\n\nThe [[Renault 16]] was the world's first production hatchback car {{Disputed inline|Disputed|date=December 2017}} and unsurprisingly won the award for 1966, having been launched at the beginning of 1965. A year later, the award went to the Fiat 124, which won more than twice as many as voted as its nearest competitor, the BMW 1600. Fiat missed out the following year, however, when its 125 was pipped to the award by the revolutionary new NSU Ro80, one of the first production cars to feature a rotary engine.\n\nPeugeot claimed the accolade for the first time with the 1969 award, which was won by its 504 saloon, a large family car which offered a high standard of interior comfort and build quality. The Fiat 128 was the next winner of the award, while a year later the innovative new Citroen GS family saloon won the award.\n\nFiat became the first manufacturer to win the award for a third time when its 127 supermini won the 1972 title. The next winner of the award was the Audi 80, and the 1974 award went to the Mercedes-Benz 450SE luxury saloon.\n\nDespite financial problems which led to its takeover by Peugeot that year, Citroen won the accolade in 1975 with its flagship CX saloon, which fought off a strong challenge from the highly acclaimed Volkswagen Golf. Then came [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler Europe's]] first winner of the award, the contemporary Simca 1307/1308 (Chrysler Alpine in the United Kingdom). Despite all the strife which troubled [[British Leyland]] throughout the 1970s, the state-owned carmaker achieved recognition for 1977 when its [[Rover SD1|Rover 3500]] executive car won the award.  This was the last time a British marque would win the contest (discounting the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] models which were [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] Opels) - until the Jaguar I-Pace took the crown in 2019.\n\nSports cars have traditionally accounted for only a tiny percentage of car sales throughout Europe, but the European Car of the Year accolade was won by one for 1978, when the Porsche 928 sealed the award in the face of competition from the BMW 7 Series and Ford Granada.\n\nJust before the sale of its European division to Peugeot, Chrysler achieved a success second in the contest with its Horizon, which won the 1979 award ahead of one of its main rivals, Fiat Ritmo/Strada. Lancia finally achieved recognition a year later when its stylish new Delta hatchback was voted European Car of the Year.\n\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] finally achieved success in the contest when its MK3 Escort, the first of that model line to feature front-wheel drive or a hatchback, sealed the award for 1981, fighting off competition from British Leyland's crucial Austin Metro supermini and the Fiat Panda. A year later, the accolade was perhaps surprisingly won by the Renault 9, which managed to finish ahead of the more widely well regarded Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier and the MK2 Volkswagen Polo. The 1983 award was won by the Audi 100, which narrowly finished ahead of the slightly smaller and similarly aerodynamic Ford Sierra.\n\nThe 1984 award saw two new superminis finish well ahead of the nearest contenders. The Fiat Uno was Fiat's fourth success in the history of the award, finishing slightly ahead of the Peugeot 205. A year later, [[General Motors]] finally achieved recognition when its latest version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra sealed it. Ford achieved a second victory in the 1986 contest with its new Scorpio/Granada flagship Which unsuccessful in the American market. General Motors made it two victories in three years when its own flagship model, the Opel Omega/[[Vauxhall Carlton]], won the award for 1987.\n\n19 years after the 504 gave Peugeot its first European Car of the Year, the French carmaker finally enjoyed its second triumph in the competition when its mid-range 405 saloon won the 1988 award by a wide margin. A year later, Fiat became the first manufacturer to win the award five times when its ground-breaking new Tipo achieved victory.\n\nCitroen's new XM flagship model won the award for 1990, with its French rival Renault scoring success a year later with the new Clio supermini, which signalled the end for the iconic R5. With the award now nearly 30 years old, Volkswagen finally achieved recognition in 1992 when its MK3 Golf won the award, finishing ahead of two of its most important competitors - the Vauxhall/Opel Astra and Citroen ZX.\n\nA non-European brand - with a British-built product - won the award for the first time for 1993, when the Nissan Micra earned top marks ahead of the Fiat Cinquecento (a car which helped the popularity of city cars in Europe to soar over the next few years) and Renault's new flagship, the Safrane.\n\nFord achieved a third success in the competition with its Mondeo, successor to the Sierra, winning the award for 1994. Fiat increased its number of victories in the contest to six, when its new Punto supermini won the award for 1995, just as its Uno and 127 ancestors had done many years earlier. Fiat made it seven victories a year later when its Bravo/Brava range pipped the stylish Peugeot 406 to the honour.\n\nRenault's innovative compact MPV, the Scenic, won the ECOTY And Japan Import Car of the Year for 1997, while The Fiat subsidiary [[Alfa Romeo]] won the next year's award for the first time with its 156 mid-range sports saloon.\n\nFord achieved a fourth success in the contest when its boldly-styled Focus won the 1999 award, fighting off competition from the latest Vauxhall/Opel Astra as well as Peugeot's stylish 206 supermini. A year later, a Japanese manufacturer - this time with a Japanese-built product - won the award when the [[Toyota Yaris]] Hatchback and [[Toyota Yaris Verso|Yaris Verso]] Mini MPV earned top marks in Car of the Year Japan and ECOTY ahead of the boldly-styled Fiat Multipla and the practical Vauxhall/Opel Zafira compact MPV.\n\nAlfa Romeo's modern revival continued when its stylish 147 won the award for 2001, with the next winner being the Peugeot 307. It was another French success for 2003, when the second generation Renault Megane was the winner.\n\nFiat achieved its eighth success in the contest when its all-new Panda won the 2004 award. Toyota made it two victories from six years when its radical Prius hybrid won the 2005 award. The Renault Clio became the first model to win the award twice when the third generation of the popular supermini won it for 2006, having previously won in 1991.\n\nFord's stylish and practical S-MAX won the 2007 award, fighting off a close challenge from the Vauxhall/Opel Corsa, earlier versions of which had been largely overlooked by the contest's judges.\n\nFiat made in nine victories in the contest when it won the 2008 award with the 500 model, a retro-styled take on its iconic small car which had first been launched 50 years earlier. The next award went to a more traditional and mainstream offering, when Vauxhall/Opel won the award for only the third time with its Insignia.\n\nVolkswagen's Polo supermini had been around in several forms since its launch in the mid 1970s, but the all-new version launched in 2009 was the first generation of Polo to win this award, and only the second Volkswagen-badged car ever to win it.\n\nThen came two years of success for electric-powered cars, with the British-built Nissan Leaf and United States-built (Opel) Vauxhall Ampera/Chevrolet Volt winning the 2011 and 2012 award respectively.\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf (having previously won in 1992) then joined the Renault Clio with the distinction of two wins in the contest when the MK7 version won the 2013 award. One of the Golf's key rivals, the Peugeot 308, was the next winner. In 2015, was awarded the Volkswagen Passat. In 2016, the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, another key rival to the Golf, became the third automobile to win the award twice, having previously won in 1985.\n\nIn 2017 Peugeot won with the fifth time with the crossover 3008.\n\nThe 2018 winner announced on 5 March is for a Swedish manufacturer for the first time in the history of the competition, with the Volvo XC40 winning.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"  style=\"background:Gainsboro; text-align:center;\"| '''''European Car of the Year'''''\n|-\n!

international award established in 1964, by a collective of [[Magazine|automobile magazine]]s from different countries in Europe. The current organisers of the award are ''[[Auto (magazine)|Auto]]'' (Italy), ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' (United Kingdom), ''[[Autopista (magazine)|Autopista]]'' (Spain), ''[[Autovisie]]'' (Netherlands), ''[[L'Automobile Magazine]]'' (France), ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (Germany) and ''[[Vi Bil\u00e4gare]]'' (Sweden).<ref>{{cite web|title=Organizing magazines|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/organization|work=Car of the Year|accessdate=24 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208151612/http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/organization|archivedate=8 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe voting [[jury]] consists of motoring [[journalist]]s from publications throughout Europe. Representation from each country is based on the size of the country's car market, and car manufacturing industry. There are no categories or class winners \u2014 the stated objective is to find a \"single, decisive winner\" among all competing cars.\n\nThe 2020 ECOTY was announced on March 2, 2020, at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the winner being the [[Peugeot 208]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=English|date=2 March 2020|title=All-New Peugeot 208 wins European Car of the Year 2020|url=https://www.charterspeugeot.com/news/all-new-peugeot-208-wins-european-car-of-the-year-2020/|work=Charters Peugeot|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Current rules==\nEligible cars are new models released in the twelve months prior to the award. The award is not restricted to European cars, but nominees must be available in at least five European countries, and have expected sales of 5,000 a year.\n\nNominees are judged on the following criteria: design, comfort, safety, economy, handling, performance, functionality, environmental requirements, driver satisfaction and price. Technical innovation and value for money are also important factors.<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/our-spirit|title=What makes a Car of the Year?|accessdate=2010-11-20|work=caroftheyear.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101134816/http://www.caroftheyear.org/auto/our-spirit|archive-date=2011-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA shortlist of seven cars is selected by a simple vote. For the final round of voting, each jury member has 25 points to distribute among the finalists. The points must be distributed to at least five cars, with no more than ten to any one car, and no joint top marks. The voting is open, and each jury member provides published justification for their vote distribution.\n\nUnder these rules, the decisiveness of the victory has varied greatly. For example, in 1988, the '''Peugeot 405''' won by 212 points, the biggest gap in the history of the ''European Car of the Year'' competition; such feat was repeated in 2013, as the Mk VII '''Volkswagen Golf''' won by the same points gap. In 2010 the '''Volkswagen Polo''' won by a mere 10 points, received maximum points from twenty-five jurors, and was the top choice of 59.\n\nThe [[Renault Clio]] (1991, 2006), [[Volkswagen Golf]] (1992, 2013), and [[Opel Astra|Opel/Vauxhall Astra]] (1985, 2016), are the only cars to have won the award more than once.\n\nIn November 2010, the [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electrically-powered vehicle to be awarded ''Car of the Year''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/25/nissan-leaf-gets-european-car-of-the-year-first-ever-for-an-electric-car/|title=Nissan Leaf Gets European Car Of The Year, First Ever For An Electric Car|last=Contributor|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/nissan-leaf-takes-european-car-of-the-year-2150500.html|title=Nissan Leaf takes European Car of the Year|date=2010-12-03|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Ian Callum, COTY 2019, Le Grand-Saconnex (GIMS9894).jpg|thumb|upright|Jaguar Chief of Design [[Ian Callum]] holds the Car of the Year 2019 trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace]]\nBritish carmakers produced the first two winners of the award. The [[Rover P6|Rover 2000]] saloon was the inaugural winner in 1964 while the [[BMC ADO17|Austin 1800]] was victorious in 1965. The Rover won over another British contender, the rear-engine [[Hillman Imp]].\n\nThe [[Renault 16]] was the world's first production hatchback car {{Disputed inline|Disputed|date=December 2017}} and unsurprisingly won the award for 1966, having been launched at the beginning of 1965. A year later, the award went to the Fiat 124, which won more than twice as many as voted as its nearest competitor, the BMW 1600. Fiat missed out the following year, however, when its 125 was pipped to the award by the revolutionary new NSU Ro80, one of the first production cars to feature a rotary engine.\n\nPeugeot claimed the accolade for the first time with the 1969 award, which was won by its 504 saloon, a large family car which offered a high standard of interior comfort and build quality. The Fiat 128 was the next winner of the award, while a year later the innovative new Citroen GS family saloon won the award.\n\nFiat became the first manufacturer to win the award for a third time when its 127 supermini won the 1972 title. The next winner of the award was the Audi 80, and the 1974 award went to the Mercedes-Benz 450SE luxury saloon.\n\nDespite financial problems which led to its takeover by Peugeot that year, Citroen won the accolade in 1975 with its flagship CX saloon, which fought off a strong challenge from the highly acclaimed Volkswagen Golf. Then came [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler Europe's]] first winner of the award, the contemporary Simca 1307/1308 (Chrysler Alpine in the United Kingdom). Despite all the strife which troubled [[British Leyland]] throughout the 1970s, the state-owned carmaker achieved recognition for 1977 when its [[Rover SD1|Rover 3500]] executive car won the award.  This was the last time a British marque would win the contest (discounting the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] models which were [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] Opels) - until the Jaguar I-Pace took the crown in 2019.\n\nSports cars have traditionally accounted for only a tiny percentage of car sales throughout Europe, but the European Car of the Year accolade was won by one for 1978, when the Porsche 928 sealed the award in the face of competition from the BMW 7 Series and Ford Granada.\n\nJust before the sale of its European division to Peugeot, Chrysler achieved a success second in the contest with its Horizon, which won the 1979 award ahead of one of its main rivals, Fiat Ritmo/Strada. Lancia finally achieved recognition a year later when its stylish new Delta hatchback was voted European Car of the Year.\n\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] finally achieved success in the contest when its MK3 Escort, the first of that model line to feature front-wheel drive or a hatchback, sealed the award for 1981, fighting off competition from British Leyland's crucial Austin Metro supermini and the Fiat Panda. A year later, the accolade was perhaps surprisingly won by the Renault 9, which managed to finish ahead of the more widely well regarded Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier and the MK2 Volkswagen Polo. The 1983 award was won by the Audi 100, which narrowly finished ahead of the slightly smaller and similarly aerodynamic Ford Sierra.\n\nThe 1984 award saw two new superminis finish well ahead of the nearest contenders. The Fiat Uno was Fiat's fourth success in the history of the award, finishing slightly ahead of the Peugeot 205. A year later, [[General Motors]] finally achieved recognition when its latest version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra sealed it. Ford achieved a second victory in the 1986 contest with its new Scorpio/Granada flagship Which unsuccessful in the American market. General Motors made it two victories in three years when its own flagship model, the Opel Omega/[[Vauxhall Carlton]], won the award for 1987.\n\n19 years after the 504 gave Peugeot its first European Car of the Year, the French carmaker finally enjoyed its second triumph in the competition when its mid-range 405 saloon won the 1988 award by a wide margin. A year later, Fiat became the first manufacturer to win the award five times when its ground-breaking new Tipo achieved victory.\n\nCitroen's new XM flagship model won the award for 1990, with its French rival Renault scoring success a year later with the new Clio supermini, which signalled the end for the iconic R5. With the award now nearly 30 years old, Volkswagen finally achieved recognition in 1992 when its MK3 Golf won the award, finishing ahead of two of its most important competitors - the Vauxhall/Opel Astra and Citroen ZX.\n\nA non-European brand - with a British-built product - won the award for the first time for 1993, when the Nissan Micra earned top marks ahead of the Fiat Cinquecento (a car which helped the popularity of city cars in Europe to soar over the next few years) and Renault's new flagship, the Safrane.\n\nFord achieved a third success in the competition with its Mondeo, successor to the Sierra, winning the award for 1994. Fiat increased its number of victories in the contest to six, when its new Punto supermini won the award for 1995, just as its Uno and 127 ancestors had done many years earlier. Fiat made it seven victories a year later when its Bravo/Brava range pipped the stylish Peugeot 406 to the honour.\n\nRenault's innovative compact MPV, the Scenic, won the ECOTY And Japan Import Car of the Year for 1997, while The Fiat subsidiary [[Alfa Romeo]] won the next year's award for the first time with its 156 mid-range sports saloon.\n\nFord achieved a fourth success in the contest when its boldly-styled Focus won the 1999 award, fighting off competition from the latest Vauxhall/Opel Astra as well as Peugeot's stylish 206 supermini. A year later, a Japanese manufacturer - this time with a Japanese-built product - won the award when the [[Toyota Yaris]] Hatchback and [[Toyota Yaris Verso|Yaris Verso]] Mini MPV earned top marks in Car of the Year Japan and ECOTY ahead of the boldly-styled Fiat Multipla and the practical Vauxhall/Opel Zafira compact MPV.\n\nAlfa Romeo's modern revival continued when its stylish 147 won the award for 2001, with the next winner being the Peugeot 307. It was another French success for 2003, when the second generation Renault Megane was the winner.\n\nFiat achieved its eighth success in the contest when its all-new Panda won the 2004 award. Toyota made it two victories from six years when its radical Prius hybrid won the 2005 award. The Renault Clio became the first model to win the award twice when the third generation of the popular supermini won it for 2006, having previously won in 1991.\n\nFord's stylish and practical S-MAX won the 2007 award, fighting off a close challenge from the Vauxhall/Opel Corsa, earlier versions of which had been largely overlooked by the contest's judges.\n\nFiat made in nine victories in the contest when it won the 2008 award with the 500 model, a retro-styled take on its iconic small car which had first been launched 50 years earlier. The next award went to a more traditional and mainstream offering, when Vauxhall/Opel won the award for only the third time with its Insignia.\n\nVolkswagen's Polo supermini had been around in several forms since its launch in the mid 1970s, but the all-new version launched in 2009 was the first generation of Polo to win this award, and only the second Volkswagen-badged car ever to win it.\n\nThen came two years of success for electric-powered cars, with the British-built Nissan Leaf and United States-built (Opel) Vauxhall Ampera/Chevrolet Volt winning the 2011 and 2012 award respectively.\n\nThe Volkswagen Golf (having previously won in 1992) then joined the Renault Clio with the distinction of two wins in the contest when the MK7 version won the 2013 award. One of the Golf's key rivals, the Peugeot 308, was the next winner. In 2015, was awarded the Volkswagen Passat. In 2016, the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, another key rival to the Golf, became the third automobile to win the award twice, having previously won in 1985.\n\nIn 2017 Peugeot won with the fifth time with the crossover 3008.\n\nThe 2018 winner announced on 5 March is for a Swedish manufacturer for the first time in the history of the competition, with the Volvo XC40 winning.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"  style=\"background:Gainsboro; text-align:center;\"| '''''European Car of the Year'''''\n|-\n!

A [[web browser]], for example, may be the ''client'' and an application running on a computer [[Host (network)|hosting]] a [[website]] may be the ''server''. The client submits an HTTP ''request'' message to the server. The server, which provides ''resources'' such as [[HTML]] files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a ''response'' message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.\n\nA web browser is an example of a ''[[user agent]]'' (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers ([[web crawler]]s), [[voice browser]]s, [[mobile app]]<nowiki/>s, and other [[software]] that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.\n\nHTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from [[web cache]] servers that deliver content on behalf of [[upstream server]]s to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, when possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP [[proxy server]]s at [[private network]] boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.\n\nHTTP is an [[application layer]] protocol designed within the framework of the [[Internet protocol suite]]. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable [[transport layer]] protocol,<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Overall Operation |section=1.4|title=RFC 2616  |page=12 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref> and [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is commonly used. However, HTTP can be adapted to use unreliable protocols such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), for example in [[HTTPU]] and [[Simple Service Discovery Protocol]] (SSDP).\n\n[[Web resource|HTTP resources]] are identified and located on the network by [[Uniform Resource Locator]]s (URLs), using the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URI's) schemes ''http'' and ''[[https]]''.  For example, including all optional components:\n<code><!-- apparently this works like <pre>, but wikilinks allowed \u2014 edit with caution -->\n             userinfo          [[Hostname|host]]        [[Port (computer networking)|port]]\n         \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 \u250c\u2534\u2510\n  <nowiki>http://john.doe:password@www.example.com:123/forum/questions/?tag=networking&order=newest#top</nowiki>\n  \u2514\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\u2514\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\u2514\u252c\u2500\u2518\n  [[Uniform Resource Identifier#Definition|scheme]]         authority                      path                  [[Query string|query]]             [[Fragment identifier|fragment]]\n</code>\nAs defined in RFC 3986, URIs are encoded as [[hyperlink]]s in [[HTML]] documents, so as to form interlinked [[hypertext]] documents.\n\nHTTP/1.1 is a revision of the original HTTP (HTTP/1.0). In HTTP/1.0 a separate [[Connection-oriented communication|connection]] to the same server is made for every resource request. HTTP/1.1 can reuse a connection multiple times to download images, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|stylesheets]], ''etc'' after the page has been delivered. HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tim Berners-Lee CP 2.jpg|thumb|[[Tim Berners-Lee]] ]]\n\nThe term [[hypertext]] was coined by [[Ted Nelson]] in 1965 in the [[Xanadu Project]], which was in turn inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s 1930s vision of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management \"[[memex]]\" system described in his 1945 essay \"[[As We May Think]]\". [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and his team at [[CERN]] are credited with inventing the original HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a text-based web browser. Berners-Lee first proposed the \"WorldWideWeb\" project in 1989\u2014now known as the [[World Wide Web]]. The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |title=HyperText Transfer Protocol |url=https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP.html |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> The response from the server was always an HTML page.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Original HTTP as defined in 1991 |url=https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=24 July 2010 |author=Tim Berners-Lee|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee }}</ref>\n\nThe first documented version of HTTP was '''[https://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html HTTP V0.9]''' (1991).

End-user adoption of the new browsers was rapid. In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet were HTTP 1.1 compliant. That same web hosting company reported that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were HTTP/1.1 compliant.<ref>{{cite web |work=Webcom.com Glossary entry |title=HTTP/1.1 |url=https://www.webcom.com/glossary/http1.1.shtml |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011121001051/https://www.webcom.com/glossary/http1.1.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-11-21 |accessdate=2009-05-29 }}</ref> The HTTP/1.1 standard as defined in {{IETF RFC|2068}} was officially released in January 1997.

In June 2014, the WG released an updated six-part specification obsoleting {{IETF RFC|2616}}:\n\n* {{IETF RFC|7230}}, ''HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing''\n* {{IETF RFC|7231}}, ''HTTP/1.1: Semantics and Content''\n* {{IETF RFC|7232}}, ''HTTP/1.1: Conditional Requests''\n* {{IETF RFC|7233}}, ''HTTP/1.1: Range Requests''\n* {{IETF RFC|7234}}, ''HTTP/1.1: Caching''\n* {{IETF RFC|7235}}, ''HTTP/1.1: Authentication''\n\n[[HTTP/2]] was published as {{IETF RFC|7540}} in May 2015.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!HTTP Version\n|-\n|1991\n|0.9\n|-\n|1996\n|1.0\n|-\n|1997\n|1.1\n|-\n|2015\n|[[HTTP/2|2.0]]\n|-\n|2018\n|[[HTTP/3|3.0]]\n|}\n\n==HTTP session==\nAn HTTP session is a sequence of network request-response transactions. An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) connection to a particular [[TCP and UDP port|port]] on a server (typically port 80, occasionally port 8080; see [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\", and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned.<ref name=\"ietf2616\" />\n\n===Persistent connections===\n{{Main|HTTP persistent connection}}\nIn HTTP/0.9 and 1.0, the connection is closed after a single request/response pair. In HTTP/1.1 a keep-alive-mechanism was introduced, where a connection could be reused for more than one request. Such ''persistent connections'' reduce request [[latency (engineering)|latency]] perceptibly, because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's [[slow-start]]-mechanism.\n\nVersion 1.1 of the protocol also made bandwidth optimization improvements to HTTP/1.0. For example, HTTP/1.1 introduced [[chunked transfer encoding]] to allow content on persistent connections to be streamed rather than buffered. [[HTTP pipelining]] further reduces lag time, allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. Another addition to the protocol was [[byte serving]], where a server transmits just the portion of a resource explicitly requested by a client.\n\n===HTTP session state===\nHTTP is a [[stateless protocol]]. A stateless protocol does not require the [[HTTP server]] to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, some [[web application]]s implement states or [[Session (computer science)|server side sessions]] using for instance [[HTTP cookie]]s or hidden [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s within [[Form (web)|web form]]s.\n\n==HTTP authentication==\nHTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as [[basic access authentication]] and [[digest access authentication]] which operate via  a challenge-response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.\n\nHTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge-response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.<ref name=\"ietf7235\">{{cite IETF |rfc=7235 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication |first1=Roy T. |last1=Fielding |first2=Julian F. |last2=Reschke |publisher=IETF |date=June 2014 |ref=ietf}}</ref>\n\n===Authentication realms===\nThe HTTP Authentication specification also provides an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.<ref name=\"ietf7235\" />\n\n==Message format==\n{{See also| List of HTTP header fields}}\n\nThe client sends '''requests''' to the server and the server sends '''responses'''.\n\n===Request message===\nThe request message consists of the following:\n\n* a request line (e.g., ''GET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1'', which requests a resource called {{code|/images/logo.png}} from the server)\n* [[HTTP request header field|request header fields]] (e.g., ''Accept-Language: en'')\n* an empty line\n* an optional [[HTTP message body|message body]]\n\nThe request line and other header fields must each end with <CR><LF> (that is, a [[carriage return]] character followed by a [[line feed]] character).

The [[HTTP request|request]] message, [[HTTP response|response]] header section, and response body are highlighted.]]\nHTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as ''verbs'', but nowhere in the specification does it mention ''verb'', nor is OPTIONS or HEAD a verb) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=1945 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol \u2013 HTTP/1.0 |first1=Tim |last1=Berners-Lee |first2=Roy T. |last2=Fielding |first3=Henrik Frystyk |last3=Nielsen |publisher=IETF |sectionname=Method Definitions |section=8 |pages=30\u201332}}</ref> defined the GET, HEAD and POST methods and the HTTP/1.1 specification<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Method Definitions |section=9 |title=RFC 2616|pages=51\u201357 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref> added five new methods: OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT. By being specified in these documents, their semantics are well-known and can be depended on. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and [[idempotence|non-idempotent]] method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined and this allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, [[WebDAV]] defined 7 new methods and {{IETF RFC|5789}} specified the [[Patch verb|PATCH]] method.\n\nMethod names are case sensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1 |title=RFC-7210 section 3.1.1 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.1 |title=RFC-7231 section 4.1 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-06-26}}</ref>  This is in contrast to HTTP header field names which are case-insensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 |title=RFC-7230 section 3.2 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\n;GET: The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only [[Data retrieval|retrieve data]] and should have no other effect.

This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.\n;POST: The [[POST (HTTP)|POST method]] requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the [[web resource]] identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a [[Form (HTML)|web form]] to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=POST |section=9.5|title=RFC 2616 |page=54 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n;PUT:The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]].

In other words, they should not have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], beyond relatively harmless effects such as [[Server log|logging]], web caching, the serving of [[web banner|banner advertisements]] or incrementing a [[web counter]]. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application's state should therefore be considered safe. However, this is not mandated by the standard, and it is explicitly acknowledged that it cannot be guaranteed.\n\nBy contrast, methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as [[eCommerce|financial transactions]] or transmission of [[email]]. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming [[Internet bot|web robots]] or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\n\nDespite the prescribed safety of ''GET'' requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for [[web caching]], [[search engines]] and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as ''<nowiki>http://example.com/article/1234/delete</nowiki>'', which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using ''GET'', would simply delete the article.<ref name=\"oreilly-get-rails\">{{cite book |last=Ediger |first=Brad |date=2007-12-21 |title=Advanced Rails: Building Industrial-Strength Web Apps in Record Time |url=https://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510329.do |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |page=188 |isbn= 978-0596519728 |quote=A common mistake is to use GET for an action that updates a resource. [...] This problem came into the Rails public eye in 2005, when the Google Web Accelerator was released.}}</ref>\n\nOne example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived [[Google Web Accelerator]] [[Beta test|beta]], which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted ''en masse''. The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/what_have_we_le.html |title=What Have We Learned From the Google Web Accelerator? |last=Cantrell |first=Christian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819161233/http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/what_have_we_le.html |archive-date=2017-08-19 |date=2005-06-01 |website=Adobe Blogs |publisher=Adobe |access-date=2018-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"oreilly-get-rails\" />\n\n=====Idempotent methods and web applications=====\nMethods PUT and DELETE are defined to be [[idempotent#Computer science meaning|idempotent]], meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request. Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a [[stateless protocol]].<ref name=\"ietf2616\" />\n\nIn contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as [[ecommerce|financial transactions]]). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While [[web browser]]s may show [[alert dialog box]]es to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\n\nNote that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a [[user agent]] assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\n\n=====Security=====\nThe TRACE method can be used as part of a class of attacks known as [[cross-site tracing]]; for that reason, common security advice is for it to be disabled in the server configuration.<ref name=\"OWASP-XST\">{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_Site_Tracing |title=Cross Site Tracing |publisher=[[OWASP]] |accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref> Microsoft [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] supports a proprietary \"TRACK\" method, which behaves similarly, and which is likewise recommended to be disabled.<ref name=\"OWASP-XST\" />\n\n=====Summary table=====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

The way the [[user agent]] handles the response depends primarily on the code, and secondarily on the other [[HTTP response header field|response header fields]]. Custom status codes can be used, for if the user agent encounters a code it does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Status-Line |section=6.1|title=RFC 2616  |page=39 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n\nThe standard ''reason phrases'' are only recommendations, and can be replaced with \"local equivalents\" at the [[web developer]]'s discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the ''reason phrase'' to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the ''reason phrase'', though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and ''reason phrases'' are human-readable. HTTP status code is primarily divided into five groups for better explanation of request and responses between client and server as named:\n\n* Informational <code>1XX</code>\n* Successful <code>2XX</code>\n* Redirection <code>3XX</code>\n* Client Error <code>4XX</code>\n* Server Error <code>5XX</code>\n\n==Encrypted connections==\nThe most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS.<ref>{{cite book |last=Canavan |first=John |title=Fundamentals of Networking Security |year=2001 |publisher=Artech House |location=Norwood, MA |isbn=9781580531764 |pages=82\u201383}}</ref> Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: [[Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol]], and using the [[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header]] to specify an upgrade to TLS.

The \"Host\" field distinguishes between various [[Domain Name System|DNS]] names sharing a single [[IP address]], allowing name-based [[virtual hosting]].

''Content-Type'' specifies the [[Internet media type]] of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, while ''Content-Length'' indicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 [[webserver]] publishes its ability to respond to requests for certain byte ranges of the document by setting the field ''Accept-Ranges: bytes''. This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions<ref>{{cite IETF |draft=draft-ietf-http-range-retrieval-00 |title=Byte Range Retrieval Extension to HTTP |first1=Ari |last1=Luotonen |first2=John |last2=Franks |publisher=IETF |date=February 22, 1996}}</ref> of a resource sent by the server, which is called [[byte serving]]. When ''Connection: close'' is sent, it means that the [[web server]] will close the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection immediately after the transfer of this response.\n\nMost of the header lines are optional. When ''Content-Length'' is missing the length is determined in other ways. Chunked transfer encoding uses a chunk size of 0 to mark the end of the content. ''Identity'' encoding without ''Content-Length'' reads content until the socket is closed.\n\nA ''Content-Encoding'' like ''[[gzip]]'' can be used to compress the transmitted data.\n\n==Similar protocols==\n\n* The [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] is a content delivery protocol that was displaced by HTTP in the early 1990s.\n* The [[SPDY]] protocol is an alternative to HTTP developed at [[Google]], superseded by [[HTTP/2]].\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{HTTP}}\n\n* [[Comparison of file transfer protocols]]\n* [[Constrained Application Protocol]] \u2013 a semantically similar protocol to HTTP but used UDP or UDP-like messages targeted for devices with limited processing capability; re-uses HTTP and other internet concepts like [[Internet media type]] and web linking (<nowiki>RFC 5988</nowiki>)<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=5988 |title=Web Linking |first1=Mark |last1=Nottingham |publisher=IETF |date=October 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Content negotiation]]\n* [[Curl-loader]] \u2013 HTTP/S loading and testing open-source software\n* [[Digest access authentication]]\n* [[Fiddler (software)]]\n* [[HTTP compression]]\n* [[HTTP/2]] \u2013 developed by the IETF's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (httpbis) working group<ref>{{cite web |url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/charter/ |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol Bis (httpbis) \u2013 Charter |publisher=IETF |year=2012}}</ref>\n* HTTP-MPLEX \u2013 A backwards compatible enhancement to HTTP to improve page and web object retrieval time in congested networks proposed by Robert Mattson\n* [[List of HTTP header fields]]\n* [[List of HTTP status codes]]\n* [[Representational state transfer]] (REST)\n* [[Variant object]]\n* [[Web cache]]\n* [[WebSocket]]\n* [[Wireshark]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}ii\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hypertext Transfer Protocol}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/Protocols/History.html |title=Change History for HTTP |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}} A detailed technical history of HTTP.\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/Protocols/DesignIssues.html |title=Design Issues for HTTP |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}} Design Issues by Berners-Lee when he was designing the protocol.\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/Protocols/Classic.html |title=Classic HTTP Documents |publisher=W3.org |date=1998-05-14 |accessdate=2010-08-01}} list of other classic documents recounting the early protocol history\n* [https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html HTTP 0.9 \u2013 As Implemented in 1991]\n* [https://http2.co/ HTTP/2 Website Online Tester]\n\n{{Web browsers|fsp}}\n{{Semantic Web}}\n{{URI scheme}}\n{{Web interfaces}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hypertext Transfer Protocol| ]]\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Internet protocols]]\n[[Category:Network protocols]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1991]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems}}\n{{pp-pc1}} \n{{Infobox protocol\n| image       = HTTP logo.svg\n| standard    = {{IETF RFC|7231}}\n| developer   = initially [[CERN]]; [[IETF]], [[W3C]]\n| introdate   = {{Start date and age|1991|df=yes}}\n| newer       = \n}}\n{{HTTP}}\n{{IPstack}}\n\nThe '''Hypertext Transfer Protocol''' ('''HTTP''') is an [[application protocol]] for distributed, collaborative, [[hypermedia]] information systems.<ref name=\"ietf2616\">{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol \u2013 HTTP/1.1 |first1=Roy T. |last1=Fielding |first2=James |last2=Gettys |first3=Jeffrey C. |last3=Mogul |first4=Henrik Frystyk |last4=Nielsen |first5=Larry |last5=Masinter |first6=Paul J. |last6=Leach |first7=Tim |last7=Berners-Lee |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |date=June 1999 |ref=ietf}}</ref> HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the [[World Wide Web]], where [[hypertext]] documents include [[hyperlink]]s to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.\n\nDevelopment of HTTP was initiated by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] in 1989.

A [[web browser]], for example, may be the ''client'' and an application running on a computer [[Host (network)|hosting]] a [[website]] may be the ''server''. The client submits an HTTP ''request'' message to the server. The server, which provides ''resources'' such as [[HTML]] files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a ''response'' message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.\n\nA web browser is an example of a ''[[user agent]]'' (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers ([[web crawler]]s), [[voice browser]]s, [[mobile app]]<nowiki/>s, and other [[software]] that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.\n\nHTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from [[web cache]] servers that deliver content on behalf of [[upstream server]]s to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, when possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP [[proxy server]]s at [[private network]] boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.\n\nHTTP is an [[application layer]] protocol designed within the framework of the [[Internet protocol suite]]. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable [[transport layer]] protocol,<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Overall Operation |section=1.4|title=RFC 2616  |page=12 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref> and [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is commonly used. However, HTTP can be adapted to use unreliable protocols such as the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), for example in [[HTTPU]] and [[Simple Service Discovery Protocol]] (SSDP).\n\n[[Web resource|HTTP resources]] are identified and located on the network by [[Uniform Resource Locator]]s (URLs), using the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URI's) schemes ''http'' and ''[[https]]''.

In HTTP/1.0 a separate [[Connection-oriented communication|connection]] to the same server is made for every resource request. HTTP/1.1 can reuse a connection multiple times to download images, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|stylesheets]], ''etc'' after the page has been delivered.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] and his team at [[CERN]] are credited with inventing the original HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a text-based web browser. Berners-Lee first proposed the \"WorldWideWeb\" project in 1989\u2014now known as the [[World Wide Web]]. The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |title=HyperText Transfer Protocol |url=https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP.html |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> The response from the server was always an HTML page.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Original HTTP as defined in 1991 |url=https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |accessdate=24 July 2010 |author=Tim Berners-Lee|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee }}</ref>\n\nThe first documented version of HTTP was '''[https://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html HTTP V0.9]''' (1991).

An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) connection to a particular [[TCP and UDP port|port]] on a server (typically port 80, occasionally port 8080; see [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers]]). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\", and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned.<ref name=\"ietf2616\" />\n\n===Persistent connections===\n{{Main|HTTP persistent connection}}\nIn HTTP/0.9 and 1.0, the connection is closed after a single request/response pair. In HTTP/1.1 a keep-alive-mechanism was introduced, where a connection could be reused for more than one request. Such ''persistent connections'' reduce request [[latency (engineering)|latency]] perceptibly, because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's [[slow-start]]-mechanism.\n\nVersion 1.1 of the protocol also made bandwidth optimization improvements to HTTP/1.0. For example, HTTP/1.1 introduced [[chunked transfer encoding]] to allow content on persistent connections to be streamed rather than buffered. [[HTTP pipelining]] further reduces lag time, allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response. Another addition to the protocol was [[byte serving]], where a server transmits just the portion of a resource explicitly requested by a client.\n\n===HTTP session state===\nHTTP is a [[stateless protocol]]. A stateless protocol does not require the [[HTTP server]] to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, some [[web application]]s implement states or [[Session (computer science)|server side sessions]] using for instance [[HTTP cookie]]s or hidden [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s within [[Form (web)|web form]]s.\n\n==HTTP authentication==\nHTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as [[basic access authentication]] and [[digest access authentication]] which operate via  a challenge-response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.\n\nHTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge-response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.<ref name=\"ietf7235\">{{cite IETF |rfc=7235 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication |first1=Roy T. |last1=Fielding |first2=Julian F. |last2=Reschke |publisher=IETF |date=June 2014 |ref=ietf}}</ref>\n\n===Authentication realms===\nThe HTTP Authentication specification also provides an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.<ref name=\"ietf7235\" />\n\n==Message format==\n{{See also| List of HTTP header fields}}\n\nThe client sends '''requests''' to the server and the server sends '''responses'''.\n\n===Request message===\nThe request message consists of the following:\n\n* a request line (e.g., ''GET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1'', which requests a resource called {{code|/images/logo.png}} from the server)\n* [[HTTP request header field|request header fields]] (e.g., ''Accept-Language: en'')\n* an empty line\n* an optional [[HTTP message body|message body]]\n\nThe request line and other header fields must each end with <CR><LF> (that is, a [[carriage return]] character followed by a [[line feed]] character). The empty line must consist of only <CR><LF> and no other [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]].<ref name=\"ietf2616sec4\">{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=HTTP Message |section=4 |page=31|title=RFC 2616|idanchor=ietf}}</ref> In the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all header fields except ''Host'' are optional.\n\nA request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in {{IETF RFC|1945}}.<ref name=\"apacheweek_com-http11\">{{cite web |title=Apache Week.

The [[HTTP request|request]] message, [[HTTP response|response]] header section, and response body are highlighted.]]\nHTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as ''verbs'', but nowhere in the specification does it mention ''verb'', nor is OPTIONS or HEAD a verb) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=1945 |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol \u2013 HTTP/1.0 |first1=Tim |last1=Berners-Lee |first2=Roy T. |last2=Fielding |first3=Henrik Frystyk |last3=Nielsen |publisher=IETF |sectionname=Method Definitions |section=8 |pages=30\u201332}}</ref> defined the GET, HEAD and POST methods and the HTTP/1.1 specification<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Method Definitions |section=9 |title=RFC 2616|pages=51\u201357 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref> added five new methods: OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT. By being specified in these documents, their semantics are well-known and can be depended on. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and [[idempotence|non-idempotent]] method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined and this allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, [[WebDAV]] defined 7 new methods and {{IETF RFC|5789}} specified the [[Patch verb|PATCH]] method.\n\nMethod names are case sensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1 |title=RFC-7210 section 3.1.1 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.1 |title=RFC-7231 section 4.1 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-06-26}}</ref>  This is in contrast to HTTP header field names which are case-insensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 |title=RFC-7230 section 3.2 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\n;GET: The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only [[Data retrieval|retrieve data]] and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)<ref name=\"ietf2616\" /> The [[W3C]] has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, \"[[Web application]] design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Jacobs |first=Ian |title=URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST |url=https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html#checklist |work=Technical Architecture Group finding |publisher=W3C |accessdate=26 September 2010 |year=2004}}</ref> See [[#Safe methods|safe methods]] below.\n;HEAD: The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.\n;POST: The [[POST (HTTP)|POST method]] requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the [[web resource]] identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a [[Form (HTML)|web form]] to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=POST |section=9.5|title=RFC 2616 |page=54 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n;PUT:The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=PUT |section=9.6|title=RFC 2616 |page=55 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n;DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.\n;TRACE: The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.\n;OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified [[URL]]. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.\n;CONNECT:<ref name=\"rfc2616.9.9\">{{cite IETF |title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol \u2013 HTTP/1.1 |rfc=2616 |sectionname=CONNECT |section=9.9 |page=57 |date=June 1999 |publisher=IETF |accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref> The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent [[tunneling protocol|TCP/IP tunnel]], usually to facilitate [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted [[HTTP proxy]].<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2817 |title=Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1 |first1=Rohit |last1=Khare |first2=Scott |last2=Lawrence |date=May 2000 |publisher=IETF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/150227 |title=Vulnerability Note VU#150227: HTTP proxy default configurations allow arbitrary TCP connections |accessdate=2007-05-10 |date=2002-05-17 |publisher=[[CERT Coordination Center|US-CERT]]}}</ref> See [[HTTP tunnel#HTTP CONNECT method|HTTP CONNECT method]].\n;PATCH: The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=5789 |title=PATCH Method for HTTP |first1=Lisa |last1=Dusseault |first2=James M. |last2=Snell |date=March 2010 |publisher=IETF}}</ref>\nAll general-purpose HTTP servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods, and all other methods are considered optional by the specification.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Method |section=5.1.1|title=RFC 2616 |page=36 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n\n=====Safe methods=====\nSome of the  methods (for example, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE) are, by convention, defined as ''safe'', which means they are [[Command\u2013query separation|intended only for information retrieval]] and should not change the state of the server. In other words, they should not have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], beyond relatively harmless effects such as [[Server log|logging]], web caching, the serving of [[web banner|banner advertisements]] or incrementing a [[web counter]]. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application's state should therefore be considered safe. However, this is not mandated by the standard, and it is explicitly acknowledged that it cannot be guaranteed.\n\nBy contrast, methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as [[eCommerce|financial transactions]] or transmission of [[email]]. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming [[Internet bot|web robots]] or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\n\nDespite the prescribed safety of ''GET'' requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for [[web caching]], [[search engines]] and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as ''<nowiki>http://example.com/article/1234/delete</nowiki>'', which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using ''GET'', would simply delete the article.<ref name=\"oreilly-get-rails\">{{cite book |last=Ediger |first=Brad |date=2007-12-21 |title=Advanced Rails: Building Industrial-Strength Web Apps in Record Time |url=https://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596510329.do |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |page=188 |isbn= 978-0596519728 |quote=A common mistake is to use GET for an action that updates a resource. [...] This problem came into the Rails public eye in 2005, when the Google Web Accelerator was released.}}</ref>\n\nOne example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived [[Google Web Accelerator]] [[Beta test|beta]], which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted ''en masse''. The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/what_have_we_le.html |title=What Have We Learned From the Google Web Accelerator? |last=Cantrell |first=Christian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819161233/http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2005/06/what_have_we_le.html |archive-date=2017-08-19 |date=2005-06-01 |website=Adobe Blogs |publisher=Adobe |access-date=2018-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"oreilly-get-rails\" />\n\n=====Idempotent methods and web applications=====\nMethods PUT and DELETE are defined to be [[idempotent#Computer science meaning|idempotent]], meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request. Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a [[stateless protocol]].<ref name=\"ietf2616\" />\n\nIn contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as [[ecommerce|financial transactions]]). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While [[web browser]]s may show [[alert dialog box]]es to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\n\nNote that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a [[user agent]] assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\n\n=====Security=====\nThe TRACE method can be used as part of a class of attacks known as [[cross-site tracing]]; for that reason, common security advice is for it to be disabled in the server configuration.<ref name=\"OWASP-XST\">{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_Site_Tracing |title=Cross Site Tracing |publisher=[[OWASP]] |accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref> Microsoft [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] supports a proprietary \"TRACK\" method, which behaves similarly, and which is likewise recommended to be disabled.<ref name=\"OWASP-XST\" />\n\n=====Summary table=====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n!

The way the [[user agent]] handles the response depends primarily on the code, and secondarily on the other [[HTTP response header field|response header fields]]. Custom status codes can be used, for if the user agent encounters a code it does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=2616 |sectionname=Status-Line |section=6.1|title=RFC 2616  |page=39 |idanchor=ietf}}</ref>\n\nThe standard ''reason phrases'' are only recommendations, and can be replaced with \"local equivalents\" at the [[web developer]]'s discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the ''reason phrase'' to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the ''reason phrase'', though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and ''reason phrases'' are human-readable. HTTP status code is primarily divided into five groups for better explanation of request and responses between client and server as named:\n\n* Informational <code>1XX</code>\n* Successful <code>2XX</code>\n* Redirection <code>3XX</code>\n* Client Error <code>4XX</code>\n* Server Error <code>5XX</code>\n\n==Encrypted connections==\nThe most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS.<ref>{{cite book |last=Canavan |first=John |title=Fundamentals of Networking Security |year=2001 |publisher=Artech House |location=Norwood, MA |isbn=9781580531764 |pages=82\u201383}}</ref> Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: [[Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol]], and using the [[HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header]] to specify an upgrade to TLS.

The \"Host\" field distinguishes between various [[Domain Name System|DNS]] names sharing a single [[IP address]], allowing name-based [[virtual hosting]].

''Content-Type'' specifies the [[Internet media type]] of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, while ''Content-Length'' indicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 [[webserver]] publishes its ability to respond to requests for certain byte ranges of the document by setting the field ''Accept-Ranges: bytes''. This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions<ref>{{cite IETF |draft=draft-ietf-http-range-retrieval-00 |title=Byte Range Retrieval Extension to HTTP |first1=Ari |last1=Luotonen |first2=John |last2=Franks |publisher=IETF |date=February 22, 1996}}</ref> of a resource sent by the server, which is called [[byte serving]]. When ''Connection: close'' is sent, it means that the [[web server]] will close the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connection immediately after the transfer of this response.\n\nMost of the header lines are optional.

As with all other Queen performances since 1997, longstanding bassist [[John Deacon]] has declined to participate in the project due to his retirement. This is the first long-term collaboration of Queen since the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] project ended in 2009. Like the previous project, it was made clear that Lambert would not be replacing Queen frontman [[Freddie Mercury]], but rather that he would be featured with the band's active members. The collaboration originated when May and Taylor appeared on ''[[American Idol (season 8)|American Idol]]'' in 2009 when Lambert was a contestant. They began performing occasionally in 2011, conducted a short [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2012|European tour]] in 2012, and in 2014 announced a world tour, the [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2014\u20132015]] with dates in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and South America. In the summer of 2016, the group performed several dates as part of a festival tour in Europe and several dates in Asia. The next year, the group announced a second worldwide tour scheduled for 2017 and 2018 and later announced a short United Kingdom tour for 2020.\n\nJoining May, Taylor and Lambert are long-time Queen touring keyboardist [[Spike Edney]], bassist Neil Fairclough and percussionist Tyler Warren. Although there are currently no plans to release a studio album with this lineup, May and Taylor have stated that there is a possibility of the group recording original material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/queen-recording-adam-lambert/|title=Queen Hint at Recording New Material with Adam Lambert|work=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nQueen and Lambert first performed together in 2009 when Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared as guests on the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season of ''American Idol'']] on which Lambert was a contestant.

As with all other Queen performances since 1997, longstanding bassist [[John Deacon]] has declined to participate in the project due to his retirement. This is the first long-term collaboration of Queen since the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] project ended in 2009. Like the previous project, it was made clear that Lambert would not be replacing Queen frontman [[Freddie Mercury]], but rather that he would be featured with the band's active members. The collaboration originated when May and Taylor appeared on ''[[American Idol (season 8)|American Idol]]'' in 2009 when Lambert was a contestant. They began performing occasionally in 2011, conducted a short [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2012|European tour]] in 2012, and in 2014 announced a world tour, the [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2014\u20132015]] with dates in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and South America. In the summer of 2016, the group performed several dates as part of a festival tour in Europe and several dates in Asia. The next year, the group announced a second worldwide tour scheduled for 2017 and 2018 and later announced a short United Kingdom tour for 2020.\n\nJoining May, Taylor and Lambert are long-time Queen touring keyboardist [[Spike Edney]], bassist Neil Fairclough and percussionist Tyler Warren. Although there are currently no plans to release a studio album with this lineup, May and Taylor have stated that there is a possibility of the group recording original material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/queen-recording-adam-lambert/|title=Queen Hint at Recording New Material with Adam Lambert|work=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nQueen and Lambert first performed together in 2009 when Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared as guests on the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season of ''American Idol'']] on which Lambert was a contestant.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

The tremolo is interesting in that the arm's made from an old bicycle saddle bag carrier, the knob at the end's off a knitting needle and the springs are valve springs from an old motorbike.<ref>Mick St. Michael (1992). ''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], on the basis that their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\", \"Chinese Torture\"), [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"), [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n*July 1973&nbsp;\u2013 May 1974: [[Fender Stratocaster]] CBS era (thought to be a 1972)\n*October 1974&nbsp;\u2013 May 1975: [[Gibson Les Paul]] Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.\n*November 1975&nbsp;\u2013 May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.\n*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for \"'39\".\n*January 1977&nbsp;\u2013 August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (\"'39\", \"Love of My Life\", \"Dreamer's Ball\").\n*November 1979&nbsp;\u2013 June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), [[Fender Telecaster]] (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).\n*July&nbsp;\u2013 November 1982: Added a [[Gibson Flying V]] as second back-up. On 9 August 1982 May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying&nbsp;V became the only spare.\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor's Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.\n*July 1985&nbsp;\u2013 August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same.\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings.

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976) and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]]. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a [[PhD]]<ref name=mayphd/> degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from [[interplanetary dust]] and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System.

As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[IRAS]] satellite.

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

The tremolo is interesting in that the arm's made from an old bicycle saddle bag carrier, the knob at the end's off a knitting needle and the springs are valve springs from an old motorbike.<ref>Mick St. Michael (1992). ''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], on the basis that their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\", \"Chinese Torture\"), [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"), [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"), slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"), [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"), tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\") and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On stage, May used to carry at least one back-up guitar (in case he broke a string) and occasionally would use others for certain songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company which makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n*July 1973&nbsp;\u2013 May 1974: [[Fender Stratocaster]] CBS era (thought to be a 1972)\n*October 1974&nbsp;\u2013 May 1975: [[Gibson Les Paul]] Deluxe, and the Stratocaster from the previous tour.\n*November 1975&nbsp;\u2013 May 1976: Same two guitars as before, plus a natural finish John Birch replica of the Red Special.\n*September 1976: Same three as before, plus a Martin D-18 acoustic for \"'39\".\n*January 1977&nbsp;\u2013 August 1979: Just the Birch replica plus an Ovation Pacemaker 12-string acoustic on some numbers (\"'39\", \"Love of My Life\", \"Dreamer's Ball\").\n*November 1979&nbsp;\u2013 June 1982: Birch replica (back-up), [[Fender Telecaster]] (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" 2nd verse, middle-eight and solo), Ovation (acoustic numbers).\n*July&nbsp;\u2013 November 1982: Added a [[Gibson Flying V]] as second back-up. On 9 August 1982 May smashed the Birch guitar, so the Flying&nbsp;V became the only spare.\n*August&nbsp;\u2013 October 1984: The Flying V became a second back-up again as his main spare was the Guild replica. He also used Roger Taylor's Gibson Chet-Atkins Classical Electric.\n*July 1985&nbsp;\u2013 August 1986: Gibson Flying V no longer used. The rest remained the same.\n*In 2012 he received a double-neck replica of the Red Special with the second neck having 12-strings.

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976) and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, flanger and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would occasionally step in (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\" and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March\", \"[[Let Me Live]]\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used [[Yamaha DX7]] synths for the opening sequence of \"[[One Vision]]\" and the backgrounds of \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" (also on stage), \"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]\" and [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|\"The Show Must Go On\"]].\n\nThe first instrument May learned to play was the [[Banjo uke|banjolele]]. He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"The Prophet's Song\"]].\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]]. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a [[PhD]]<ref name=mayphd/> degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from [[interplanetary dust]] and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System.

As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[IRAS]] satellite.

It is located {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast of the [[Bay of Bengal]], and {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Chennai]]. Sirkazhi was a part of [[Thanjavur district]] until 1991 and has later been part of [[Nagapattinam district]] until 2020. The town covers an area of {{convert|13.21|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and in 2011 had a population of 34,927. It is administered by a [[Local administration in Tamil Nadu#Urban Local Bodies|second grade municipality]].{{Ref|a| '''a'''}} Sirkazhi is part of the [[Cauvery Delta|Cauvery delta region]] and agriculture is the major occupation. Roads are the main means of transportation; the town has {{convert|51.47|km|mi|abbr=on}} of district roads, including a national highway.\n\nThe town is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled by the [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Later Pandyas]], the [[Vijayanagar Empire]], the [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom|Marathas]] and the [[British Raj|British]].

The Saiva saint [[Sambandar|Tirugnanasambandar]], foremost of the Saiva Nayanars, was born here in the seventh century. The history of the town is centred on the [[Sattainathar Temple, Sirkazhi|Sattainathar Temple]], which is dedicated to Hindu god [[Shiva]].\n\n==Etymology and origin==\n[[File:Thirukkadaiyur Gopuram Appar.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A temple relief depicting Appar bearing Sambandar's palanquin|alt=A sculpture depicting a person is a palanquin carried by others.]] In ancient times, this town had twelve different names, including Brahmapuram, Venupuram, Thonipuram, Kazhumalam, Pugali, Sirkazhiswaram and Shri Kali.{{sfn|City Corporate cum Business Plan for Sirkazhi Municipality|2009}}{{sfn|Pillai|1904|p=91}} According to Hindu legend, during one of the biggest deluges that submerged the planet earth, Hindu god [[Shiva]] is said to have carried the [[Kal\u0101|64 arts]] on a raft (called ''Thoni'' in Tamil). The presiding deity in the temple, Shiva, is thus called \"Thoniappar\" (the one who carried the raft) and the region is called \"Thonipuram\".{{sfn|Ayyar|1991| p=244}}{{sfn|Ayyar|1991| p=42}}{{sfn|V.K.|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Pillai|1904|p=91}} The Hindu god [[Brahma]] is believed to have worshiped Shiva here, giving the name \"Bhramapureeswarar\" (the one worshipped by Brahma) and so the region is also referred as \"Bhramapureeswaram\".{{sfn|Director of Census operations|1991|p=55}}{{sfn|Pillai|1904|p=91}} Shiva is believed to have quelled the arrogance of Hindu god [[Vishnu]], after showing his dominance over the three worlds and hence got the name \"Sattainathar\" here. The town is thus called \"Sattainathapuram\", which in modern times, is a suburb within Sirkazhi. The town was known as \"Kalumalam\" during the early Chola period.{{sfn|Aiyangar|1911|p=92}} [[Sambandar|Thirugnanasambandar]], the seventh century Saiva [[nayanars|nayanar]], as an infant is believed to have been fed with the milk of wisdom by the divine mother [[Parvati]] on the banks of the temple tank. The child Sambandar started singing the anthology of ''[[Tevaram]]'' hymns from then on, commencing with \"Todudaiya Seviyan\". Sambandar refers the town as \"Kazhi\" in his verses.{{sfn|Ayyar|1991| p=244}}{{sfn|Ayyar|1991| p=42}}{{sfn|V.K.|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Pillai|1904|p=91}} It was called Shiyali during [[British Raj|British rule]], and after [[India's independence|Independence]], it was renamed \"Sirkazhi\".{{sfn|City Corporate cum Business Plan for Sirkazhi Municipality|2009}}\n\n==History==\nThe earliest mention of Sirkazhi is found in the history of the Chola king [[Kocengannan]] from the [[Sangam Age]] (3rd century BCE to 4th century CE), who is believed to have won a bloody battle here.{{sfn|Aiyangar|1911|p=96}} During the 7th\u20138th century, there were widespread disputes between the Hindu sects of [[Saivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]]. Tirugnanasambandar and Thirumangai Azhwar, belonging to Saivism and Vaishnavism, respectively, and both natives of Sirkazhi, had disputes over their religious compositions and theologies during the period.{{sfn|Aiyangar|1911|p=413}} The Chola Kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries, from 850 to 1280, and were temple patrons.
