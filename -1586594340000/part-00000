Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.<ref name=carol/> Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism \u2013 dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).<ref name=ttgov/><ref name=apara>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57\u201359</ref>\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation, and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.<ref name=parasarthy>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91\u201392, 160\u2013162</ref> The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows.

The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The [[samudra manthan]] commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. [[Vishnu]] incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning.

According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the ''Devas''(god) and ''Asuras''(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk([[Ksheera Sagara]]). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow [[Kamadhenu]], [[Varuni]], [[Parijat]] tree, [[Apsaras]], [[Chandra]](the moon) and [[Dhanvantari]] with [[Amrita]](nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu.

{"title_page": "Conversations in Bloomsbury", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:ConversationsInBloomsbury.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. Wildwood House]]\n'''''Conversations in Bloomsbury''''' is a 1981 [[memoir]] that depicts writer [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s life in London during the heyday of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], and his relationships with the group's members. It provides a rare insight into the intimate workings of the English modernist movement, portraying such prominent figures as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Anand challenges the cultural narrative that many have received about these literary figures.\n\n== Visions of the Bloomsbury Group ==\n\nAnand leaves a snapshot of the Bloomsbury Group for posterity, focalizing the individuals within the group through issues of colonial prejudice. His revelations, written decades after his experiences, and retrospectively framed by a postcolonial perspective, often give uncomfortable perspectives on the racist and casually jingoistic attitudes of a seemingly liberal movement. Commentary often engages with the significance of the British 'civilising' mission. Comments include T.S. Eliot's remark 'I wish that Indians would tone down their politics and renew their culture'.<ref>Mulk Raj Anand, ''Conversations in Bloomsbury'' (Delhi: Oxford UP, 1995) 150.</ref> Retrospectively, it is possible to point out shortcomings of these writers, inviting a re-examination of their work.\n\nThe text gives a highly subjective reading of the Bloomsbury Group, one which is elevated from a biographical recording to a complex and amusing satire of intellectual prejudice, by virtue of Anand's position on the margins of the group. The form of the text allows Anand to set up an ironic distance between the voices of the Bloomsbury Group and the silent undercurrents of their conversations. The prejudices and biases of the group become glaringly obvious because Anand guides the reader to see the dismissal of colonial cruelties that the insular nature of the group prevents them from seeing themselves.\n\nAnand expresses particular disillusion with the group's ignorance of other cultures, arguing that this is an obstacle to the modernist endeavour. He is also critical of their disengagement with both national and international politics, particularly on the issue of Indian independence.\n\n== Genre and Form ==\n\nPublished in 1981, the text's frame of reference leads the reader to question the veracity of Anand's account. Most of the people he comes across have extensive bodies of work, and the reader cannot be sure where the line is between the people he met in 1920s London and the perceived personas of these writers years later. Described by Anand in the dedication to the 1981 edition as 'gossip' and as 'reminiscences' by [[Saros Cowasjee]] (Introduction), ''Conversations'' can be classified as [[life writing]]. It resembles a memoir, with the 'snapshot' style of the narrative implying that there is an element of entertainment to its construction. The text shows stylistic influences as wide as [[melodrama]] and [[travel writing]]. Anand shows the personalities of historical figures outside of their literary context. The text also shows a self-conscious understanding of its author's own intellectual maturation.\n\nUltimately, ''Conversations in Bloomsbury'' takes the form of the memoir rather than an autobiography; the episodic conversations are structured around Anand's personal interest rather than any particular narrative. This makes his recollections of his relationships deeply personal and thereby potentially unreliable. Although the conversations may not be recorded verbatim, he gives a sense of the personalities and opinions of each figure. The very literary nature of his encounters and conversations are sometimes strained and point towards a certain degree of implausibility. For example, in chapter eighteen, Anand asks \"is it about India?\" as his first question of a new novel. He requires an alert reader to realize the ironies embedded within his writing which echoes a modernist approach to writing. The conversations in structure also are never truly resolved; this echoes the colonial and subsequently post-colonial issues that trouble Anand throughout his narrative. Martha Jane Nadell in \"Modernism and Race\" points towards the traditional tension between race and modernism as modernism, though apparently progressive, ignored issues of race. Conversations in Bloomsbury realises this tension through his unfinished conversations, inability to express himself and follow strict codes of English conduct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture|last=Bradshaw|first=David|publisher=Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nAs a text that blurs the lines between memoir, fiction, and autobiography, Conversations enacts numerous textual aspirations. It is at once a portrait of an Indian ingenue and autodidact making his way, problematically, at times, into the inner circle of the Bloomsbury group; a biographical snapshot of the group's venerated literary figures; and the ways in which Anand attempts to assert himself, and by extension, India and Indian culture, into the conversations surrounding empire and colonialism in the progressive circle of the Bloomsbury group.\n\nAnand demonstrates how the canonical modernists' discussions and texts, despite the progressive views that they represent, nevertheless demonstrate their heritage of an imperial discourse. He shows that \"modernism sought energies in the strangeness and distance of the other... in the terms that seemed to fit into its essentially Eurocentric framework\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Laura|title=Geomodernisms: Race, Modernism and Modernity|date=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=49}}</ref> The conversations\u2014inaccessible as they are\u2014are way of situating Indian culture at the same level as English culture. By depicting multiple conversations between himself and canonical British authors such as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, Anand equates himself as one of the Bloomsbury group. Although this could be seen as a mere tool of self-promotion, it also makes the point that the Indian culture Anand comes from is just as important as British culture.\n\n== Historical disparities ==\nThe historical gap between the writing, subsequent publication and the experiences depicted in Conversations in Bloomsbury gives Anand license to imagine the past and the Bloomsbury Group. However, almost contradictorily Anand is legitimised by the undeniable fact that he was there. This contradiction is allowed for by the fact that Conversations is a memoir.\n\nThe substantial distance between experience and publication allows for an extremely critical perspective, contrary to Anna Snaith's perspective of the bloomsbury group as representing \"a Britishness to do with bohemian modernity and intellectual freedoms\",<ref>{{Cite journal|title='The Hogarth Press and Networks of Anti-Colonialism'|journal=Anna Snaith.

He chooses to publish his book at a time when postcolonial critical theory is at its height, suggesting that perhaps he is deliberately satirising the revered status of the Bloomsbury Group at a time when it was popular to scrutinise modernist ideas under postcolonial light, playing on their affirmed celebrity status, made possible only by this historical gap.\n\n== The tension in the book between expos\u00e9 and homage ==\nThere is a distinct tension in the text between its presumed purpose as an expos\u00e9 of the Bloomsbury group and as an homage:\n\nThe second edition of the text is dedicated to the memory of Leonard and Virginia Woolf and E.M. Forster, suggesting a deferential and reverent attitude towards the famous Modernist circle. This is evident in the text in Anand's presentation of himself as a nervous young student of the writers her portrays; he is awestruck and nervous at meeting famous figures such as T.S Eliot and Aldous Huxley. Eliot seems to act as Anand's mentor and he does menial work for Hogarth Press of which there is no record of payment. He constantly demonstrates self-consciousness of his cultural Otherness and attempts to assimilate his behaviour with English customs. For example, he tries to eat soup quietly like an Englishman rather than slurping it in accordance with Indian stereotypes.\n\nHowever, at the same time there is a distinct undercurrent of cultural critique and social satire of both the literary figures and London as a metropolitan centre. The parallels drawn between the Indian caste system and the separation of Public and Private bars in London reveals how Anand is critical of the notion that the metropolitan centre is superior to its colonial counterpart. Anand constantly presents the famous figures as prejudiced against and ignorant of Indian customs and culture. These writers put forth their opinion on Indian culture without recognition of their ethnocentrism. For example, [[T. S. Eliot]] is shown to be narrow-minded about Indian religion despite its inclusion in his famous poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. Similarly, Clive Bell is depicted as ignorant of the wealth of Indian art, calling it 'crude craftwork' because it does not fit in with his Western notion of art for art's sake.\n\n== Depiction of Colonialism ==\nConversations in Bloomsbury depicts the London literary scene of the 1920s and 30s. A theme that runs throughout the conversations is Indian independence and the value of Indian culture. Anand brings this topic up with almost every writer featured. His own position is in favour of independence from British rule, demonstrated by his support of Gandhi's movement and being briefly jailed for his activism.\n\nWriting in a post-independence India, Anand focuses on the variety of positions he encounters within the London literary elite. These vary from the dismissal of Clive Bell to the more progressive anti-imperialist attitudes of E.M. Forster and Leonard Woolf.\n\n=== The Bloomsbury Set ===\nAnand presents the majority of the Bloomsbury Set as being relatively anti-imperialist, citing ethical objection as Leonard Woolf's main motivation for leaving the Civil Service in Ceylon. The Woolfs' Hogarth Press notably published a number of anti-imperialist texts and marginalised writers.\n\nE.M. Forster is also portrayed as anti-imperialist in his writings and attitudes. Anand specifically cites A Passage to India as a superior and more sympathetic representation of India, in contrast to Rudyard Kipling's Kim, which is praised in the opening chapters by Bonamy Dobr\u00e9e.\n\nAlthough most of the Bloomsbury Set are relatively kind and embracing of Anand and anti-imperialist attitudes, Gretchen Gerzina has argued that whilst 'the Bloomsbury Group may have been radicals in Edwardian English society, they were not radical enough.

By depicting multiple conversations between himself and canonical British authors such as Virginia Woolf and T.S. Eliot, Anand equates himself as one of the Bloomsbury group.

He found himself having to assimilate to the culture in order to fit in. In the text, he describes how he exercised self-restraint over his strong political views, and engages in an internal dialogue in which he examines the role that race plays within literary modernism. The text gives an insight into how his cultural background contributed to shaping his experience as a writer working within Eurocentric structures. He dismantles the image of modernist writers by exposing and critiquing the prejudices that influence their work.\n\nDespite his critical view of his modernist contemporaries, Anand was nonetheless influenced and inspired by them.

Wildwood House]]\n'''''Conversations in Bloomsbury''''' is a 1981 [[memoir]] that depicts writer [[Mulk Raj Anand]]'s life in London during the heyday of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], and his relationships with the group's members. It provides a rare insight into the intimate workings of the English modernist movement, portraying such prominent figures as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Anand challenges the cultural narrative that many have received about these literary figures.\n\n== Visions of the Bloomsbury Group ==\n\nAnand leaves a snapshot of the Bloomsbury Group for posterity, focalizing the individuals within the group through issues of colonial prejudice. His revelations, written decades after his experiences, and retrospectively framed by a postcolonial perspective, often give uncomfortable perspectives on the racist and casually jingoistic attitudes of a seemingly liberal movement. Commentary often engages with the significance of the British 'civilising' mission. Comments include T.S. Eliot's remark 'I wish that Indians would tone down their politics and renew their culture'.<ref>Mulk Raj Anand, ''Conversations in Bloomsbury'' (Delhi: Oxford UP, 1995) 150.</ref> Retrospectively, it is possible to point out shortcomings of these writers, inviting a re-examination of their work.\n\nThe text gives a highly subjective reading of the Bloomsbury Group, one which is elevated from a biographical recording to a complex and amusing satire of intellectual prejudice, by virtue of Anand's position on the margins of the group. The form of the text allows Anand to set up an ironic distance between the voices of the Bloomsbury Group and the silent undercurrents of their conversations. The prejudices and biases of the group become glaringly obvious because Anand guides the reader to see the dismissal of colonial cruelties that the insular nature of the group prevents them from seeing themselves.\n\nAnand expresses particular disillusion with the group's ignorance of other cultures, arguing that this is an obstacle to the modernist endeavour. He is also critical of their disengagement with both national and international politics, particularly on the issue of Indian independence.\n\n== Genre and Form ==\n\nPublished in 1981, the text's frame of reference leads the reader to question the veracity of Anand's account. Most of the people he comes across have extensive bodies of work, and the reader cannot be sure where the line is between the people he met in 1920s London and the perceived personas of these writers years later. Described by Anand in the dedication to the 1981 edition as 'gossip' and as 'reminiscences' by [[Saros Cowasjee]] (Introduction), ''Conversations'' can be classified as [[life writing]]. It resembles a memoir, with the 'snapshot' style of the narrative implying that there is an element of entertainment to its construction. The text shows stylistic influences as wide as [[melodrama]] and [[travel writing]]. Anand shows the personalities of historical figures outside of their literary context. The text also shows a self-conscious understanding of its author's own intellectual maturation.\n\nUltimately, ''Conversations in Bloomsbury'' takes the form of the memoir rather than an autobiography; the episodic conversations are structured around Anand's personal interest rather than any particular narrative. This makes his recollections of his relationships deeply personal and thereby potentially unreliable. Although the conversations may not be recorded verbatim, he gives a sense of the personalities and opinions of each figure. The very literary nature of his encounters and conversations are sometimes strained and point towards a certain degree of implausibility. For example, in chapter eighteen, Anand asks \"is it about India?\" as his first question of a new novel. He requires an alert reader to realize the ironies embedded within his writing which echoes a modernist approach to writing. The conversations in structure also are never truly resolved; this echoes the colonial and subsequently post-colonial issues that trouble Anand throughout his narrative. Martha Jane Nadell in \"Modernism and Race\" points towards the traditional tension between race and modernism as modernism, though apparently progressive, ignored issues of race. Conversations in Bloomsbury realises this tension through his unfinished conversations, inability to express himself and follow strict codes of English conduct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture|last=Bradshaw|first=David|publisher=Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nAs a text that blurs the lines between memoir, fiction, and autobiography, Conversations enacts numerous textual aspirations. It is at once a portrait of an Indian ingenue and autodidact making his way, problematically, at times, into the inner circle of the Bloomsbury group; a biographical snapshot of the group's venerated literary figures; and the ways in which Anand attempts to assert himself, and by extension, India and Indian culture, into the conversations surrounding empire and colonialism in the progressive circle of the Bloomsbury group.\n\nAnand demonstrates how the canonical modernists' discussions and texts, despite the progressive views that they represent, nevertheless demonstrate their heritage of an imperial discourse. He shows that \"modernism sought energies in the strangeness and distance of the other... in the terms that seemed to fit into its essentially Eurocentric framework\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Laura|title=Geomodernisms: Race, Modernism and Modernity|date=2005|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=49}}</ref> The conversations\u2014inaccessible as they are\u2014are way of situating Indian culture at the same level as English culture.

Although this could be seen as a mere tool of self-promotion, it also makes the point that the Indian culture Anand comes from is just as important as British culture.\n\n== Historical disparities ==\nThe historical gap between the writing, subsequent publication and the experiences depicted in Conversations in Bloomsbury gives Anand license to imagine the past and the Bloomsbury Group. However, almost contradictorily Anand is legitimised by the undeniable fact that he was there. This contradiction is allowed for by the fact that Conversations is a memoir.\n\nThe substantial distance between experience and publication allows for an extremely critical perspective, contrary to Anna Snaith's perspective of the bloomsbury group as representing \"a Britishness to do with bohemian modernity and intellectual freedoms\",<ref>{{Cite journal|title='The Hogarth Press and Networks of Anti-Colonialism'|journal=Anna Snaith.

It was built {{circa|1576|1580}} on [[Hven]], an island in the [[\u00d8resund]] between [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Scania]], [[Sweden]], which was part of [[Denmark]] at the time. It was expanded with the underground facility [[Stjerneborg]] on an adjacent site.\n\nBrahe also innovated and invented many precision instruments which he used to carry out his studies in the observatory. Research was done in the fields of astronomy, alchemy, and meteorology by Tycho and his assistants.\n\nBrahe abandoned Uraniborg and Stjerneborg in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king; he left the country, and the institution was destroyed in 1601 after his death. Hven was later lost to Sweden, and the [[Rundet\u00e5rn]] (Round Tower) in Copenhagen was inaugurated in 1642 as a replacement for Uraniborg's astronomical functions. Uraniborg's grounds are currently being restored.\n\n==History==\nThe building was dedicated to [[Urania]], the [[Muses|Muse]] of [[Astronomy]], and it was named Uraniborg, \"The Castle of Urania.\" It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe, though not the last to be built without a [[telescope]] as its primary instrument.

Only the roofs of the towers reached this level, although a single additional tower extended above the loft in the middle of the building, similar to a [[widow's walk]], accessed via a spiral staircase from the 3rd floor.

This, along with many other instruments of the observatory, was depicted and described in detail in Brahe's 1598 book ''Astronomiae instauratae mechanica''.\n\nA large wall, 75 meters on a side and 5.5 meters high, was planned to surround Uraniborg, but was never built; instead, a high earth mound was constructed. That mound has lasted until modern times, being the only remnant of the observatory still in place. Uraniborg was located in the very middle, with an extensive [[parterre]] garden between the mound walls and the building. In addition to being decorative, the gardens also supplied herbs for Brahe's medicinal chemistry experiments.

The azimuthal quadrant was meant to observe the Great Comet of 1577 with an accuracy of 48.8 seconds of an arc. He also used highly refined lenses and optical equipment in conjunction with other instruments, such as sextants and [[armillary spheres]].

This device was around 3.2 meters in diameter and was fixed in one place instead of being mobile like the smaller versions. Three years later Brahe created a larger instrument called the Great Equatorial Armillary which allowed him to gauge planetary and stellar positions. This device was able to compensate for atmospheric refraction and it remained consistent with its measurements over time.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAdditionally, the structure itself and installation of the instruments was innovative for its time and was pivotal in the accuracy of the instruments. For instance, the upgraded mural quadrant, made from metal and stone, was fixed in place as a wall. This allowed for further accuracy in the measurements recorded by Brahe. The other smaller instruments that were more sensitive to interference from the weather repositioning were also fixed in place; they were installed in recesses in the ground to provide greater protection from the wind while still having the ability to measure stellar features. The observatory was also designed so that any exposed instruments on the upper levels of the towers were well protected from exposure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Restoration ==\nA proposal was done in order to start the reconstruction of the original Uraniborg site during the 1980s. Restoration of the surrounding gardens began in 1985 with the goal of replanting of 16th century garden.

The new site now includes a restored quarter of Brahe's original garden with plants and herbs laid out in beds that are also boxed in with a wooden fence.

It was built {{circa|1576|1580}} on [[Hven]], an island in the [[\u00d8resund]] between [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Scania]], [[Sweden]], which was part of [[Denmark]] at the time. It was expanded with the underground facility [[Stjerneborg]] on an adjacent site.\n\nBrahe also innovated and invented many precision instruments which he used to carry out his studies in the observatory. Research was done in the fields of astronomy, alchemy, and meteorology by Tycho and his assistants.\n\nBrahe abandoned Uraniborg and Stjerneborg in 1597 after he fell out of favor with the Danish king; he left the country, and the institution was destroyed in 1601 after his death. Hven was later lost to Sweden, and the [[Rundet\u00e5rn]] (Round Tower) in Copenhagen was inaugurated in 1642 as a replacement for Uraniborg's astronomical functions. Uraniborg's grounds are currently being restored.\n\n==History==\nThe building was dedicated to [[Urania]], the [[Muses|Muse]] of [[Astronomy]], and it was named Uraniborg, \"The Castle of Urania.\" It was the first custom-built observatory in modern Europe, though not the last to be built without a [[telescope]] as its primary instrument. The [[cornerstone]] was laid on August 8, 1576.<ref name=\"Westman2011\">{{cite book|last=Westman|first=Robert S.|title=The Copernican Question: Prognostication, Skepticism, and Celestial Order|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEueQqLQyiIC&pg=PA236|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=July 2, 2011|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520948167|page=236}}</ref> \n\nThe sandstone and limestone-framed brick building was constructed from 1576 to 1580.

Two semi-circular towers, one each on the north and south sides of the main building, gave the building a somewhat rectangular footprint overall. The plan and fa\u00e7ade of the building, and also the plan of the surrounding gardens, are designed on grids, with proportions that Tycho carefully specified. These proportions may have been intended to make Uraniborg function as an astrological talisman, benefiting the health of its occupants by increasing the influences of the sun and Jupiter.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1163/157338211x557075| title = Tycho's Talisman: Astrological Magic in the Design of Uraniborg| journal = Early Science and Medicine| volume = 16| issue = 2| pages = 95\u2013119| year = 2011| last1 = Kwan | first1 = A. }}</ref>  The main floor consisted of four rooms, one of which was occupied by Brahe and his family, the other three for visiting astronomers. The northern tower housed the kitchens, and the southern a library. The second floor was divided into three rooms, two of equal size and one larger.

Balconies, supported on wooden posts, housed additional instruments slightly further from the building, giving them a wider angle of view. On the third floor was a loft, subdivided into eight smaller rooms for students. Only the roofs of the towers reached this level, although a single additional tower extended above the loft in the middle of the building, similar to a [[widow's walk]], accessed via a spiral staircase from the 3rd floor. Uraniborg also featured a large basement; it housed an alchemical laboratory at one end, and storage for food, salt and fuel at the other.<ref name=\"Uraniborg\">[http://www.tychobrahe.com/UK/uraniborg.html \"Uraniborg \u2013 Observatory, Laboratory and Castle\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817012511/http://www.tychobrahe.com/UK/uraniborg.html |date=August 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tycho-Brahe-Mural-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving of the mural quadrant from Brahe's book ''Astronomiae instauratae mechanica'' (1598)]]\nThe observatory had a large mural [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] affixed to a north-south wall, used to measure the [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of stars as they passed the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].

That mound has lasted until modern times, being the only remnant of the observatory still in place. Uraniborg was located in the very middle, with an extensive [[parterre]] garden between the mound walls and the building. In addition to being decorative, the gardens also supplied herbs for Brahe's medicinal chemistry experiments.

The research done at Stjerneborg paralleled the work done at Uraniborg but their notes were kept separate so that the research gathered at the observatories could be used to ensure that all of the data was accurate.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last=Hannaway|first=Owen|date=1986|title=Laboratory Design and the Aim of Science: Andreas Libavius versus Tycho Brahe|journal=Isis|volume=77|issue=4|pages=585\u2013610|issn=0021-1753|jstor=233163|doi=10.1086/354267}}</ref> Work had been started to connect Stjerneburg to the Tycho's chemistry laboratory under Uraniborg but the tunnel was never completed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[File:TychoInst5-150x232.gif|thumb|Brahe's 1581 armillary sphere.<ref name=\":2\" />]]\nThe observatory was not just the home of  scientists, but it also supported the artisans who constructed the tools that the scientists needed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jardine|first=Nicholas|date=2000|editor-last=Christianson|editor-first=John Robert|title=Many Facets of a Noble Dane|journal=Science|volume=287|issue=5462|pages=2428|issn=0036-8075|jstor=3074748|doi=10.1126/science.287.5462.2428}}</ref> Tycho Brahe was an innovative astronomer of his time.

Instead of using wood like with previous models, he built the new one out of metal and masonry to enhance its stability and therefore improve the accuracy of his measurements. The azimuthal quadrant was meant to observe the Great Comet of 1577 with an accuracy of 48.8 seconds of an arc. He also used highly refined lenses and optical equipment in conjunction with other instruments, such as sextants and [[armillary spheres]]. To increase the accuracy of his readings further, he utilized the [[equatorial coordinate system]] instead of the zodiacal coordinate system with his specially designed instruments.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.hao.ucar.edu/Education/FamousSolarPhysicists/tycho-brahes-observations-instruments|title=Tycho Brahe's Observations and Instruments {{!}} High Altitude Observatory|website=www2.hao.ucar.edu|accessdate=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1580, Brahe created the Great Globe, a hollow, wooden sphere layered with brass plates to document the stars and planets he observed. By the year 1595, over 1,000 stars had been etched onto the globe; 777 of these were placed over the majority of Brahe's time at Uraniborg, and the last 223 just before he left.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/sleepwalkershist00koes_0|title=The sleepwalkers : a history of man's changing vision of the Universe|last=Koestler|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Koestler |others=Butterfield, Herbert, 1900\u20131979 |isbn=0-14-019246-8|location=London|oclc=26056651|url-access=registration|year=1989}}</ref> He and his assistants also tracked the movements of the planets over two decades.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit00char |p=31}}</ref> Brahe then created the Triangular Sextant in 1582. This device was around 3.2 meters in diameter and was fixed in one place instead of being mobile like the smaller versions. Three years later Brahe created a larger instrument called the Great Equatorial Armillary which allowed him to gauge planetary and stellar positions. This device was able to compensate for atmospheric refraction and it remained consistent with its measurements over time.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAdditionally, the structure itself and installation of the instruments was innovative for its time and was pivotal in the accuracy of the instruments. For instance, the upgraded mural quadrant, made from metal and stone, was fixed in place as a wall. This allowed for further accuracy in the measurements recorded by Brahe. The other smaller instruments that were more sensitive to interference from the weather repositioning were also fixed in place; they were installed in recesses in the ground to provide greater protection from the wind while still having the ability to measure stellar features. The observatory was also designed so that any exposed instruments on the upper levels of the towers were well protected from exposure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Restoration ==\nA proposal was done in order to start the reconstruction of the original Uraniborg site during the 1980s. Restoration of the surrounding gardens began in 1985 with the goal of replanting of 16th century garden. Archaeological studies of the plant material were done by the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] and the Landskrona Department of Culture in order to determine the plant type and location.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lundquist|first=Kjell|date=Winter 2004|title=Reconstruction of the Planting in Uraniborg, Tycho Brahe's (1546-1601) Renaissance Garden on the Island of Ven|journal=Garden History|volume=32|issue=2|pages=152\u2013166|doi=10.2307/4150378|jstor=4150378}}</ref>\nLater in the year of 1992, a reconstruction plan for around one-quarter on the ramparts was created. This reconstruction plan included details on the ongoing work that also included the planted hypothesis on the structures, the plant material, and acquisitions and forms during the 1580s and 1590s. The new site now includes a restored quarter of Brahe's original garden with plants and herbs laid out in beds that are also boxed in with a wooden fence. A fruit orchard was also placed within the center of the pavilion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Uranienborg}}\n*[http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/tema/webudstillinger/brahe_mechanica/brahe_fsi.html?page=1 ''Astronomiae instauratae mechanica'' at the Royal Library], describing Brahe's instruments, with English translation\n\n{{coord|55|54|28|N|12|41|48|E|display=title|region:DK_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n{{Castles in Scania}} \n{{Normdaten}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1580]]\n[[Category:Scania]]\n[[Category:Tycho Brahe]]\n[[Category:Astronomical observatories in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Denmark]]\n[[Category:1580s establishments in Denmark]]\n", "name_user": "EdDavies", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eResearch:someone \u2192 some", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uraniborg"}

Goodrich was the leading scorer on that team.<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=LAL&lg=n&yr=1971 Los Angeles Lakers (1971\u201372)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205170101/http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=LAL&lg=n&yr=1971 |date=February 5, 2007 }}, accessed February 5, 2007</ref> He is also acclaimed for leading UCLA to its first two national championships under the legendary coach [[John Wooden]], the first in 1963\u201364 being a perfect 30-0 season when he played with teammate [[Walt Hazzard]]. In 1996, 17 years after his retirement from professional basketball, Goodrich was elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\n==High school career==\nA native of the Los Angeles area, Goodrich was the captain of the [[John H. Francis Polytechnic High School]] basketball team that dominated and won the 1961 Los Angeles City high school basketball championship. Goodrich scored 29 points in the championship game despite breaking his ankle in the third quarter.<ref>http://polyhighschoolclassof1982.com/</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/28/sports/sp-hssondcol28</ref>\n\n==College career==\nGoodrich has said that he had originally wanted to attend the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where his father had once been a star player. But coach [[John Wooden]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] ultimately showed much more interest in Goodrich than did USC. Like many Division I colleges, USC was wary of Goodrich's short stature. He was only {{convert|5|ft|8|in|abbr=on}} his junior year in high school and even at his ultimate height of {{convert|6|ft|1|in|abbr=on}}, he was short by college basketball standards. \n[[File:Gail Goodrich 1964.jpeg|thumb|170px|left|Goodrich in 1964]]\n\nGoodrich attended UCLA, where he finished as the school's all-time leading scorer and played on the school's first two national championship teams in 1964 and 1965. He was a two-time All-America and the Helms Foundation's \"Co-[[Helms Foundation Player of the Year|Player of the Year]]\" (along with [[Princeton University|Princeton's]] [[Bill Bradley]]) in 1965.\n\nIn the 1965 NCAA championship game, he scored a record 42 points as UCLA beat favored [[University of Michigan|Michigan]]. This record stood until 1973 when UCLA's [[Bill Walton]] scored 44 in the finals vs. [[University of Memphis|Memphis State]], and through 2007 it is still the second-highest total by a player in the championship game. While at UCLA, Goodrich was also a member of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity.\n\nA tenacious and fiery competitor, Goodrich used intelligent ball-handling skills and excellent court vision to lead two of the most successful teams in college basketball history. The left-handed junior guard was the team's main scorer. He finished with an average of 21.5 points per game and guided the 1963\u201364 UCLA Bruins to a 30-0 record. For the first time, a UCLA team won all 30 of its games en route to the school's first NCAA title. Goodrich and [[Keith Erickson]] were the only returning starters from the team that won UCLA's first national title in 1964. As a senior, the Bruins repeated as NCAA champions as Goodrich scored 24.6 points per game. At UCLA, Goodrich helped compile a 78-11 three-year record. In both of those championship seasons, Goodrich was named to the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament team. Goodrich at the time finished as UCLA's all-time leading scorer (1,690 points) which is now broken by [[Don MacLean (basketball)|Don MacLean]] (2,608 points).\n\n==NBA career==\n\n=== Los Angeles Lakers ===\nAlthough many believed Goodrich was too small for the college game and too frail for the pros, Goodrich, through perseverance and discipline, proved his doubters wrong. Goodrich was nicknamed \"Stumpy\", a moniker bestowed upon him by teammate [[Elgin Baylor]], because of Goodrich's height and short legs.\n\nGoodrich was a territorial pick by the Los Angeles Lakers in the [[1965 NBA draft]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1965.html</ref> As a rookie in 1965\u201366, he averaged about 15 minutes per game as a reserve guard behind starters [[Jerry West]] and former UCLA teammate [[Walt Hazzard]] (later known as Mahdi Abdul-Rahman). Goodrich posted averages of 7.8 points per game (ppg), 2.0 rebounds per game (rpg) and 1.6 assists per game (apg).<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1966.html</ref> On December 23, 1965, he scored a personal single-game best of 25 points against the [[San Francisco Warriors]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1966/</ref> The Lakers advanced to the NBA finals, where they lost in seven games to the [[Boston Celtics]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1966.html</ref>\n\nIn 1966\u201367, his playing time increased to over 23 minutes per game as he divided time with Hazzard at guard opposite West.<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/legends/gail-goodrich/index.html</ref> Goodrich posted averages of 12.4 ppg, 3.3 rpg and 2.7 apg. In the first game of the season he scored a career-high 30 points in a game against the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]], a feat which he duplicated six weeks later against the [[Chicago Bulls]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1967/</ref>\n\nIn 1967\u201368, his third season, Goodrich's playing time increased again, to 26 minutes per game, although it wasn't without frustration as he returned to a reserve role backing up guard [[Archie Clark (basketball)|Archie Clark]] opposite West.<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/legends/gail-goodrich/index.html</ref> Goodrich averaged 13.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg and 2.6 apg.<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01.html</ref> The Lakers returned to the NBA Finals, but they again fell to the Celtics in six games.\n\n=== Phoenix Suns ===\nIn 1968, the Lakers lost Goodrich to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the expansion draft,<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/legends/gail-goodrich/index.html</ref> and he quickly became the star of the new franchise and a favorite among Suns fans. A full-time starter for the first time in his NBA career in 1968\u201369, Goodrich showed what was to come as he scored at least 22 points in each of the Suns' first 11 games.<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1969/</ref> In December 1968, he exploded for 40 points against the Warriors, but topped that later with 43 against the Bulls and, on March 9, 1969, he scored 47 against the [[San Diego Rockets]].<ref>|</ref> For the season, Goodrich scored 23.8 points per game \u2014 sixth in the league and tops on his team. He surprised critics who had labeled him a gunner by ranking seventh in assists with 6.4 per game along with 5.4 rpg. He was selected to play in the [[1969 NBA All-Star Game]]. In 1969\u201370, Goodrich scored 20.0 ppg and 7.5 apg (both tops on the team). After the season, on May 20, 1970, he was traded back to the Lakers in exchange for [[Mel Counts]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01.html</ref>\n\n=== Return to the Lakers ===\nFor the 1970\u201371 season, now as a Lakers starter alongside Jerry West, Goodrich averaged 17.5 ppg as the Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe 1971\u201372 Lakers season was one that would go down in history, with Goodrich a major factor. Goodrich, playing all 82 games, averaged a career-high 25.9 ppg, including 28 games of 30 points or more, to go with 3.6 rpg and 4.5 apg. The Lakers posted an NBA-record 33 consecutive wins en route to an NBA-best 69-13 record led by Goodrich and fellow future Hall-of-Famers Jerry West, [[Wilt Chamberlain]], and Elgin Baylor (although Baylor was out most of the year due to injury). The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals, where they dismantled the [[New York Knicks]] in five games to win the NBA championship<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1972.html</ref> as Goodrich averaged a series-leading 25.6 ppg.<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1972_finals.html#LAL-NYK</ref>\n\n[[File:Gail Goodrich 1973.jpeg|thumb|upright|Goodrich with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1973]]\nGoodrich led the Lakers in scoring in 1971\u201372, 1972\u201373, 1973\u201374, and 1974\u201375. From the 1968\u201369 season through the 1975\u201376 season, Goodrich scored an average of 22.4 points a game, among the best in the NBA during that period, while also averaging over five assists per game.\n\nThe 1973\u201374 season was the best all-around season in his career. He was first-team All-NBA and again an all-star. He scored over 2,000 points and averaged 25.3 points a game \u2014 fourth in the league in scoring \u2014 while leading the NBA in free throws made and free throw attempts as he drove the basket perhaps more than at any point in his career. On October 28, 1973 he fired in a career-high 49 points against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1974/</ref> In 1973\u201374, he was in the second year of earning $180,000 per season.\n\nGoodrich, then 31, dropped about {{convert|10|lb}} for the 1974\u201375 season stating, \"I decided prior to this season that I would lose about 10 pounds to get down to my college playing weight of 172 ... I'm sure it helps with my quickness and my stamina.\" Goodrich led the Lakers in scoring with a 22.6 per game average. On March 28, 1975, for the first time in his career, Goodrich topped 50 points in a game with 53 against the [[Kansas City-Omaha Kings]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1974/</ref>\n\nGoodrich held out in the fall of 1975 and missed the first four games while playing out his option to become a free agent the following season. In the 1975\u201376 season, Goodrich switched roles, becoming the \"playmaking\" guard rather than the \"shooting guard\", switching spots with [[Lucius Allen]]. Goodrich had played a similar role in Phoenix, but during his time with Jerry West, Goodrich was the shooting guard. Ironically, Allen was the shooting guard when he played with [[Oscar Robertson]] on the champion [[Milwaukee Bucks]] team. So, both were familiar with the roles. According to a [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] newspaper, the switch worked and \"did wonders for a slumping Laker team\". That same season the Lakers had acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to upgrade the center position from previous center [[Elmore Smith]].\n\n=== Utah/New Orleans Jazz ===\nOn August 6, 1976, Goodrich signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth $1.4 million, with the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]], where he teamed in the backcourt with [[Pete Maravich]]. Early in the 1976\u201377 season, Goodrich sustained an Achilles heel injury that required surgery. In January 1977, Goodrich filed a lawsuit against the Lakers, alleging that he was shorted over $150,000 of his $275,000 1975\u201376 season salary due to fines for missing training camp and for pre-season and some regular season games. The lawsuit also asked for $75,000 punitive damages, stating that the fines were a \"breach of contract\".<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19760328&id=JB1PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3153,5001583</ref> He rehabilitated the leg and prepared hard for the 1977\u201378 season and it seemingly paid off as he averaged 16.1 points a game and shot a career-best .495 from the field as a 34-year-old guard.\n\nHe played one final campaign in 1978\u201379, the 14th of his career. After averaging 12.7 ppg in 74 games, Goodrich retired, having scored 19,181 career points.\n\nHis impact upon the Lakers franchise extended far beyond his playing years. When he signed with the Jazz in 1976, per league rules at the time, the Lakers were to receive compensation for losing a veteran free agent. The Lakers and Jazz agreed to send New Orleans' regular first-round pick from the 1979 draft to Los Angeles (along with first-round picks in 1977 and 1978 and an additional second-round pick). When the Jazz finished the 1978\u201379 season with the worst record in the NBA, the Lakers were eligible for one of the top two picks of that draft. Until 1985, the two teams with the worst records flipped a coin to determine which team would receive the top pick. The Lakers won the coin flip against the [[Chicago Bulls]], who selected David Greenwood second. The Lakers selected [[Magic Johnson]]. They used the first round pick in 1977 for [[Kenny Carr]] and they traded the 1978 first round selection to Boston, who took [[Freeman Williams]].\n\n== Legacy ==\nFor his career, Goodrich was a five-time All-Star and was All-NBA in 1973\u201374. He is still the third all-time scorer among lefties in NBA history. At the time of his retirement in 1979, Goodrich was 11th all-time in scoring and 10th all-time in assists.\n\nGoodrich ranks among all-time Lakers leaders in several categories, including total points (sixth, 13,044), assists (seventh, 2,863), free throws made (seventh, 2,830) and games played (ninth, 687).\n\nOn November 20, 1996, the Lakers retired his #25 jersey, with then-Laker star [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] changing his jersey number from 25 to 6. In 2003, Poly High held a ceremony to retire his #12.<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/28/sports/sp-hssondcol28</ref> On December 18, 2004, UCLA retired his #25.\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter his basketball career, Goodrich and his second wife, Toni, eventually settled in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He has three children from his first marriage\u2014a son and twin daughters.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/weekly/catchingup/0427/</ref> Goodrich became an executive with a golf course management company, American Golf Corporation in [[Santa Monica, California]]. In 1996, he left American Golf and became the president of National Fairways, a golf company in Greenwich. In his tenure at National Fairways, Goodrich purchased [[Forsgate Country Club]] in [[New Jersey]] in partnership with another golf firm, RDC Golf. He sold his interest in Forsgate in 1999 and retired from the golf industry. Goodrich serves as a studio analyst for [[NBA TV]].\n\n== NBA career statistics ==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|champion=y}}\n\n=== Regular season ===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{Nbay|1965}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[1965\u201366 Los Angeles Lakers season|L.A.

He is best known for scoring a then record 42 points for [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] in the 1965 NCAA championship game vs. Michigan, and his part in the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372 season]]. During that season the team won a still-record 33 consecutive games, posted what was at the time the best regular season record in NBA history, and also won the franchise's first NBA championship since relocating to Los Angeles. Goodrich was the leading scorer on that team.<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=LAL&lg=n&yr=1971 Los Angeles Lakers (1971\u201372)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205170101/http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=LAL&lg=n&yr=1971 |date=February 5, 2007 }}, accessed February 5, 2007</ref> He is also acclaimed for leading UCLA to its first two national championships under the legendary coach [[John Wooden]], the first in 1963\u201364 being a perfect 30-0 season when he played with teammate [[Walt Hazzard]]. In 1996, 17 years after his retirement from professional basketball, Goodrich was elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\n==High school career==\nA native of the Los Angeles area, Goodrich was the captain of the [[John H. Francis Polytechnic High School]] basketball team that dominated and won the 1961 Los Angeles City high school basketball championship. Goodrich scored 29 points in the championship game despite breaking his ankle in the third quarter.<ref>http://polyhighschoolclassof1982.com/</ref><ref>https://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/28/sports/sp-hssondcol28</ref>\n\n==College career==\nGoodrich has said that he had originally wanted to attend the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where his father had once been a star player. But coach [[John Wooden]] of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] ultimately showed much more interest in Goodrich than did USC. Like many Division I colleges, USC was wary of Goodrich's short stature. He was only {{convert|5|ft|8|in|abbr=on}} his junior year in high school and even at his ultimate height of {{convert|6|ft|1|in|abbr=on}}, he was short by college basketball standards. \n[[File:Gail Goodrich 1964.jpeg|thumb|170px|left|Goodrich in 1964]]\n\nGoodrich attended UCLA, where he finished as the school's all-time leading scorer and played on the school's first two national championship teams in 1964 and 1965. He was a two-time All-America and the Helms Foundation's \"Co-[[Helms Foundation Player of the Year|Player of the Year]]\" (along with [[Princeton University|Princeton's]] [[Bill Bradley]]) in 1965.\n\nIn the 1965 NCAA championship game, he scored a record 42 points as UCLA beat favored [[University of Michigan|Michigan]]. This record stood until 1973 when UCLA's [[Bill Walton]] scored 44 in the finals vs. [[University of Memphis|Memphis State]], and through 2007 it is still the second-highest total by a player in the championship game. While at UCLA, Goodrich was also a member of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity.\n\nA tenacious and fiery competitor, Goodrich used intelligent ball-handling skills and excellent court vision to lead two of the most successful teams in college basketball history. The left-handed junior guard was the team's main scorer. He finished with an average of 21.5 points per game and guided the 1963\u201364 UCLA Bruins to a 30-0 record. For the first time, a UCLA team won all 30 of its games en route to the school's first NCAA title. Goodrich and [[Keith Erickson]] were the only returning starters from the team that won UCLA's first national title in 1964. As a senior, the Bruins repeated as NCAA champions as Goodrich scored 24.6 points per game. At UCLA, Goodrich helped compile a 78-11 three-year record. In both of those championship seasons, Goodrich was named to the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament team. Goodrich at the time finished as UCLA's all-time leading scorer (1,690 points) which is now broken by [[Don MacLean (basketball)|Don MacLean]] (2,608 points).\n\n==NBA career==\n\n=== Los Angeles Lakers ===\nAlthough many believed Goodrich was too small for the college game and too frail for the pros, Goodrich, through perseverance and discipline, proved his doubters wrong. Goodrich was nicknamed \"Stumpy\", a moniker bestowed upon him by teammate [[Elgin Baylor]], because of Goodrich's height and short legs.\n\nGoodrich was a territorial pick by the Los Angeles Lakers in the [[1965 NBA draft]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1965.html</ref> As a rookie in 1965\u201366, he averaged about 15 minutes per game as a reserve guard behind starters [[Jerry West]] and former UCLA teammate [[Walt Hazzard]] (later known as Mahdi Abdul-Rahman). Goodrich posted averages of 7.8 points per game (ppg), 2.0 rebounds per game (rpg) and 1.6 assists per game (apg).<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1966.html</ref> On December 23, 1965, he scored a personal single-game best of 25 points against the [[San Francisco Warriors]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1966/</ref> The Lakers advanced to the NBA finals, where they lost in seven games to the [[Boston Celtics]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1966.html</ref>\n\nIn 1966\u201367, his playing time increased to over 23 minutes per game as he divided time with Hazzard at guard opposite West.<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/legends/gail-goodrich/index.html</ref> Goodrich posted averages of 12.4 ppg, 3.3 rpg and 2.7 apg. In the first game of the season he scored a career-high 30 points in a game against the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]], a feat which he duplicated six weeks later against the [[Chicago Bulls]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1967/</ref>\n\nIn 1967\u201368, his third season, Goodrich's playing time increased again, to 26 minutes per game, although it wasn't without frustration as he returned to a reserve role backing up guard [[Archie Clark (basketball)|Archie Clark]] opposite West.<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/legends/gail-goodrich/index.html</ref> Goodrich averaged 13.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg and 2.6 apg.<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01.html</ref> The Lakers returned to the NBA Finals, but they again fell to the Celtics in six games.\n\n=== Phoenix Suns ===\nIn 1968, the Lakers lost Goodrich to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the expansion draft,<ref>http://www.nba.com/history/legends/gail-goodrich/index.html</ref> and he quickly became the star of the new franchise and a favorite among Suns fans. A full-time starter for the first time in his NBA career in 1968\u201369, Goodrich showed what was to come as he scored at least 22 points in each of the Suns' first 11 games.<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1969/</ref> In December 1968, he exploded for 40 points against the Warriors, but topped that later with 43 against the Bulls and, on March 9, 1969, he scored 47 against the [[San Diego Rockets]].<ref>|</ref> For the season, Goodrich scored 23.8 points per game \u2014 sixth in the league and tops on his team. He surprised critics who had labeled him a gunner by ranking seventh in assists with 6.4 per game along with 5.4 rpg. He was selected to play in the [[1969 NBA All-Star Game]]. In 1969\u201370, Goodrich scored 20.0 ppg and 7.5 apg (both tops on the team). After the season, on May 20, 1970, he was traded back to the Lakers in exchange for [[Mel Counts]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01.html</ref>\n\n=== Return to the Lakers ===\nFor the 1970\u201371 season, now as a Lakers starter alongside Jerry West, Goodrich averaged 17.5 ppg as the Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe 1971\u201372 Lakers season was one that would go down in history, with Goodrich a major factor. Goodrich, playing all 82 games, averaged a career-high 25.9 ppg, including 28 games of 30 points or more, to go with 3.6 rpg and 4.5 apg. The Lakers posted an NBA-record 33 consecutive wins en route to an NBA-best 69-13 record led by Goodrich and fellow future Hall-of-Famers Jerry West, [[Wilt Chamberlain]], and Elgin Baylor (although Baylor was out most of the year due to injury). The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals, where they dismantled the [[New York Knicks]] in five games to win the NBA championship<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1972.html</ref> as Goodrich averaged a series-leading 25.6 ppg.<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1972_finals.html#LAL-NYK</ref>\n\n[[File:Gail Goodrich 1973.jpeg|thumb|upright|Goodrich with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in 1973]]\nGoodrich led the Lakers in scoring in 1971\u201372, 1972\u201373, 1973\u201374, and 1974\u201375. From the 1968\u201369 season through the 1975\u201376 season, Goodrich scored an average of 22.4 points a game, among the best in the NBA during that period, while also averaging over five assists per game.\n\nThe 1973\u201374 season was the best all-around season in his career. He was first-team All-NBA and again an all-star. He scored over 2,000 points and averaged 25.3 points a game \u2014 fourth in the league in scoring \u2014 while leading the NBA in free throws made and free throw attempts as he drove the basket perhaps more than at any point in his career. On October 28, 1973 he fired in a career-high 49 points against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1974/</ref> In 1973\u201374, he was in the second year of earning $180,000 per season.\n\nGoodrich, then 31, dropped about {{convert|10|lb}} for the 1974\u201375 season stating, \"I decided prior to this season that I would lose about 10 pounds to get down to my college playing weight of 172 ... I'm sure it helps with my quickness and my stamina.\" Goodrich led the Lakers in scoring with a 22.6 per game average. On March 28, 1975, for the first time in his career, Goodrich topped 50 points in a game with 53 against the [[Kansas City-Omaha Kings]].<ref>https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/goodrga01/gamelog/1974/</ref>\n\nGoodrich held out in the fall of 1975 and missed the first four games while playing out his option to become a free agent the following season. In the 1975\u201376 season, Goodrich switched roles, becoming the \"playmaking\" guard rather than the \"shooting guard\", switching spots with [[Lucius Allen]]. Goodrich had played a similar role in Phoenix, but during his time with Jerry West, Goodrich was the shooting guard. Ironically, Allen was the shooting guard when he played with [[Oscar Robertson]] on the champion [[Milwaukee Bucks]] team. So, both were familiar with the roles. According to a [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] newspaper, the switch worked and \"did wonders for a slumping Laker team\". That same season the Lakers had acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to upgrade the center position from previous center [[Elmore Smith]].\n\n=== Utah/New Orleans Jazz ===\nOn August 6, 1976, Goodrich signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth $1.4 million, with the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]], where he teamed in the backcourt with [[Pete Maravich]]. Early in the 1976\u201377 season, Goodrich sustained an Achilles heel injury that required surgery. In January 1977, Goodrich filed a lawsuit against the Lakers, alleging that he was shorted over $150,000 of his $275,000 1975\u201376 season salary due to fines for missing training camp and for pre-season and some regular season games. The lawsuit also asked for $75,000 punitive damages, stating that the fines were a \"breach of contract\".<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19760328&id=JB1PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3153,5001583</ref> He rehabilitated the leg and prepared hard for the 1977\u201378 season and it seemingly paid off as he averaged 16.1 points a game and shot a career-best .495 from the field as a 34-year-old guard.\n\nHe played one final campaign in 1978\u201379, the 14th of his career. After averaging 12.7 ppg in 74 games, Goodrich retired, having scored 19,181 career points.\n\nHis impact upon the Lakers franchise extended far beyond his playing years. When he signed with the Jazz in 1976, per league rules at the time, the Lakers were to receive compensation for losing a veteran free agent. The Lakers and Jazz agreed to send New Orleans' regular first-round pick from the 1979 draft to Los Angeles (along with first-round picks in 1977 and 1978 and an additional second-round pick). When the Jazz finished the 1978\u201379 season with the worst record in the NBA, the Lakers were eligible for one of the top two picks of that draft. Until 1985, the two teams with the worst records flipped a coin to determine which team would receive the top pick. The Lakers won the coin flip against the [[Chicago Bulls]], who selected David Greenwood second. The Lakers selected [[Magic Johnson]]. They used the first round pick in 1977 for [[Kenny Carr]] and they traded the 1978 first round selection to Boston, who took [[Freeman Williams]].\n\n== Legacy ==\nFor his career, Goodrich was a five-time All-Star and was All-NBA in 1973\u201374. He is still the third all-time scorer among lefties in NBA history. At the time of his retirement in 1979, Goodrich was 11th all-time in scoring and 10th all-time in assists.\n\nGoodrich ranks among all-time Lakers leaders in several categories, including total points (sixth, 13,044), assists (seventh, 2,863), free throws made (seventh, 2,830) and games played (ninth, 687).\n\nOn November 20, 1996, the Lakers retired his #25 jersey, with then-Laker star [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] changing his jersey number from 25 to 6. In 2003, Poly High held a ceremony to retire his #12.<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/28/sports/sp-hssondcol28</ref> On December 18, 2004, UCLA retired his #25.\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter his basketball career, Goodrich and his second wife, Toni, eventually settled in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He has three children from his first marriage\u2014a son and twin daughters.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/weekly/catchingup/0427/</ref> Goodrich became an executive with a golf course management company, American Golf Corporation in [[Santa Monica, California]]. In 1996, he left American Golf and became the president of National Fairways, a golf company in Greenwich. In his tenure at National Fairways, Goodrich purchased [[Forsgate Country Club]] in [[New Jersey]] in partnership with another golf firm, RDC Golf. He sold his interest in Forsgate in 1999 and retired from the golf industry. Goodrich serves as a studio analyst for [[NBA TV]].\n\n== NBA career statistics ==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|champion=y}}\n\n=== Regular season ===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{Nbay|1965}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[1965\u201366 Los Angeles Lakers season|L.A.
