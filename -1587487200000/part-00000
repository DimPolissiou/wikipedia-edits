In 1976 the family moved to the small college town of [[Athens, Ohio]], home of [[Ohio University]]. Ben attended elementary and middle school in Athens while his father taught in the graduate theater program there. In 1980 Peter Sander received a [[Pell grant]] and moved the family to [[Cleveland, OH]], where he acted as a [[Dramaturge]] for [[Cleveland Play House|The Cleveland Play House]]. The Playhouse offered Ben his first opportunity to act professionally. He was cast as Bodo in a production of [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]''. The family returned to Athens in 1981 for two years. In 1983 Peter took a job with The University of Missouri in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where Ben attended Center Senior High School. Ben performed in high school theatrical productions, but eventually forsook the stage for the costume room becoming the costume designer during his senior year, using his extensive collection of vintage clothing as costumes for the productions that year. After graduating high school in 1987 Sander attended the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] foundations program.\n\nIn 1988 the family again moved; this time to [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]], where his father had been hired as the chair for the theater department of [[Hofstra University]]. Ben worked at various jobs in [[New York City]] and also studied fashion illustration with Veronica Galati. He then applied to, and was accepted into the fashion design program at [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in 1989. After four years of study, Sander graduated in 1993, and obtained a job at moderate dress house, BGB as an assistant designer. His job was making patterns for the samples; the company reorganized nine months after he was hired and he was let go. After that he worked at a bridal boutique, and two [[Fur clothing|furriers]] before moving into Manhattan and developing ''The Brini Maxwell Show'' for television.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title | 0389584 | The Brini Maxwell Show}}\n*{{Official website|brinimaxwell.com}}\n*{{YouTube|c=UCgoeQmZa-mIyTzI29hlNZPw}}\n*{{Facebook|Brini.TV}}\n*{{Twitter|BriniMaxwell}}\n*[http://outsideleft.com/main.php?updateID=782 Brini Maxwell, Outsideleft's Happy Shopper]\n*[http://www.phillygaycalendar.com/pages/video.php?id=77 Brini Maxwell interview in Philadelphia (video)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maxwell, Brini}}\n[[Category:American drag queens]]\n[[Category:Comedy characters]]\n", "text_old": "Sabrina '''\u201cBrini\u201d Maxwell''' is the [[Drag queen|drag persona]] of '''Ben Sander''', described as the \"prototypical, pre-feminist, 1960s homemaker.\"<ref name=\"VV1999\">{{cite web | last=Trebay | first=Guy | title=Heroine Addiction | website=[[The Village Voice]] | date=1999-11-09 | url=https://www.villagevoice.com/1999/11/09/heroine-addiction/ | access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> Maxwell has also been described as a composite of [[Doris Day]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Auntie Mame]], [[That Girl]], and [[Donna Reed]]; the character came to prominence in the late '90s as the host of her eponymous television show on [[Public-access television|public access]] in [[Manhattan]], and later on the national [[cable television]] [[Style Network]].\n\n==Television==\n\n===Cable access show===\n\nThe pilot for the original ''Brini Maxwell Show'' debuted on [[Manhattan Neighborhood Network]] on January 1, 1998.

After graduating high school in 1987 Sander attended the [[Kansas City Art Institute]] foundations program.\n\nIn 1988 the family again moved; this time to [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]], where his father had been hired as the chair for the theater department of [[Hofstra University]]. Ben worked at various jobs in [[New York City]] and also studied fashion illustration with Veronica Galati. He then applied to, and was accepted into the fashion design program at [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in 1989. After four years of study, Sander graduated in 1993, and obtained a job at moderate dress house, BGB as an assistant designer. His job was making patterns for the samples; the company reorganized nine months after he was hired and he was let go. After that he worked at a bridal boutique, and two [[Fur clothing|furriers]] before moving into Manhattan and developing ''The Brini Maxwell Show'' for television.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title | 0389584 | The Brini Maxwell Show}}\n*{{Official website|brinimaxwell.com}}\n*{{YouTube|c=UCgoeQmZa-mIyTzI29hlNZPw}}\n*{{Facebook|Brini.TV}}\n*{{Twitter|BriniMaxwell}}\n*[http://outsideleft.com/main.php?updateID=782 Brini Maxwell, Outsideleft's Happy Shopper]\n*[http://www.phillygaycalendar.com/pages/video.php?id=77 Brini Maxwell interview in Philadelphia (video)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maxwell, Brini}}\n[[Category:American drag queens]]\n[[Category:Comedy characters]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brini_Maxwell"}

In this configuration, Cummins first raced the aircraft in 1972. In 1973 he qualified the airplane in the third position for the Unlimited Class Gold Race and he took second place behind [[Lyle Shelton]]'s winning [[Grumman F8F Bearcat|Bearcat]]. He did win the 1976 National Air Races at [[Mojave, California]], with a winning speed of 422 miles per hour (679&nbsp;km/h). After racing the aircraft for several years with limited success, he sold the aircraft in 1979 to Wiley Sanders of Sanders Truck Lines.<ref name=Jeannie />\n\nSanders renamed the aircraft ''Jeannie'', after his wife.  The aircraft was rebuilt with an eye to weight reduction.  In the end, 600 pounds (270&nbsp;kg) were removed from the airframe.<ref name=Carter />  Roy \"Mac\" McLain flew the aircraft in 1979 at the Reno Air Races. Shortly before the 1980 air races, the aircraft was damaged in a crash at the [[Van Nuys Airport]]. In a frantic effort, the aircraft was rebuilt and again flown by McLain, winning the Gold Race at Reno just days later. At the 1981 Reno Air Races, Skip Holm piloted the aircraft to victory in the Unlimited Class Gold Race. The following year, the aircraft suffered an engine failure and did not participate in the Gold Race.<ref name=Jeannie />\n\nThe aircraft was sold to Jimmy Leeward in 1983, shortly after the aircraft's wing span had been reduced another six feet (180&nbsp;cm).<ref name=\"EAA Sport Aviation\">{{cite journal|last=Davison|first=Budd|title=Reviving a Ghost|journal=Sport Aviation|date=May 2011|volume=60|issue=5|pages=34\u201339|url=http://www.sportaviationonline.org/sportaviation/201105#pg41|accessdate=September 17, 2011|publisher=[[Experimental Aircraft Association]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923153813/http://www.sportaviationonline.org/sportaviation/201105/#pg41|archivedate=September 23, 2011|df=}}</ref> Leeward initially raced the aircraft as ''Specter'', race number X.<ref>[http://www.mustangsmustangs.com/p-51/survivors/pages/picfiles/44-15651/44-15651_15_es1.jpg Picture of Specter] Retrieved September 25, 2011.</ref>  He later raced the aircraft at Reno as race number 9 and later race number 44 \"The Leeward Air Ranch Special.\"<ref name=Carter /> After an engine failure at the 1989 Reno Air Races forced Leeward to land the airplane on a dirt road,<ref name=Carter /> the aircraft did not appear at the races between 1990 and 2009.\n\nIn 2010, the ''Galloping Ghost'' returned to the Reno races.<ref name=\"Wrbrdreg\" />\n\n==2011 Reno Air Races crash==\n{{main|2011 Reno Air Races crash}}\nIn 2011, Leeward flew the aircraft again in the [[Reno Air Races]].

The 1998 incident did not lead to a crash, but Hannah reported that when the elevator trim tab came off, the airplane pitched up and subjected him to over 10 ''[[G-force|g]]'' and a loss of consciousness. When he regained consciousness, the plane had climbed to over 9,000 feet (2,750 m).

Following his death in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Fury resurrected Coulson using T.A.H.I.T.I., and had his memories of the project replaced. Coulson puts together a team of agents, and they travel the world dealing with strange new cases. During this time, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier#Plot|is revealed to have]] infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to the latter's demise. Fury makes Coulson the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and tasks him with rebuilding the agency \"the right way\". Coulson becomes romantically involved with Rosalind Price, the leader of an anti-[[Inhumans|Inhuman]] government taskforce, until her death at the hands of Grant Ward, one of Coulson's former agents. He gets revenge by crushing Ward's chest with his prosthetic hand. Following [[Captain America: Civil War#Plot|the signing of]] the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized, with the still officially dead Coulson replaced as director. In the Framework virtual reality, Coulson teaches about the dangers of Inhumans. It is later discovered that Phil Coulson is dying due to the side effect of having Ghost Rider in him during the final battle with Aida. Following the final battle with the gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, Coulson retires to live out his last days on Tahiti with May.\n\n[[File:Clark Gregg WonderCon 2016.png|thumb|right|upright|Clark Gregg]]\nPhil Coulson was created for ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'';<ref name=\"April2006Variety\" /><ref name=\"FergusOstbyIM\" /> he was the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent introduced in the MCU, and was portrayed by Gregg, who went on to play the character in several other MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]].<ref name=\"OneShots\" /> At the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]], Gregg was announced to be starring as Coulson in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', despite the character dying in ''The Avengers''.\"<ref name=\"NYCC2012\" /> In April 2013, Gregg said that he had found creator [[Joss Whedon]]'s explanation for Coulson's resurrection \"fascinating\" and \"true to the world of the comics and mythology in general\".<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> On whether the resurrected Coulson would be the same as before he died, Gregg said \"I think if he hadn\u2019t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn\u2019t be any good.\"<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> After Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said \"He kind of got his dream job that I don\u2019t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given ... it\u2019s going to require him to move a little bit in the direction of a more pragmatic figure like Nick Fury\".<ref name=\"GreggRebuilding\" /> Discussing Coulson's character progression through three seasons, executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] said, \"First season Coulson would have beat Ward up and then thrown him over his shoulder and brought him back to Earth and locked him away. Season two Coulson would have defeated him and left him there on the other planet to fend for himself,\" while season three Coulson paused while a portal to Earth was closing to take the time to kill Ward.<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" /> Speaking to the final episode of season five, which sees Coulson retires to live out his last days on Tahiti, Gregg said, \"My understanding is that Phil Coulson is no longer alive. He's been brought back, he's been really clear that he didn't want supernatural measures used again. I always felt like he thought almost like he wasn't supposed to be here... I don't think there is a real buy back for the fact that this deal he made with the Ghost Rider is killing his body.\" Gregg also noted he was talking with the series showrunners about appearing in some form in the sixth season, as there had been some interest in including him.<ref name=\"GreggTHRMay2018\" />\n\n====Sarge / Pachakutiq====\nSarge (portrayed by Clark Gregg) is a man who looks like Phil Coulson; even having the same D.N.A. He leads a group of mercenaries consisting of Jaco, Pax, and Snowflake to Earth on a mission involving targeting people possessed by alien parasites. Then they raided Deke Shaw's tech company to target Deke himself, which ends with Sarge and Snowflake making off with May while Jaco and Pax are apprehended. After being forced to kill another parasite-infected person, May learns that Sarge is a long-lived alien who has been leading his group in hunting the parasites called Shrikes, which have been decimating worlds on behalf of their creator, and that Sarge intends to stop them once and for all. May overpowers Sarge and Snowflake, commandeers their vehicle, and drives back to the Lighthouse. While he and his group are in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Sarge reveals that the Shrikes' creator, Izel, has destroyed his planet and his family; leading him onto his path of revenge. Following his failed attempt to blow up the Shrike tower and take on Izel's ship, Sarge is detained by S.H.I.E.L.D. May appears in his cell and shoots him while possessed by Izel. After recovering and healing, Sarge broke free from his restraints and confronts Izel where the Gravitonium generator holding the powers of the Di'Allas is. Sarge is left confused when Izel claims that he is from a non-corporeal world like her and that the \"family\" is Coulson's memories of his team. Sarge then remembers that his real name is Pachakutiq and how he is merely possessing a clone body of Coulson which was created by the powers of the Di'Allas and sent hundred years into the past on his and Izel's home planet. Despite this, he still believes Izel's his enemy, though he unknowingly starts to manifest powers. After being confronted by Daisy and fully realizing his powers, it's revealed traces of Coulson lie inside Sarge and that he wants to die before he hurts anyone else. When it came to the fight with Izel, Sarge remembers who and what he is and stabs May with his sword while sending her to the other side as a sign. He then fought Mack and Daisy where his true form was revealed. Once May returned from the other side and stabbed Izel with the sword, Daisy stunned him with her abilities so Mack could destroy Pachakutiq with his sword.\n\n====Phil Coulson (Chronicom L.M.D.)====\nFollowing the deaths of Izel and Sarge, Enoch and the Chronicoms on his side were able to create a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) enhanced with Chronicom technology. He was created with all of Coulson's memories, as if he didn't miss anything, and will help deal with the Chronicom hunters led by Malachi.\n\n=== Melinda May ===\n{{Main|Melinda May}}\nMelinda Qiaolian May (portrayed by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. ace pilot and weapons expert who is called \"the Cavalry\", against her wishes, after a mission to [[Bahrain]] where she saved an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team from a rogue gifted\u2014unbeknownst to S.H.I.E.L.D., she did this by killing a young girl named Katya Belyakov. Still struggling to move past this event years later, May agrees to watch her old friend and partner Coulson for Fury, reporting to the latter and looking for potential side-effects of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. in the former. When Coulson becomes the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., May acts as his second-in-command, and over time begins to move past the events of Bahrain and even develop familial relationships with characters such as [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]]. In the Framework, May did not kill Belyakov and becomes a top operative within Hydra. Following the fight against the gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, May joins Coulson on his final days on Tahiti. In season six, she assists in dealing with threats involving Sarge's group and Izel. She gets stabbed by Sarge and sent to the other side where she prevents three of Izel's people from unleashing their kind. After getting back to Earth, she killed Izel and collapsed from her injuries. Simmons arrives and places May in the same pod that contained Fitz' body so that she can recuperate.\n\n[[File:Ming-Na Wen by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ming-Na Wen]]\nWen was cast as May in October 2012.<ref name=\"Oct2012MingNa\" /> Whedon had the character, who was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets,<ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /> \"rolling around in his head\" for a long time.<ref name=\"WenHitFix\" /> In preparation for the role, Wen was \"given a couple of background stories\" about May, but found it challenging to play a character who is respected by those around her when the audience doesn't know why, stating \"It's a challenge in different ways....I use some of my own personal experience where we've been scarred or we've been greatly disappointed\".<ref name=\"WenHitFix\" /> When May's past was revealed in \"[[Melinda (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Melinda]]\", Wen called it \"devastating\", explaining \"She was married, she was in love with Andrew, she had a job that she excelled at and loved and believed in\u2014so her world was pretty perfect...To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many...I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat.\"<ref name=\"WenMelinda\" /> May's shirt is the same blue as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in ''The Avengers'' such as [[Maria Hill]], so as to have some continuity between her uniform and those established in the films. The rest of her costume is inspired by military flight suits, including a leather vest, and pants with stretch panels to aid with fighting.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" />\n\nFollowing the series premiere, Wen teased the character, saying that \"she's very much the observer, and whenever she wants to put in her two cents, it's something that you want to listen to and kind of pay attention to...She's slow in getting acclimated to part of the group and being in the field again.\"<ref name=\"WenZap2it\" /> Talking about May's reasons for staying with S.H.I.E.L.D., Wen explained \"May\u2019s friendship and...loyalty and her love for Coulson [keeps her there]. Maybe not romantic [love], it\u2019s just really\u2014it\u2019s hard to describe\u2014it\u2019s a bond, it\u2019s unbreakable, and she will watch over Coulson and take care of him and help him through whatever he needs to at this point in his life... She wants to be there for him, and if it serves S.H.I.E.L.D., that\u2019s just more or less a side effect, really.\"<ref name=\"WenRebuilding\" /> Wen admitted that May develops a relationship with Skye over the course of the series, going from thinking of Skye as \"someone that she didn\u2019t want as part of the team and didn\u2019t understand why Coulson wanted her\" to wanting Skye \"to be the best agent that she can be.\" After discovering that Skye is an Inhuman, Wen stated that \"it\u2019s like when you have your child or your daughter losing control or getting involved with situations or people that you\u2019re not sure about. You don\u2019t have the control anymore. It\u2019s very frightening. For Skye to be an unknown entity, May still holds out hope. She hopes that her training with her will help her be able to control her new powers, but you never know. Sometimes the power overtakes everything else.\"<ref name=\"WenSkyeInhuman\" />\n\nOn how May deals with her ex-husband Andrew becoming the Inhuman killer Lash, Wen said, \"She's come to the understanding that it was something he had no control over. The betrayal might be not sharing that information of what happened to him with her. I think she understands that, in a way, he was scared and trying to be protective of their relationship and doing it all for the wrong reasons. I think, ultimately, Agent May is kind of shut down when it comes to Lash and Andrew at this point. That's why she's re-focusing all her energy back into S.H.I.E.L.D., back being by Coulson's side. That's where she's most comfortable.\"<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" /> Wen went on to describe May as \"unconventionally maternal...she's taking care of Simmons and really believing that she needs to be able to protect herself, she's very, very concerned about the family's well being.\"<ref name=\"CBRTakingCharge\" />\n\nWen received nominations for 'Favorite Actress in a New TV Series' at the [[40th People's Choice Awards]] and 'Favorite Female TV Star \u2013 Family Show' at the [[2016 Kids' Choice Awards|29th Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref name=\"40thPeoplesChoice\" /><ref name=\"29thKidsChoice\" /> Wen was also named [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of April 12, 2015, for her performance in \"Melinda\", specifically her portrayal of May in the flashback sequences.<ref name=\"WenTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n===Grant Ward===\n{{main|Grant Ward (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\nGrant Douglas Ward (portrayed by [[Brett Dalton]]), the son of politicians, was abused by his parents and older brother Christian growing up. After attempting to kill Christian by burning their house down, Grant meets [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]], a Hydra double agent within S.H.I.E.L.D., who trains Grant to be a skilled agent. Later being assigned to Coulson's team, Grant is outed as Hydra when that organization is revealed to the world, and, after the death of Garrett, becomes a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D. In love with his former teammate Skye, Grant escapes custody, apparently kills Christian and their parents, and infiltrates Hydra so Skye can meet her father. Despite this, Skye turns on Ward and shoots him, and he escapes only with the help of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Kara Palamas, with whom he develops a romantic relationship. He accidentally kills Palamas while she is in disguise as May, and blaming S.H.I.E.L.D., decides to take over the now leader-less Hydra. Joining forces with one of Hydra's previous leaders, Gideon Malick, Ward travels through a portal to an alien planet in search of the ancient Inhuman [[Hive (comics)|Hive]], but is killed there by Coulson. This allows Hive to use Ward's body as a host.\n\nIn the Framework created by [[Holden Radcliffe]], he is Johnson's boyfriend and fellow Hydra agent. He is revealed to still be a double agent, now working for the Inhuman resistance, due to his recruitment by [[Victoria Hand]].\n\n[[File:Brett Dalton at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Brett Dalton]]\nDalton was cast in November 2012.<ref name=\"Dalton\" /> From the conception of the series it was decided that Grant Ward would be a traitor, with executive producer [[Jed Whedon]] saying \"since [the events of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' are] an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /><ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Ward's initial costumes were inspired by [[Jason Bourne]] and [[Ethan Hunt]], with his look based purely in function and with a muted color palette to reflect his serious attitude.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> After Ward was outed as Hydra and became a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D., Dalton grew a beard for the character, explaining that S.H.I.E.L.D. would not provide a prisoner with a razor, \"so it just happens to work out that I have a beard and beards can have a sort of evil connotation.\"<ref name=\"DaltonRebuilding\" /> Austin Lyon portrays a young Ward.<ref name=\"Lyon\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=I think what I was given was just a huge opportunity to play somebody who is more complex, more interesting, more dangerous, scarier in a way that Ward wasn\u2019t. I get to play two different characters in a way.|source=\u2014Dalton on being informed of his character's double agent status.<ref name=\"DaltonReveal\" />}}\nDalton has described Ward as he first appeared in the series as \"a guy who is very trustworthy and rolled up his sleeves and did all the heavy lifting and didn\u2019t really question authority. You know, a by-the-book risk assessor\". Although it was eventually revealed that Ward was a Hydra imposter, Dalton noted that that doesn't necessarily mean the relationships the character built with his S.H.I.E.L.D. team weren't genuine, since going undercover meant letting his guard down to make the other characters trust him, opening himself up to those relationships despite his ulterior motives.<ref name=\"DaltonReveal\" />\n\nFollowing the death of Garrett, the question was asked, \"Who is [Grant Ward] without someone telling him what to do?\" Dalton answered that \"he can follow commands really well. He can do and make tough choices and he can sometimes do unpleasant things in the name of something that he feels he believes in. But...I don\u2019t think that Ward knows the answer to that question himself.\" Dalton called the character a 'wildcard', since he was loyal to Garrett as a father figure rather than Hydra, \"and he was more about his teammates rather than the team\",<ref name=\"DaltonRebuilding\" /> later elaborating that \"It\u2019s not quite good guy, it\u2019s not quite bad guy. It\u2019s not trying to get in with S.H.I.E.L.D. again, it\u2019s not trying to get in with Hydra. He\u2019s really on his own path. He\u2019s living by his code at this particular point in life.\"<ref name=\"DaltonEWOct2014\" /> Explaining Ward's relationship with Palamas, Dalton stated <blockquote>When they first started this relationship, I thought they\u2019re two people who have experienced something similar by following orders and then finding themselves not knowing who they are when someone\u2019s not telling them what to do....But it really [has] developed into something that\u2019s much more complicated than that. There\u2019s a teacher-student relationship there as well as what seems like a genuinely romantic relationship. You see us really lovey-dovey in the cockpit and it\u2019s making everybody around us sick. In some ways, we have the most healthy relationship out of all of the other dynamics on the show, which is saying something because Ward is not a lovey-dovey kind of guy. That\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s now in probably the most stable relationship there is.<ref name=\"DaltonHalfDozen\" /></blockquote> When Ward accidentally kills Palamas in the season two finale, Dalton said that \"This affects him in a way that is deep and lasting. There was a shred of humanity in there, and always the possibility and the thought that he could be redeemed...After Kara\u2019s death\u2014that is actually at my hands\u2014after all the time and effort and energy that\u2019s been invested in this relationship, it turns him. You see it in his eyes....This whole thing of closure keeps coming up over and over again. There is so much closure out there in the world that needs to be achieved. There\u2019s a lot of unfairness that he wants to fix, so we see somebody who is determined, who knows who he is, and is like, 'Fine, if you want to call me the bad guy, I\u2019m the bad guy.'\"<ref name=\"DaltonS2Finale\" />\n\nSpeaking about the monologue Ward gives in \"[[Maveth]]\", Dalton noted that some viewers thought Ward sounded like \"a born-again, devout, off-my-rocker person at that point\", but Dalton felt that it was \"a real moment for Ward where he actually gets a sense of there's something greater than revenge and all of these smaller emotions; there's actually something that's bigger out there that he's a part of.\"<ref name=\"DaltonIGNMaveth\" /> Following Ward's death later in the episode, Bell discussed whether the writers ever considered redeeming the character, saying, \"No character is too high to fall or too low to be redeemed, theoretically....but for someone to be redeemed, they need to ask forgiveness, or want to be redeemed....[Ward] never felt like he needed to apologize for what he did.\"<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" /> Dalton returned to the series in the fourth season to portray Ward in the Framework.<ref name=\"DaltonS4\" /> Dalton felt returning to the character in this capacity allowed him to \"finally get to have the hero arc that Grant Ward deserves.\"<ref name=\"DaltonWonderCon2017\" />\n\nDalton won for 'Male Breakout Star' at the [[2014 Teen Choice Awards]].<ref name=\"2014TeenChoice\" /> The character of Grant Ward garnered a fan following, with a group known as the \"Ward Warriors\" often using the [[hashtag]] \"StandWithWard\" on social media. Dalton was surprised that people \"seem to be standing with Ward no matter what he does....there are people out there who just seem to be following this character wherever he goes. I think that\u2019s brilliant....There isn\u2019t any character like him on the show, and I would say even within the Marvel canon.\" As a \"shoutout\" to these fans, Palamas says, \"I will always stand with Ward\" in the second-season finale, which Dalton called \"a testament to the fans, this incredibly loyal fanbase that has now influenced the script of our show.\"<ref name=\"StandByWard\" />\n\n===Hive===\n{{further|Hive (comics)}}\nHive (from {{lang-la|Alveus}}) is one of the first Inhumans, a parasite who can connect with and control the minds of other Inhumans and feed off of or possess humans. Created by the Kree from a [[Mayan people|Mayan]] hunter (portrayed by Jason Glover) to lead their Inhuman army against mankind, Hive ultimately incited a rebellion, uniting humans and Inhumans to drive the Kree from Earth. Soon, a faction of Hive's followers who feared his power banished him through a portal to the planet Maveth, where he destroyed an entire civilization over centuries. He eventually only survived on human sacrifices sent through the portal by followers, and their descendants, still loyal to him\u2014Hydra. Hive escapes back through the portal in modern times by possessing the body of Grant Ward. He retains the memories of all the bodies he has inhabited, including now Hydra leader Gideon Malick's brother Nathaniel, and punishes Gideon for causing Nathaniel's sacrifice by murdering his daughter Stephanie, before taking control of Johnson, who Ward was in love with, and using her to kill Gideon. Hive then takes steps to recreate the original Kree experiment that made him, planning to use a warhead to spread a pathogen around the world and transform all humans into [[Inhumans#Alpha Primitives|Primitive Inhumans]]. He is destroyed when S.H.I.E.L.D. traps him in a quinjet with the warhead and detonates it in space.\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=What's so great about [Ward] is, he started off as one of the good guys, as one of the original team.

So there\u2019s still an aspect of the man we came to love to hate in there, but we wanted to give it some extra juice and we wanted to give Brett one more challenge where he has to change his character.\"<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" />\n\n[[File:Hive Agents of Shield.png|thumb|left|Hive's true form, as portrayed by Dalton through motion capture]]\nDalton aimed to emulate [[Meryl Streep]]'s character in ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', who never spoke above \"a conversational level...She didn't pound on her chest and make sure everybody knew that she's powerful, she just was.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHiveStreep\" /> Dalton also changed his voice to represent the memories of Will Daniels and Nathaniel Malick \"just a little bit. I tried to change my voice in there, I tried to change even my level of expression in there because I was supposed to be channeling somebody else entirely coming through.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHivePlans\" /><ref name=\"Hive318\" /> Dalton called the coat that Hive wears later in the third season \"iconic and timeless\", noting that \"fashion wasn't on the forefront of [Ward's] mind\", while Hive is more theatrical, \"colorful without having to do much.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHiveStreep\" />\n\nHive's ultimate goal is \"connection\", with Dalton saying, \"all these Inhumans have a purpose. Hive finds his purpose has to do with somehow connecting all of the Inhumans. What we see is Hive's attempt to fulfill what he thinks is his destiny...this desperate need to connect.<ref name=\"DaltonHiveDestiny\" /> Gregg called Hive \"the perfect villain for this show because he carries with him the memories, desire, hatreds and agendas of Will and of Grant Ward. At the same time, he\u2019s got a much deeper, bigger agenda that\u2019s thousands of years old, and gave birth to Hydra.\"<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" /> Dalton described him as a \"survivor\" who \"does not think small. This person has been around for way too long to think in anything other than global terms.\" He saw this as a fundamental difference between the character and Ward, who \"just becomes single minded and is hellbent on one thing at a time....Hive is the opposite. He sees every move on the chess board. That's what we're seeing in terms of Hive's thinking. It is about a new world order of sorts.\" On how much influence the memories of those whose bodies Hive inhabits have on the character, Dalton said, \"It's the motivations...you're seeing a flash of it. It's almost like seeing your kid. There are flashes of you in there...but then again, it's not me.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHivePlans\" />\n\nDalton realized that Hive would not be on the show for long when he took the part, with \"the big, big bad\" less likely to last as long as an \"anti-hero\" like Ward.<ref name=\"HiveDeathEW\" /> On Hive's final scene in the third-season finale, Dalton noted that there would have been no point in the character doing anything other than reflect: \"It's like looking into a fire. Somehow the truth comes out. You're looking at the Earth, man. It's so far away. And you'll get a perspective on things. For Hive, he was trying to change that entire thing and everyone who was on there....I think there's a great deal of remorse [that he was not] able to achieve that connection and do all the things that [he] wanted to do. But there was also an acceptance.\"<ref name=\"HiveDeathIGN\" />\n\n===Daisy \"Skye\" Johnson / Quake===\n{{further|Daisy Johnson}}\nDaisy Johnson (portrayed by [[Chloe Bennet]]) was born in China to [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Calvin Johnson]] and his [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] wife Jiaying, but was soon taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and raised as an orphan by nuns. Taking the name \"Skye\", she became a skilled [[hacktivist]], opposing organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D. This led to her involvement with Coulson, who decided to recruit her, and have Ward, and then May, train her to be a formidable field agent. After reuniting with her father, Skye chooses to drive him away, knowing him to be a monster and murderer, though his wishes for her to fulfill her destiny\u2014by unlocking her Inhuman abilities\u2014are granted when she unintentionally comes into contact with the [[Terrigen Mists]], which give her earthquake-generating abilities. Skye soon meets Jiaying, who helps Skye control her abilities. Skye's loyalties are tested when Jiaying attempts to start a war with S.H.I.E.L.D., and she ultimately sides with S.H.I.E.L.D. Now using her birth name, Johnson forms a S.H.I.E.L.D. team of Inhumans named the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]. After briefly being connected to Hive, and watching Lincoln Campbell, with whom she developed a romantic relationship, sacrifice himself for her, Johnson leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes known as the powered vigilante \"Quake\" to the public. She later returns to S.H.I.E.L.D. following the fight with Eli Morrow.\n\n[[File:Chloe Bennet by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chloe Bennet]]\nDaisy Johnson was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]] for ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #2.<ref name=\"DaisyCreators\" /> When the character of Skye was introduced to the series, it was always intended that she would be the MCU version of Johnson, as executive producer [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] explained, \"there are always the series of clearances, but we always knew we wanted to evolve Skye into something else. Daisy Johnson was the main character that we wanted to go for. We got confirmation on that very early on, so we\u2019ve been on that track ever since.\"<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> Bennet was cast as Skye in December 2012,<ref name=\"Dec2012Bennet\" /> out of more than 400 actresses who auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"Skye400\" /> Unlike the comic version, Skye is an Inhuman; Jed Whedon explained that \"We\u2019ve created a different origin for her...we merged those two ideas together also because there are such rabid fans out there that if we stick to original story points from the comics, they will smell story points from miles away. Those two factors led us to coming up with a different notion of how she got her powers.\"<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> During a [[Long take|single-shot]] fight sequence in \"[[The Dirty Half Dozen]]\", Bennet broke her arm and finished the second season without wearing a cast.<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" />\n\nSkye's initial costume design was intended to keep her relatable, with inspiration coming from [[street fashion|street style]] blogs,<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> but as she became a more experienced S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the second season, she received a more tactical outfit.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> For the third season, Bennet cut her hair to further her character's transformation to Daisy Johnson, as she is portrayed in the comics, though she did not cut her hair as short as her comic counterpart; Bennet explained that \"the comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, [[Miley Cyrus]]-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair.\"<ref name=\"BennetHair\" /> Bennet also received a superhero costume for the third season, again bringing the character closer to the version in the comics.<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> Foley felt that \"one of the most important things was that the symbol be incorporated into her costume but especially onto the gauntlets, And it\u2019s also on the back of her suit, which was a fun little touch that we added. As far as the silhouette, we wanted to stay true to the comics and pay tribute to those original designs. I also wanted to incorporate the gold color that I\u2019ve seen in some of the illustrations of her suit throughout the comics, which is why we have the gold lines that we see on the suit. Finally, for me personally, I wanted a nod to her tactical look from last season, so if you look at the style lines around the top of the costume, you will see that they\u2019re similar to her tactical hood from Season 2.\" The suit was \"made out of printed EuroJersey, which works well for these costumes because it\u2019s a four-way stretch that gives Chloe the ability to move and do her stunts... But there is a lot more leather in her suit than in some of the others.\" [[Legacy Effects]] created Johnson's iconic gauntlets from the comics, making them \"out of flexible materials painted to look like metal\" so as not to injure anyone during stunts.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" />\n\nBennet, talking about Skye's commitment to S.H.I.E.L.D., stated that \"I think at the beginning she came into S.H.I.E.L.D. thinking it was this government-run, CIA-type thing, where they\u2019re not for the people and their motives were not good ones. But throughout the [first] season, being on the team and seeing what was happening, she really got to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. is there. It really is to protect people, and the intention behind the organization is pure....I think she finds a parallel between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Coulson, and I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s committed to it so deeply.\" Elaborating on this, Bennet said \"she\u2019s always had this unspoken bond with Coulson that\u2019s a very father/daughter relationship where clearly the love they have for each other is evident in a very caring way.\"\n\nGoing into the second season, Bennet noted on the character, \"I think she\u2019s always someone who will wear her heart on her sleeve, but I think she\u2019s much smarter about it now, if that makes any sense. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the type of person who can halfass anything, and that includes emotions. If she feels something, she feels something. But she knows how to control it more\".<ref name=\"BennetRebuilding\" /> Talking about the changes to the character after it was revealed that she was Daisy Johnson and an Inhuman, Tancharoen said \"With this discovery will come some consequences, especially in her relationships with everyone around her, specifically Coulson...Needless to say, it\u2019s going to be a very complex, emotional journey for her. We have the ability on a television show to really explore the emotional journey of that. What does that mean now that she has this ability? Does she even want it?\"<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> Explaining some of these changes in the character, Bennet stated that \"I make sure to try to keep the season one Daisy weaved through the new, badass Daisy....[but] she's changed a lot. She went into S.H.I.E.L.D. hating organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., and now she's the epitome of S.H.I.E.L.D. She believes in everything that they believe in.\"<ref name=\"BennetSep2015\" />\n\nDiscussing the character becoming leader of the Secret Warriors, Bennet said, \"What makes her such a good leader is how much she's been through, so she can relate to everyone on the team and she really has so much empathy and that's what I love about playing her. She really genuinely cares about everyone so deeply and it wears heavily on her because she obviously went through this big Inhuman change...And so what I think makes her such a good kind of...unconventional leader is that she's really kind of still learning and I think that's so realistic that leaders are\u2014it's almost like when you grow up and you realize that your parents are just humans, parenting.\" Wen noted how the character \"has evolved from being so anti-establishment into suddenly being someone who wants to create an establishment that would help and enhance the betterment of the world\", to which Bennet said, \"she was lost for a really long time, she was an orphan and she wanted to find her parents and all of a sudden she does and it's not what she expected. You know, when your mom tries to kill you and your dad is Hyde. So she's kind of grown into this.\"<ref name=\"CBRTakingCharge\" />\n\nEntering the fourth season, Bennet felt that, after the events of the final episode of season three, Johnson was \"in a darker place. She's mourning. She cares about the team so much that she feels like she is protecting them by kind of pushing them away, because I think she feel like everything bad happens around her and she can't help but cause problems. Her way of taking care of the people she cares about is kind of pushing them away, which... is not the best thing.\" She also added that physically, Johnson would not be in great shape, since she is no longer under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s monitoring \"containing and helping me grow my powers\" so there would be \"repercussions of her kind of using these powers and... abusing her body\".<ref name=\"BennetCBRJul2016\" />\n\nBennet received nominations for 'Favorite TV Actress' and 'Favorite Female TV Star \u2013 Family Show' at the [[2015 Kids' Choice Awards|28th]] and [[2016 Kids' Choice Awards|29th Kids' Choice Awards]], respectively.<ref name=\"29thKidsChoice\" /><ref name=\"28thKidsChoice\" />\n\n===Leo Fitz===\n{{main|Leo Fitz}}\nLeopold \"Leo\" James Fitz (portrayed by [[Iain De Caestecker]]) is brought on to Coulson's team as an engineering and weapons technology specialist, and provides tech support for the team throughout the first season. He has a close bond with Agent Simmons, the two having graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy together. At the end of the first season he confesses to Simmons that he has romantic feelings towards her, before nearly dying in an attempt to save her. Left with severe brain damage, Fitz struggles with technology and speech, but over time becomes a full member of the team again. When his consciousness is submerged in the Framework, Fitz becomes \"The Doctor\", Hydra's remorseless second-in-command, and has a relationship with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]]. The experience changes him; retaining his memories of this other life, he is haunted by his past actions. During the final battle against a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, Fitz is buried under a rubble and was found fatally injured when dug out by May and Mack where he succumbs to his wounds. As Daisy and Simmons lead the search for Fitz, Enoch releases Fitz prematurely when they come under attack. Making their way to the planet Kitson, the two of them work to afford a ride off the planet until the casino comes under attack by the Chronicom hunters. Even though Fitz and Simmons reunite, Malachi makes off with Fitz. In order to keep Malachi from killing Fitz, Simmons surrenders herself to Altarah so that the two of them can come up with a time-traveling method to help the Chronicoms go back in time to prevent Chronyca-2's destruction. When the Lighthouse was attacked, Fitz and Simmons were saved by Enoch in Isaiah's body.\n\n[[File:Iain De Caestecker at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Iain De Caestecker]]\nDe Caestecker was cast as Fitz in November 2012.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> Following injuries the character receives at the end of the first season, the series began to deal with brain trauma, as De Caestecker explained \"From the get-go, before I even knew about it, the writers had the idea, and they did a lot of research in it with doctors. When I found out about it, I did my own research and correlated it together. It's just something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing to a lot of people, brain trauma, so we just have to constantly be respectful towards it. We talk about it all the time. Even if you don't see it or it's not obvious, it's always something that's in our heads that we're keeping going. It's the realization that you never get fully better, it's about embracing the new side of you and making that work in the world that you're in. I suppose the idea of a cure\u2014I don't know if that could happen.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2\" /> For Fitz's costume design, Foley tried to have his clothes reflect his personality, without \"getting too clich\u00e9...we try and play up his \"heritage style\"...using classic design details on him like paisley & leather elbow patches and mixing them with different plaids.\"<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" />\n\nDe Caestecker, in describing the character, said that \"Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He\u2019s quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where\u2014I don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn\u2019t really understand emotions as much\".<ref name=\"CaesteckerOnSet\" /> Fitz has a lot of interaction with Simmons in the series, with De Caestecker explaining \"My character, he\u2019s Engineering, so he\u2019s on the computer and tech side of everything. He\u2019s consumed within that world, and he works very closely with Simmons, who\u2019s Biochem. They\u2019ve got this kind of weird chemistry together, and they just kind of fit each other in a very weird way.\"<ref name=\"CaesteckerIGN\" /> Regarding the changing dynamic over time between Fitz and Simmons, De Caestecker said \"I suppose what's happened from the start of season two up to midseason is, they've become a lot stronger as individuals, I think. But I think they still care for and need each other a lot, and they also work better together when they are together. But I think there's a lot of things that have still been unsaid and will hopefully come out, certain confrontations that are still bubbling under.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2\" />\n\nDe Caestecker was named [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of September 27, 2015, for his performance in \"[[Laws of Nature (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Laws of Nature]]\", particularly the episode's final scene.<ref name=\"DeCaesteckerTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n=== Jemma Simmons ===\n{{Main|Jemma Simmons}}\nJemma Anne Simmons (portrayed by [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]) is brought on to Coulson's team as a life sciences (both human and alien) specialist, and has a close bond with Agent Fitz, the two having graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy together. She grows to mistrust all things alien and superhuman, but shows her loyalty to Coulson despite this when they are faced with the rival S.H.I.E.L.D. faction. Following the fight against the Inhumans, Simmons is absorbed by the [[Kree]] monolith, a portal to the alien planet Maveth. There she falls in love with Will Daniels, who sacrifices himself so she can return to Earth. Simmons eventually moves on from Daniels and begins a relationship with Fitz. After Fitz was killed, Simmons partook in the mission to find the preserved body that Enoch had. Even though Fitz and Simmons reunite, Malachi makes off with Fitz. In order to keep Malachi from killing Fitz, Simmons surrenders herself to Altarah so that the two of them can come up with a time-traveling method to help the Chronicoms go back in time to prevent Chronyca-2's destruction. When the Lighthouse was attacked, Fitz and Simmons were saved by Enoch in Isaiah's body. Simmons then uses the same pod to save May's life as she has the Di'Allis samples taken and the temple destroyed. After a jump, the Zephyr arrives at the top of the Empire State Building where she mentions that the Chronicoms wanted to establish Chronyca-3 and also reveals that Enoch used a combination of Life Model Decoy technology and Chronicom technology to create an advanced LMD of Phil Coulson.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Henstridge - PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Elizabeth Henstridge]]\nHenstridge was also cast in November 2012.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> She described her character as \"a biochem expert. She\u2019s young and hungry and she\u2019s a great woman to play because she\u2019s intelligent and focused and curious and she doesn\u2019t apologize for it. She\u2019s got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeCrave\" /> After the reveal during the [[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|season two premiere]] that Fitz was just imagining Simmons in the episode, Henstridge explained that the showrunners \"tell you what you need to know to act your scenes, but anything after that, you never know.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeHydra\" /> For Simmons' costume design, Foley tried to have her clothes reflect her personality, without \"getting too clich\u00e9...we mix the hard with the soft\u2014we combine the feminine elements like peter pan collars, silk blouses and florals with the masculine touches like ties\".<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> Ava Marielle portrays a younger Simmons.\n\nHenstridge talked about the characters of Fitz and Simmons being separated over the course of the series, noting that they have \"never been without each other. When you see them without each other, that brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters in discovering what it's like to have to be independent\".<ref name=\"HenstridgeTVGuide\" /> On Simmons' guilt over Fitz's brain damage, Henstridge said \"She feels a huge amount of guilt. There\u2019s a lot of emotions happening. A lot of it revolves around Fitz and Ward. She feels a lot of anger and resentment at the situation. When something catastrophic happens to someone you love, or a situation arises that affects people you love the most, if that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in that position, you never really know what to do.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeHydra\" /> As this relationship developed through the second season, Henstridge said, \"I don't think they fully realize the implication of how far apart they are. There's so much hurt there. I don't think they realize what they're sacrificing by not figuring this out.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> Talking about the harsher side of Simmons seen later in the second season, after the reveal of the Inhumans and the subsequent death of Agent Triplett, Henstridge explained that at the beginning of the series, Simmons was \"very mathematical\" but throughout the first season \"understood that it was more about human relationships and what it means to save someone's life\". Now, \"she's had a traumatic event and she's gone straight back to what she knows of trying to make everything black and white\", and so \"It makes sense [to her] if there are these people\u2014call them what you want; Inhumans\u2014that cause destruction, and you can get rid of them, then they won't be {{sic|a destruction}} anymore....Of course it isn't\" that simple.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" />\n\nAfter Simmons is trapped on the planet Maveth for six months, she becomes \"profoundly different\", with Henstridge describing her as \"definitely still her essence\u2014she doesn\u2019t just completely change. But she\u2019s been through so much. She\u2019s hardened. She\u2019s had to face things that she never would\u2019ve imagined, also by herself without Fitz, so she\u2019s definitely changed, stronger and kind of damaged.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsEW301\" /> Describing the relationship that Simmons develops with Daniels on the planet, and comparing it to that with Fitz, Henstridge said, \"It's very visceral. It's more primal and intense. That just comes from having to survive in a hostile environment, only having each other on the whole planet. The stakes are always so high, so it's more physical than her relationship with Fitz. FitzSimmons is a slow burn that's taken years and years, and they connected over intellect, whereas her and Will, it's an \"us against the world\" kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsTHR305\" /> After Daniels dies and Simmons eventually moves on with Fitz, the latter two are shown consummating their relationship after several seasons worth of build up. \"We imagine they spend the morning after laughing a lot about what just happened,\" said Whedon and Tancharoen, \"We want their relationship to feel like their friendship did, because all the best relationships are just that. So moving forward, while this change in their friendship would hopefully only deepen their connection, it is bound also to make things a bit more complicated.\"<ref name=\"FitzSimmonsSex\" />\n\nHenstridge was named [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of October 25, 2015, for her performance in \"[[4,722 Hours]]\", particularly for carrying the episode herself.<ref name=\"HenstridgeTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n===Lance Hunter===\n{{further|Lance Hunter}}\nLance Hunter (portrayed by [[Nick Blood]]), an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] lieutenant turned mercenary, joins post-Hydra S.H.I.E.L.D. at the request of Coulson following a recommendation from his ex-wife [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]]. Despite a tumultuous relationship with Morse, Hunter becomes a full-time S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, and risks his life to save her when she is kidnapped. Following an incident in Russia involving the near-assassination of Prime Minister Olshenko, Hunter and Morse decide to disavow themselves from S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect Coulson and the team. Hunter continues doing mercenary work, with Fitz eventually reaching out for Hunter to free him from General Hale's base while posing as a lawyer.

Generally I think they\u2019re slightly wary, a little bit suspicious, [but also] a little bit amused by him. Because the nice thing about him coming into this group is that Lance doesn\u2019t really care that much of what people think of him. So he\u2019s very much himself and very comfortable in it. He doesn\u2019t bow down to the etiquette of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy.\"<ref name=\"BloodSep2014\" />\n\nTalking about Hunter's integration into the team following an offer from Coulson to become a full-time agent, Blood said, \"I feel Hunter probably feels very independent, still, so I don't think he would like to admit that he's not an outsider, that he's a part of it....He doesn't have too much respect for authority and titles, particularly in this world, but I think he takes each decision as it comes. If Coulson does something he respects, that's all good. If he doesn't, he's going to say something. But I think he sees that [Coulson is] trying to do the right thing, and he's got a lot of respect for him in that sense\". Also, on Hunter's on-again, off-again relationship with Morse, Blood said, \"I think the dynamic's great. I think it's really good and there is a lot of truth in it of those relationships you have where it's kind of, \"can't live with each other, can't kill each other,\" and that sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"BloodPalickiRocky\" /> After Hunter kills a man in \"[[A Wanted (Inhu)man]]\", Blood said, \"I think that\u2019s probably newer for the audience than it is for Hunter. I think Hunter, in his past, has probably done some morally questionable acts....not to say he\u2019s ever been a vicious, vindictive, or immoral person.

He doesn\u2019t necessarily have access to all the bells-and-whistles and gadgetry that S.H.I.E.L.D. did, so he has to use his charm and his wit to break down doors, and call in a few favors from his dodgy friends\".<ref name=\"BloodTVLine\" />\n\n===Bobbi Morse===\n{{further|Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)}}\nBarbara \"Bobbi\" Morse (portrayed by [[Adrianne Palicki]]) is Hunter's ex-wife and an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. A founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" after disobeying Fury's orders to save hundreds of S.H.I.E.L.D. lives, she infiltrates Coulson's group for reconnaissance. Coulson sends her undercover within Hydra, where she gave up the location of Agent 33 rather than risk the lives of many other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. She later agrees, along with her fellow \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" leaders, to combine their faction with Coulson's. Ward then kidnaps her in an attempt to force her to confess to giving up 33 to Hydra, but when Morse is unrepentant, Ward sets a trap for Hunter which will see him killed in front of her. Morse takes the bullet for Hunter, barely surviving.

It had to have a kind of tactical feeling to it too so that it made sense in our universe. She's got rivets that are in the straps across her chest, and those are there as a tribute to the buttons that go down the side of her [most recent comics] costume\". The character's comics costume is traditionally navy blue and white, which was changed to navy blue and grey for the series.<ref name=\"MockingbirdCostumeMarvel\" /> Three sets of the costume were produced; two for Palicki to wear, and one for her stunt double. Foley used \"lots of stretch panels\" and leather to ensure freedom of movement in the character's many action sequences.<ref name=\"MockingbirdCostumeFashionista\" />\n\nWith the reveal of Morse's loyalty to the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction, Palicki explained that the character was \"not doing anything wrong in her [own] eyes...This was a choice she made. She\u2019s been through hell with these people. She does care about Coulson\u2019s team. She\u2019s torn because of Hunter and she has a soft spot for Coulson. But at the end of it, she really is a true soldier and she feels there has been a compromise and she needs to take care of it.\"<ref name=\"PalickiEWrS\" /> Bell, in response to a question on whether Morse had more secrets than those revealed during the second season, stated that \"she and Hunter have been keeping secrets from one another, evidently for years. And one of the things I find interesting about her is she seems to be more of an ideologue\u2014she\u2019s loyal to an idea\u2014and sometimes, the short term of what appears to be betrayal or short term conflict is often because of what she views as the greater good. And that\u2019s an interesting character to have in a world where Coulson is much more \"we need to protect or save that person.\" Are you loyal to a person? Are you loyal to the guy in the bunker next to you? Or are you loyal to the larger concept of what we\u2019re fighting for?\"<ref name=\"MockingbirdPoster\" />\n\nWhen asked about her character potentially appearing in an MCU film, Palicki said \"that was one of the things that was discussed when I was coming on for the part, and you know, we\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s such a nice world that we live in that crossover can happen so often now which in the past it never really did so, to see these worlds come together on the small screen and the big screen is really cool.\"<ref name=\"PalickiCrossover\" /> Palicki left the series following the season three episode \"Parting Shot\" to star in the spin-off show ''Marvel's Most Wanted''.<ref name=\"BellPartingShot\" />\n\nPalicki was named as an honorable mention for [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of March 20, 2016, for her performance in \"Parting Shot\".<ref name=\"PalickiTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n===Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie===\n{{further|Al MacKenzie}}\nAlphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie (portrayed by [[Henry Simmons]]), a S.H.I.E.L.D. mechanic under Robert Gonzales, is a founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and infiltrates Coulson's group with Morse. After being briefly mind-controlled by Kree technology Mack's distrust in alien and the superhuman is deepened, and he decides to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. when his fellow leaders agree to join forces with Coulson. However, following the war with the Inhumans, Coulson convinces Mack to stay, and places him in charge of all alien materials. Coulson makes Mack acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he goes after Ward and Hydra. In the Framework, Mack's daughter Hope is still alive. After being used by Hydra to reveal Johnson is from the real world, he seeks out the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance to help them. When the exit point from the Framework is found, Mack chooses to stay behind, saying that the time he spent with the Framework version of Hope was real enough for him. He later leaves the Framework when Hope disappears amongst the Framework's collapse. After the death of Coulson, Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n[[File:Henry Simmons by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Simmons]]\nIn August 2014, Simmons joined the cast as Mack, a recurring character inspired by one that first appeared in ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3.<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the third season.<ref name=\"SimmonsRegular\" />\n\nSimmons described Mack as \"a big guy. That is, he has a big heart, but when it comes down to it and business has to get done, there\u2019s another side of him that gets it done....He wants to make a difference, so that\u2019s why he wants to be a part of this team\". On the different dynamic that a mechanic brings to the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, Simmons said \"I think my guy does have a little bit of a different element, [because] the other people have the stress of the everyday life or death danger situations. Mack doesn\u2019t have that quite yet. He has the stress of getting things done because he wants to contribute, but he\u2019s not out there in the field....They might have their quips and everything, but everything is very serious. I see that my guy brings a little bit of a different color to everything. He has a little bit more humor to him, he\u2019s a little bit more laid back.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsRebuilding\" /> On Mack's stance on violence, Simmons confirmed that \"Mack really is a guy that does not like violence at all, but, when pushed, it\u2019s \"by any means necessary.\" He doesn't enjoy it, but he'll do what he has to do.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsrS\" />\n\nAfter Mack's allegiance to the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction is revealed, and as his distrust of Coulson grew throughout the second season, Simmons spoke of Mack's feelings towards Coulson: \"He respects Coulson. And I think he genuinely likes Coulson. But I think he just believes that Coulson is not the right man for the job....look, I\u2019m loyal, but if the head is going about doing things that really aren\u2019t in our job description, and he\u2019s using us to do things for personal reasons, and then one of my brothers dies because of it? Yeah, I have a problem. And everyone else should, too....when Coulson is in his most crazed state and on the verge of killing Sebastian Derik, no one has ever seen Coulson like that. Skye witnessed it, but she has a different relationship to him; there\u2019s like a father/daughter thing going. So out of the whole team, I was the only one to see him like that, completely out of control. I tried to explain it to Hunter\u2014if that happened in that instant, what\u2019s going to happen when everything is on the line? How is he going to act?\u2014and Hunter kind of brushed it aside. But that\u2019s another reason why Mack is very, very deeply skeptical.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsrS\" />\n\nIn season six, Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Simmons \"love[d] the challenge of being the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" but felt \"the one thing that can hinder Mack\u2019s ability to lead is his reluctance to put the people he loves in the line of danger,\" which leads to \"Mack\u2019s toughest decision as director.\"<ref name=\"MackDirectorS6\" />\n\n===Lincoln Campbell===\nLincoln Campbell (portrayed by [[Luke Mitchell]]) is an Inhuman doctor with the ability to control electric charges. He helps Skye adjust to her new life post-terrigenesis, and his later attempt to protect her from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra leads to his capture and experimentation at the hands of Dr. List. Skye saves his life, and when she turns on Jiaying once realizing her true intentions, Campbell is shortly convinced to do the same. Following Jiaying's death, Campbell attempts to live a normal life, convinced that his Inhuman abilities are a curse, but is hunted by the ATCU and becomes a fugitive. He subsequently joins S.H.I.E.L.D. for protection and to be near Skye\u2014now going by Daisy Johnson and with whom Campbell forms a relationship\u2014and becomes a Secret Warrior. Campbell chooses to sacrifice himself to save the team and the world from Hive's plan by taking Hive and a nuclear warhead to space in a quinjet where the weapon can detonate without affecting Earth.\n\nDaisy mentioned that Lincoln has a sister named Amanda who Daisy sends relief money to.\n\n[[File:Luke Mitchell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Luke Mitchell]]\nMitchell was introduced as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring character, in the second season.<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the third season.<ref name=\"MitchellRegular\" /> Regarding the character's introduction, Bell stated that \"Meeting Luke\u2019s character in the Inhuman world is just setting up a new dynamic. We\u2019re taking Skye into a group with a whole bunch of different people. So far, we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a guy with no eyes, and there\u2019s a woman who now is covered in thorns. And as in the [[X-Men]] world, there are a handful of people who look more like them, but a lot of them turn out to be just attractive people with powers. And we thought, \"Hey, let\u2019s have some of those as well!\" We were looking for a new character to come on, and Luke just really impressed us. He was a good actor, had a nice quality, and we felt he might be a good person to sort of usher Skye into this other world.\"<ref name=\"AfterlifePoster\" />\n\nHeading into season three, Mitchell explained that \"the Lincoln that the audience was introduced to in season two was a side of Lincoln, and that side of Lincoln was not necessarily a lie or the truth or whatever, but we all put on different faces in different environments...I think in that environment Lincoln was very much under the spell of the Inhuman Elders. He played his part in the hierarchy there and he believed in the cause, which then was exposed to be evil. Then in season three, it\u2019s like, wow, how is he dealing with the events in season two?\"<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> On seeing Lincoln's darker side in the third season, Mitchell said, \"I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more of Lincoln\u2019s issues with his past pop up, in particular possibly some anger issues that have been unresolved. They pop their heads up from time to time. Certainly in matters of conflict, in pressure situations\".<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" />\n\nOn the relationship that Campbell develops with Johnson, the only person who can \"keep him somewhat in check when it comes to his anger\", Mitchell said, \"he wants to make something of his life, but he doesn\u2019t see anything without Daisy in the picture\", and \"if something were to happen to Daisy, I think Lincoln wouldn\u2019t stay in S.H.I.E.L.D. Daisy is his life. He\u2019ll do anything to get her back.\" This is seen when he agrees to wear a \"murder vest\" as a fail safe, and when he disobeys orders to test an experimental antitoxin on himself\u2014\"Once he does that, and it doesn\u2019t work, then they put him in the containment module for his own benefit, because his immune system is done. It becomes incredibly frustrating.\" Mitchell added, \"He makes these decisions, but you still see the fear in him when he does this. It\u2019s not just bravado....There\u2019s a deep well of emotion in him.\"<ref name=\"MitchellDeathWish\" />\n\nThe episode \"[[Bouncing Back]]\" opens with \"a mysterious flash-forward to three months in the future, showing an unidentified S.H.I.E.L.D. agent seemingly dead in space\",<ref name=\"FlashForward\" /> leading to a \"four-episode event\" for the final episodes of the season, marketed as ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent''.<ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> A poster created by [[Greg Land]] for the event recreated the cover of the \"iconic\" ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #121 that served as the first issue of the story arc \"[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]\",<ref name=\"ASM121Poster\" /> and ahead of the season finale, Marvel released a series of videos that \"memorialized\" each of the potential character who could have been the Fallen Agent.<ref name=\"MemorialVideos\" /> The final episode of the season reveals that it is Campbell who dies, which the executive producers had known going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward.<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" /> Bell said he \"earned it\", adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon explaining that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not \"want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there\u2019s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn\u2019t consider himself a hero. That\u2019s the beauty of the moment\u2014it\u2019s not just for [Daisy], but it is, and it\u2019s not just for him, but it is.\"<ref name=\"EWEPsMay2016\" />\n\n===Holden Radcliffe===\n{{further|Holden Radcliffe}}\n[[File:John Hannah by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Hannah]]\nHolden Radcliffe (portrayed by [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]]) is a transhumanist who believes in the improvement of humanity through enhancement.

After a S.H.I.E.L.D. raid on Hive's base, Radcliffe escapes and agrees to cooperate with Coulson and Talbot. After being acquitted, Radcliffe transfers his [[artificial intelligence]] [[AIDA (comics)|AIDA]] into a [[Life Model Decoy]] (LMD), an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project, which Radcliffe also names Aida. After seeing pages from the ''Darkhold'', Radcliffe begins using his LMDs, including Aida and a decoy of May, to try and take it for himself in an attempt to learn the secret to eternal life. Fearing for his safety, Radcliffe also creates a decoy of himself, and seeks protection from the Watchdogs. Using the ''Darkhold'' and the resources of the Watchdogs' Superior, Racliffe creates an entire digital world within the Framework. Feeling that Radcliffe may one day jeopardize the Framework himself, Aida slits Radcliffe's wrists and uploads his mind to the Framework as his body dies. Within the Framework, his consciousness resided on Ogygia with Agnes in exchange for not interfering with Aida's work as Madame Hydra. After redeeming himself, Holden is deleted amongst the Framework's collapse.\n\nHannah recurred as Radcliffe during the end of the third season,<ref name=\"318Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"Radcliffe\" /> before being promoted to the main cast for the fourth season.<ref name=\"HannahRegular\" /> On Radcliffe transferring his [[artificial intelligence]] AIDA into a Life Model Decoy,<ref name=\"LMD\" /> Whedon said, \"Radcliffe has a good heart, but he's willing to do anything for science. He's excited about the prospect. He said Fitz and Simmons had friends die and maybe they didn't have to. He's clearly opening a box. Whether or not it's Pandora's box, we'll see. He thinks there's something beyond humans.\" Tancharoen added, \"To someone like Radcliffe, he might believe that to be just the next step in human evolution. There are a number of people who are into body modification now, so what does that mean? What's the root of that?\"<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" />\n\nHannah felt portraying Radcliffe was \"quite interesting\", describing him as \"someone who is not the up-down, white-hearted good guy\" but still is not \"a bad guy\". He also noted the fatherly feelings Radcliffe has towards Aida, stating, \"possibly as [their relationship] develops, as she proves there\u2019s almost a paternal... caring and sympathetic way in which that technology has developed self-awareness and how that self-awareness disappoints. A bit like you would with a child, where a child becomes aware of their own limitations, their own lackings. I would say there\u2019s certainly have a very benign kind of deity sense about it \u2013 a benign\u2026not dictatorship about it, but a benign parental way about it.\"<ref name=\"HannahCBRJan2017\" />\n\n===Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez===\n{{further|Yo-Yo Rodriguez}}\n[[File:Natalia Cordova-Buckley by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Natalia Cordova-Buckley]]\nElena Rodriguez (portrayed by [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]]) is a Colombian Inhuman who can move at a super speed for a beat of her heart, before returning to the point she started moving from. She comes into contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. when they investigate her for stealing weapons from the corrupt members of the local police. She grows close to Mack, who nicknames her \"Yo-Yo\", and eventually agrees to join the Secret Warriors. After the signing of the Sokovia Accords, Rodriguez returns to her life with occasional monitoring by S.H.I.E.L.D. Rodriguez later helps Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons to infiltrate the Framework. After Johnson and Simmons are unable to rescue Mack from the Framework, Rodriguez goes in to rescue him.\n\nBy February 2016, Cordova-Buckley was cast as \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez, based on the comic Secret Warrior of the same name.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckley\" /> Cordova-Buckley learned of the role after she had been cast in the series, and subsequently researched the comics for inspiration. She described the character, as she is initially introduced in the series, as a freedom fighter who \"in a lot of ways she wants to help her people in Colombia and she wants to do good with her powers and she makes sure that she\u2019s very adamant on how she goes about things.\" She also noted the rarity of the character's spirituality, saying that she \"has this whole spiritual connection to her powers which is rare to ever see in a super hero movie...She wants to use [her powers] as what she calls a blessing and a gift from God to help others, so it\u2019s a very unique approach to it all\".<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyLatina\" /> When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character.<ref name=\"ThisWeek47\" /> Before the start of the fifth season, it was revealed that Cordova-Buckley had been promoted to series regular.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyMain\" />\n\n===Deke Shaw===\n[[File:Jeff Ward by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeff Ward]]\nDeke Shaw (portrayed by [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]]) is \"the ultimate survivor\" and a \"roguish scavenger\" on the space station Lighthouse in the year 2091. With a sharp mind and quick wit, he has the ability to acquire items for a price.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> During the final battle with Kasius, Enoch and Deke sacrifice their lives to get Phil Coulson's team back to their own time. However, Deke is revealed to have been sent to the present with Coulson and his team and is found and rescued from jail by Daisy under the alias of Sinara Smith. Deke later realizes that he is the grandson of Fitz and Simmons, eventually telling the latter. When a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot was defeated by Daisy, Simmons was unable to find Deke in his room.\n\nIn season six, it's revealed that Deke left S.H.I.E.L.D. to start a [[Technology company|tech company]] that involved using the Framework for a virtual reality video game as well as \"borrowing\" S.H.I.E.L.D. tech to make new innovations. Despite this, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept tabs on him via Agent Trevor Khan, who worked undercover as his partner. He was targeted by Sarge's group, who mistook him for a Shrike carrier due to his strange readings before he was rescued by Mack and May. While helping the S.H.I.E.L.D. team thwart Sarge's plan to nuke Izel's shrikes, Deke fell in love with the latter's associate Snowflake after Sarge abandoned her for the sake of his revenge.\n\nWard was cast in August 2017;<ref name=\"JeffWardCast\" /> his role was announced in November 2017.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> Ward had originally been cast as Virgil, a character who dies in the first episode. During the [[Read-through|table read]] of the episode, the main cast felt Ward \"nailed it\" as Virgil and wanted him to stay on as Deke, who had not yet been cast. The producers reached out to Ward after the reading to audition for Deke, and was ultimately cast in the part.<ref name=\"WardOriginallyVirgil\" />\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2018, it was revealed that Ward had been promoted to a series regular for the sixth season.<ref name=\"WardSeriesRegular\" />\n\n==Recurring characters==\nThe following is a list of guest characters that have recurring roles throughout the series. The characters are listed by the MCU media or season in which they first appeared.\n\n===Introduced in films===\n====Gideon Malick====\nGideon Malick (portrayed by [[Powers Boothe]]) is a former member of the World Security Council and secret leader of Hydra who ascended to power following the death of his father in 1970. Gideon was joined by his brother Nathaniel, but the two soon learned of a trick their father used to avoid being sacrificed to Hive, and when Gideon followed suit, Nathaniel was sacrificed. Gideon successfully opens the portal to allow Hive to return to Earth, but Hive reveals that he has retained Nathaniel's memories, and punishes Gideon by murdering his daughter Stephanie. After being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., Gideon cooperates with Coulson against Hive. Gideon is murdered by Johnson while she is controlled by Hive.\n\nIn October 2015, it was announced that Boothe was joining the series as a recurring character early in the third season, reprising his role from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (where he was credited only as \"World Security Council\").<ref name=\"Boothe\" /><ref name=\"Boothe2\" /> On how much the series would use the character later in the third season, following the midseason finale, Whedon stated that \"we\u2019d be fools not to use him more. We couldn\u2019t be bigger fans of [Boothe's] portrayal of the role. We knew going in that we were going to get some bang for our buck, and we\u2019ve been loving writing the character. We love the way he\u2019s attacking the scenes. We plan on keeping him around, because we\u2019d be idiots not to.\"<ref name=\"WhedonEWDec2015\" /> [[Cameron Palatas]] portrays a young Gideon Malick.<ref name=\"316Synopsis\" />\n\n===Introduced in season one===\n====Mike Peterson / Deathlok====\n{{further|Deathlok|Mike Peterson (comics)}}\nMike Peterson (portrayed by [[J. August Richards]]) is an ordinary man that was artificially enhanced with the [[Extremis]]-containing Centipede serum by Project Centipede. Peterson later joins S.H.I.E.L.D, but is caught in an explosion and awakens without his right leg and under the control of the \"Clairvoyant\", who gives him a bionic prosthetic limb as part of \"Project Deathlok\". After the defeat of Centipede and the \"Clairvoyant\", Peterson works for Coulson covertly, and aids in the take down of Hydra leader Dr. List. Peterson later returned with some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to help Phil Coulson seal the rift in the Lighthouse that was leaking different fears from it. Afterwards, he attended Fitz and Simmons' wedding.\n\nRichards appeared in Joss Whedon's ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' as [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]] before being cast as Peterson,<ref name=\"RichardsSFX\" /> who was revealed to be the MCU version of Deathlok in January 2014.<ref name=\"DeathlokConfirmed\" /> Created by [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Doug Moench]] in 1974, Deathlok has gone through many different iterations in the comics.<ref name=\"DeathlokComics\" /> Richards called the role \"a dream come true\",<ref name=\"RichardsSFX\" /> and described the character's costume and makeup, which took \"about five departments...two hours to do the makeup and then [about] 15 or 20 minutes to get into the costume\", as \"restrictive. I love the costume and it really helps me to play the character, because it makes me feel part-machine, part-human.\"<ref name=\"RichardsHitFix\" /> The costume also had to be enhanced with visual effects, including the addition of a robotic leg and an arm mounted rocket launcher, as well as a half metal plated skull with robotic eye for when Deathlok is seen with x-ray vision.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> The costume was updated and evolved to be closer to the comic version for Deathlok's appearance in the second season.<ref name=\"RichardsIGNS2\" />\n\nRichards found \"the theme of Deathlok [to be] about deep, internal conflict, and that's what we're bringing with this [version].\"<ref name=\"RichardsMarvel\" /> After returning late in the second season, Richards looked back, and felt that his initial awkwardness and reluctance with the character and the costume reflected Peterson's own journey becoming Deathlok. He also noted that when the character says \"Mike Peterson is dead\", \"the only way that line could have meaning [is] if it were not true. I always think of Mike Peterson being at the core of this character, and whatever happens as a result of that, is all Mike Petersen.\"<ref name=\"RichardsIGNS2\" />\n\n====Ian Quinn====\nIan Quinn (portrayed by [[David Conrad]])<ref name=\"Conrad\" /> is a wealthy industrialist/philanthropist and the CEO of Quinn Worldwide and a former partner of Franklin Hall who is involved with The Clairvoyant. He acquires Deathlok technology for Mike Peterson, and attempts to sell more Deathlok soldiers to the U.S. military. After Garrett is defeated, Quinn is absorbed by the gravitonium by Raina.\n\n====Raina====\n{{For|the subsequent comic book version|Raina (comics)}}\nRaina (portrayed by [[Ruth Negga]]) was raised by Calvin Johnson, and grew up with stories of her heritage as an Inhuman, and her potential to be more. Becoming the Project Centipede recruiter due to her interest in powered people, Raina works with Hydra in an attempt to replicate the GH-325 serum that was used to resurrect Coulson. She eventually goes through Terrigenesis, gaining the power of precognition, but also a monstrous appearance. Raina comes to accept her new circumstances, and later allows Jiaying to kill her so that Skye can learn of the former's true intent. It was later revealed that Raina had the gravitonium absorb Ian Quinn.\n\nNegga was first cast as a guest star in October 2013,<ref name=\"Negga\" /> with executive producer Jeffrey Bell later explaining that \"Ruth Negga showed up and we just fell in love with her and found ways to use her beyond our initial conception\".<ref name=\"NeggaMarvel\" /> Foley was informed of Raina ahead of time, allowing her to flesh out the character with illustrations, as well as print specific fabric. When Raina is introduced in \"Girl in the Flower Dress\", Foley and Negga \"wanted to show a progression in her dresses that reflects where her character might be going\", with her initially unclear intentions paired with \"a softer silhouette\" and a pattern of white with black flowers. For her second appearance in the episode, \"it's becoming clear that she has an agenda\" so the dress is more streamlined, and the colors are flipped to black with white flowers. For her final appearance in the episode, her dress is red with black flowers. Foley concluded, \"By the time you see her again in [\"The Bridge\"] you know she means business\".<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> After Raina is transformed in the second season she hides her hideous appearance with a hooded jacket, which Foley subtly added a flower pattern to, as \"she was always going to be the girl in the flower dress, so I wanted to pay tribute to that\".<ref name=\"FoleyJiayingRaina\" />\n\nRaina's Inhuman look was created by [[Glenn Hetrick]] of Optic Nerve Studios. To get to the final look, the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the [[Clive Barker]] film ''[[Nightbreed]]'', specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because \"She\u2019s a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong \u2014 it creates such a striking silhouette\". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to \"make her feel like the first real Inhuman\" and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, \"Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [the makeup].\"<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" />\n\n====Victoria Hand====\n{{further|Victoria Hand}}\nVictoria Hand (portrayed by [[Saffron Burrows]]) is introduced as the high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who runs The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base. After discovering that Hydra exists within S.H.I.E.L.D., Hand turns on Coulson, believing him to be a double agent. However, Garrett soon reveals himself to be the traitor, and Hand works with Coulson to detain him. She is killed by Ward when he reveals himself to be a member of Hydra to save Garrett from imprisonment. Her Framework counterpart was responsible for bringing Ward into the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\nIn November 2013, Burrows was announced as playing Hand,<ref name=\"Burrows\" /> who was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Mike Deodato]], and played an integral role in their ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' comic book series.<ref name=\"HandComics\" /> The character was intentionally introduced in the first season as a mislead for the true identity of the Clairvoyant.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> With the introduction of [[Lucy Lawless]] as Isabelle Hartley in the second season, the executive producers considered establishing a relationship between Hand and Hartley, since the comic book-counterpart of Hand was in a relationship with a character called Isabelle, but Tancharoen stated that \"it started to be irresponsible if we addressed it to not address it with more weight and time and energy.\"<ref name=\"HartleyHand\" /> However, this relationship was later hinted at onscreen in \"[[One Door Closes]]\".<ref name=\"HartleyHand2\" />\n\n====Davis====\nDavis (portrayed by [[Maximilian Osinski]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who worked alongside Phil Coulson's group on investigating the explosion at StatiCorp's Particle Accelerator Complex before the Hydra Uprising. He later returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. when Jeffrey Mace became its director.<ref name=\"S1Disc2\" /> During the LMD infiltration of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Davis and a few surviving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents help Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons escape the base. Davis helps protect Daisy and Simmons as they infiltrate the Framework to save their friends, after which he is attacked by Ophelia and badly wounded. Mike Peterson saves him and later reunites him with Coulson's fugitive team at the Lighthouse. Davis later assisted in the search for Fitz and Enoch. During Izel's raid of the Lighthouse, she possessed Davis' body and manipulated him into falling to his death in the control room.\n\n====Anne Weaver====\nAnne Weaver (portrayed by [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]])<ref name=\"Adams\" /> is the director of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology. Following the fall of the original organization in which she fought one of Hydra's enhanced soldiers until she was saved by Tomas Calderon, she joins the leadership of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" Anne takes over command of the S.H.I.E.L.D. warship ''The Iliad'' following the death of Robert Gonzales.\n\n====John Garrett / The Clairvoyant====\n{{further|John Garrett (comics)}}\nJohn Garrett (portrayed by [[Bill Paxton]]) was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was left for dead by that organization, and only survived by becoming the first Deathlok. Joining Hydra, he became \"The Clairvoyant\", leader of the Centipede group, and was focused on discovering the secret to Coulson's resurrection given the impending failure of his now outdated Deathlok technology. Under the guise of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tasked with capturing and interrogating Ian Quinn, Garrett joins in Coulson's efforts to find the GH-325 drug. Based on his findings, Raina is able to synthesize a version of the drug, which does save his life. However, after Hydra is revealed to have infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Garret is outed as the Clairvoyant, Coulson kills him by disintegration.\n\nIn December 2013, \"a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward\" was set to be added to the series.<ref name=\"NewRecurring\" /> The next month, Paxton was cast as Agent [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]], \"a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger\".<ref name=\"PaxtonTVGuide\" /> Garrett was first introduced by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] in ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]''.<ref name=\"GarrettComics\" /> Jed Whedon said that \"We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when we were talking about the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it.\"<ref name=\"PaxtonIGN\" /> Following the revelation that Garrett was The Clairvoyant, Paxton said, \"He\u2019s felt like he\u2019s found a true home in Hydra, which is more of a Darwinian outfit. It\u2019s survival of the fittest. He can relate to that.\"<ref name=\"PaxtonMarvel\" />\n\n====Antoine Triplett====\nAntoine Triplett (portrayed by [[B.J. Britt]]) worked with Garrett until the Hydra reveal, after which he joins Coulson's team. Trip perishes when he becomes trapped in the chamber Skye and Raina undergo Terrigenesis in and gets hit by a fragment of the Diviner. In the Framework, Antoine Triplett is Jeffrey Mace's inside man who got caught and was incarcerated at a Hydra Cultivation Enlightenment Camp until he was freed by Mace and Phil Coulson.\n\nIn December 2013, \"an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons\" was set to be added to the series.<ref name=\"NewRecurring\" /> In February, Britt was announced as cast in the role of Triplett.<ref name=\"Britt\" /> Britt's smile and charm were incorporated into the character after he had worked with the writers for several episodes, with Tancharoen saying to Britt \"I love your smile. We have to incorporate the smile of Trip into the show.\"<ref name=\"BrittDeath\" /> Britt said of the character, \"Trip likes to make sure everything is in order...he\u2019s going make sure that stuff doesn\u2019t go wrong. [But] I still feel like Trip has something to prove. That\u2019s going to cross over to the second season where Trip wants to show Coulson that he can trust him.\"<ref name=\"BrittRebuilding\" /> Britt returned in the fourth season to reprise the character within the Framework reality.<ref name=\"BrittS4\" />\n\n====Glenn Talbot / Graviton====\n{{further|Glenn Talbot|Graviton (comics)}}\nGlenn Talbot (portrayed by [[Adrian Pasdar]]) is a [[United States Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and later [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] who hunts active S.H.I.E.L.D. agents after the organization's disbandment. Coulson earns his trust over time, and the two soon enter an agreement in which S.H.I.E.L.D. provides the government with sensitive assets and helps with the take down of Hydra in exchange for being left alone. He is made head of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit (ATCU) following the death of Rosalind Price, an arrangement which sees him reluctantly working for Coulson. Glenn Talbot is later placed in a coma following a head shot caused by the Daisy Johnson LMD at a government meeting. Talbot was later revealed to be a prisoner of General Hale until Coulson managed to free him. However, upon calling his wife Carla, Hale's subordinate Candice Lee forces her to read a script to activate his brainwashing that occurred during his imprisonment. Talbot eventually enters the Rebirth machine to absorb gravitonium, becoming Graviton. He finds Robin Hinton so she can tell him where the gravitonium within the Earth is located. During his fight with Johnson, Talbot is blasted into space after Johnson takes the Centipede Serum where his body becomes frozen in ice.\n\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] for ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #61, Talbot was a recurring antagonist of the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"TalbotComics\" /> Pasdar was cast as Talbot by March 2014, with this version focused on taking down Hydra.<ref name=\"Pasdar\" /> In the fifth season, Talbot becomes the villain Graviton, despite the series previously introducing Franklin Hall in the first season, the character who becomes the villain in the comics.<ref name=\"Graviton\" /><ref name=\"Graviton2\" />\n\n====The Koenigs====\n{{further|Eric Koenig}}\nEric, Billy, Sam, and Thurston Koenig (all portrayed by [[Patton Oswalt]]) are identical brothers. The former three are S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, programmers in the initial S.H.I.E.L.D. LMD program. Eric is stationed at the Providence base and assists Coulson in the wake of Hydra's emergence, but is soon killed by Ward. Coulson and his team meet Billy, the brother of Eric, at the Playground base soon after. Billy and Sam work with Coulson on the mysterious Theta Protocol, the maintenance of a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[helicarrier]] for use by [[Nick Fury]]. Later, Coulson entrusts the Darkhold to Billy and Sam, who hide the book in the Labyrinth, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base only accessible by the Koenigs. Thurston is a slam poet activist who is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and refers to them as a bunch of \"sheep\" due to the death of their brother Eric\n\nOswalt joined the series as Eric Koenig in March 2014.<ref name=\"Oswalt\" /> This version of the character is loosely inspired by one that first appeared in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #27.<ref name=\"Oswalt\" /> Oswalt also portrays Eric's brothers.<ref name=\"BloodTVGuide\" /> After previously working on Joss Whedon's ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' and being a long time fan of Marvel, Oswalt was sought for the part specifically.<ref name=\"Oswalt\" />\n\n====Calvin Johnson====\n{{further|Mister Hyde (comics)}}\nCalvin Johnson (portrayed by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), a young doctor, met the Inhuman Jiaying while in China. The two eventually married, and had a daughter, Daisy. After Jiaying was torn apart by Hydra, and Daisy was taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Cal stitched his wife back together, found innocent people whose life-force was used to bring Jiaying back to life, and began searching for his daughter, at some point changing his last name. He also began experimenting on himself in an attempt to be stronger, blaming himself for not protecting his family. Jiaying eventually abandoned the search to live a peaceful life with other Inhumans like her, but Cal continued, eventually meeting Daisy\u2014now going by Skye\u2014and over time forming a bond with her, despite her hatred for his past actions. Coulson later convinces Cal that Jiaying is a monster who has forced him to do terrible things, and when Jiaying starts a war with S.H.I.E.L.D. that leads to a face down with Skye, Cal kills Jiaying. S.H.I.E.L.D. then wipes Cal's memory to allow him to live a peaceful life.\n\nDuring the first-season finale, Skye's father is briefly seen from behind, portrayed by a [[stand-in]]. In August 2014, MacLachlan was cast in the role,<ref name=\"MacLachlan/Pasdar\" /> to recur throughout the second season.<ref name=\"MacLachlan\" /> Initially referred to as \"The Doctor\",<ref name=\"MacLachlan/Pasdar\" /> his character was revealed to be Calvin Zabo, also known as Mister Hyde, in December 2014.<ref name=\"DaisyCal\" /> Zabo was created by Stan Lee and [[Don Heck]] for ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' in 1963, and is influenced by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.<ref name=\"HydeComics\" /> MacLachlan's makeup for his transformation into the Mister Hyde persona in the second-season finale took around two and a half hours to apply.<ref name=\"MacLachlanMakeup\" /> Following the conclusion of season two, Bell said on Cal's storyline, \"He got to live a happily ever after in a beautiful way. We would never write off the idea of finding more story for him down the road, but we had a great time with Kyle this year and feel like that was a story that ended nicely.\"<ref name=\"BellEWS2Finale\" /> Bell elaborated that they \"felt like everything he did came from the right place but that he was just a really horrible, broken man. The idea of [using] the T.A.H.I.T.I. program to reset him as the good person that has always been in there was too good to pass up.\"<ref name=\"BellIGNS2Finale\" />\n\n===Introduced in season two===\n====Daniel Whitehall====\n{{further|Kraken (Marvel Comics)}}\nWerner Reinhardt (portrayed by [[Reed Diamond]]), a high ranking Nazi officer and an elite member of Hydra in 1945, was experimenting on the Diviner when his base was taken by the SSR and he was imprisoned for life. Released by [[Alexander Goodwin Pierce|Alexander Pierce]] in 1988, Reinhardt discovered that a woman unaffected by the Diviner, Jiaying, had apparently not aged in four decades. Dissecting her, Reinhardt discovered the secret to her youthfulness and used it to de-age himself. Taking the name Daniel Whitehall, he became the North American leader of Hydra following Pierce's death, fighting against Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. while remaining interested in the Diviner and other alien matters. He is killed by Coulson while trying to unlock the true power of the Diviner. It was revealed that he trained General Hale and had her partake in raising Hydra's next leader through insemination.\n\nAt the San Diego Comic Con in July 2014, Diamond was announced as portraying [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)|Daniel Whitehall]],<ref name=\"BloodTVGuide\" /> also known as the Kraken in the comics,<ref name=\"DiamondMarvel\" /> where he was introduced by [[Jonathan Hickman]] for ''[[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]'' #7.<ref name=\"KrakenComics\" /> Diamond previously worked with the creators on ''Dollhouse'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (2012 film)|Much Ado About Nothing]]'', and though they had wanted him for parts throughout the first season, he had been unavailable due to commitments to another series. Diamond accepted the role of Whitehall with just 24 hours to prepare, during which he formed the character's German accent to use for flashback sequences. In developing the character, Diamond watched [[Nazi]] documentaries, and re-watched Marvel's films, looking at the characters of Loki and [[Red Skull]] in particular. From the former, Diamond was inspired by his ''The Avengers'' quote, \"I am burdened with glorious purpose\", as he had never played a super villain, \"someone who really believed that they were the best person to rule the universe, or at least the Earth.\" For [[Hugo Weaving]]'s portrayal of the Red Skull, Diamond looked at his anger and voice to see \"how [Whitehall] would fit in within that spectrum\", and settled on \"this is TV. I\u2019m the smiling, calm, villain.\" Diamond also sought advice from [[Malcolm McDowell]], who told him to \"Always smile and let the lines do the work.\" The character is often seen cleaning his glasses, an \"identifying quality\" devised by Jed Whedon.<ref name=\"DiamondMarvel\" />\n\n====Sunil Bakshi====\nSunil Bakshi (portrayed by [[Simon Kassianides]]), the right-hand man to Whitehall, is instrumental in the brainwashing of Hydra's subjects, including S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Kara Palamas, who later gets revenge by brainwashing Bakshi herself. Now loyal to Palamas and Ward, Bakshi sacrifices his life to save the latter when Simmons tries to kill him. In the Framework, Sunil Bakshi is a [[news presenter]] who hosts ''The Bakshi Report'' where he reports on Hydra's actions against the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\nKassianides, a fan of the series and of comic books in general,<ref name=\"KassianidesRelishes\" /> was cast in the \"major recurring role\" of Bakshi in July 2014.<ref name=\"Kassianides\" /> The producers intended for Bakshi to be killed off in the fifth episode of the second season, but changed their minds after Kassianides' early table reads and extended his run on the show through to the nineteenth episode.<ref name=\"ThisWeek22\" /> Speaking of the character's relationship with Whitehall, Kassianides explained, \"Bakshi really feels he can act under the authority of Whitehall on his own, using his own judgment. He has the trust of Whitehall and is acting as he sees fit, the consequences of which will play out.\" On Bakshi's motivations and thought process, Kassianides said \"When you\u2019re that committed to any ideology, I think that it allows for elements of insanity ... whether that\u2019s been trained in him or it\u2019s inherent, it\u2019s not clear, but he\u2019s certainly at that point where hurting people, torturing people, and operating under this ideology is something he quite enjoys.\"<ref name=\"KassianidesRelishes\" />\n\n====Carl Creel====\n{{further|Absorbing Man}}\nCarl Creel (portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]]) is a Hydra operative recruited by Garrett and brainwashed by Whitehall who can absorb the properties of whatever he touches.<ref name=\"Wade\" /> He is later hired by Talbot to serve as his bodyguard, but quits when Talbot is injured and hospitalized. Sometime later, Creel is hired by General Hale to help her hunt S.H.I.E.L.D., but he betrays her after learning she is holding Talbot prisoner, helping Coulson and Talbot escape. Creel also forms a mental link with gravitonium and discovers that the minds of Franklin Hall and Ian Quinn live on inside it after it absorbed them. While recuperating in the hospital, Creel is visited by Glenn Talbot who absorbs Creel into himself with his gravitonium.\n\nWade was cast in the role in August 2014.<ref name=\"Wade\" />\n\n====Kara Palamas / Agent 33====\nKara Palamas (portrayed by [[Maya Stojan]]) was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent betrayed to Hydra by the then undercover Morse and subjected to brainwashing by Bakshi and Whitehall. The now Hydra-loyal Palamas used a nanomask to take on the appearance of May, and when the latter electrocutes Palamas whilst in this disguise, she is left stuck as May, but deformed. After Coulson kills Whitehall, Palamas works with Ward, the two forming a romantic relationship while the latter does everything in his power to bring Palamas \"closure\". They get her nanomask repaired so that she can become whoever she wishes, brainwash Bakshi, and kidnap Morse in an attempt to force a confession out of her. When May and Hunter come to rescue Morse, Ward accidentally kills Palamas while she is in disguise as May.\n\nWhile Stojan portrays Palamas,<ref name=\"Stojan\" /><ref name=\"Agent33Name\" /> the character is also portrayed by other cast members, including Ming-Na Wen and Chloe Bennet, when she takes on the appearance of their characters.<ref name=\"WenBennetAgent33\" /> Stojan had to balance working on the series with her concurrent recurring role on ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', but was still able to appear in every episode offered to her.<ref name=\"StojanQ&A\" /> Speaking about portraying Palamas, and the differences between her and May, Wen said, \"not only did she lose her face, she lost her will, really. I mean she is completely controlled by Whitehall and...it\u2019s sort of a sad character for me to portray because she\u2019s so opposite from May. May is so confident and knows exactly what she needs to do and can get the job done based on her own opinions and with Agent 33, not only is she disfigured, not only doesn\u2019t she have her face anymore, she doesn\u2019t have her identity anymore.\"<ref name=\"Wen33\" /> After Palamas breaks free of her brainwashing and joins Ward, Stojan said of the character and their new relationship, \"That love/romance that she has with Ward...she's really, I think, trying to find herself\u2014whether it's good or bad. She truly believes in that one man, and she's going to follow him.\n\n====Jiaying Johnson====\nJiaying Johnson (portrayed by [[Dichen Lachman]])<ref name=\"Lachman\" /><ref name=\"Jiaying\" /> is the Inhuman wife of Calvin Johnson, and Daisy's mother, who does not age and can heal rapidly thanks to an elder of her village giving their life each year. Pieced back together by Calvin after Whitehall dissects her to discover the secret to her abilities, Jiaying is never the same, and goes to great lengths to find her daughter, now willingly taking innocent lives to feed her abilities, having no regard for humans. Eventually Jiaying tries to escape this new persona by founding Afterlife, a haven for Inhumans, and when Daisy (going by Skye) journeys to Afterlife, Jiaying happily becomes her mentor. However, when S.H.I.E.L.D. discovers the location of Afterlife, Jiaying starts a war with them, and attempts to kill all humans with artificial Terrigen crystals. She even tries to drain Skye's life when the former turns on her, but is stopped by Calvin, who kills her. After Tony Caine gives Daisy the information about the modified Project Centipede serum that John Garrett used, she goes to the graveyard and starts exhuming Jaiying's grave.\n\nSpeaking about the levels of violence depicted in the series, Bell admitted that the executive producers and the network did question the graphicness of the sequence where Jiaying is dissected by Whitehall, but that it was ultimately kept as is because they felt that \"it was important for you to understand how horrible that was and what she went through and miraculously survived\u2014that was a big part of our story.\"<ref name=\"BellJiaying\" /> For Jiaying's costume, Foley \"wanted her to have an other-worldly kind of feeling and then also, at the time, Dichen [Lachman] was pregnant, so we needed to come up with a silhouette that could hide the pregnancy, and kind of grow with her which is why we landed on that tunic. The great thing about it is that it had this really cool Asian feeling to it with the high neck and the buttons down the front.\"<ref name=\"FoleyJiayingRaina\" /> Foley chose the fabrics for Jiaying's tunics based on what was going on in the story and how she felt the character was thinking.<ref name=\"FoleyJiayingRaina\" />\n\nIn regards to Jiaying's perceived role as the main villain of the second season due to her actions in the final episodes, Bell said \"In our minds, [Jiaying] wasn\u2019t a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyS2Finale\" /> After the character's backstory and motivations were revealed, she was compared by some to the Marvel Comics character [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. In response to this, Bell said \"We didn\u2019t consciously mimic [Magneto], but what they both have in common is a valid motive. Jiaying was ripped to shreds...I feel like her motive is really earned in the same way that Magneto\u2019s is fairly earned. We always want our antagonists to have good motives...We tried to make everything she says be true.\"<ref name=\"BellJiaying\" />\n\n====Gordon====\n{{For|the subsequent comic book version|Gordon (comics)}}\nGordon (portrayed by [[Jamie Harris (actor)|Jamie Harris]])<ref name=\"211Synopsis\" /> is an eyeless Inhuman with the ability to teleport and emit force fields. His transition to an Inhuman was tended to by Jiaying, and he remained loyal to her in his adult life, ensuring that only a select few could enter and leave Afterlife, and joining with her in her war against S.H.I.E.L.D. While trying to spread Terrigen Mist through the ventilation system of ''The Iliad'', he is killed by Fitz.\n\n====Andrew Garner / Lash====\n{{redirect|Andrew Garner|the football player|Andy Garner}}\n{{further|Lash (comics)}}\nAndrew Garner (portrayed by [[Blair Underwood]]) is May's ex-husband and a psychologist at Culver University who assesses gifted people for S.H.I.E.L.D. Following a vacation with May to try and rekindle their relationship, Garner is exposed to Terrigen which unlocks Inhuman abilities within him; he becomes the monstrous Lash (portrayed by [[Matt Willig]]), who uses energy abilities to hunt and kill 'unworthy' Inhumans. Garner surrenders himself to S.H.I.E.L.D. before the transformation becomes permanent, and manages to say goodbye to May before completely becoming Lash. S.H.I.E.L.D. then send Lash to fight Hive, hoping that his Inhuman purpose is to destroy the latter. Though this is not the case, Lash is able to purge Daisy Johnson of Hive's control, before being killed by Hellfire.\n\nIn December 2014, Underwood was revealed to be cast as Garner for multiple appearances starting in the second season.<ref name=\"Underwood\" /> In July 2015, the Inhuman Lash, who was created by [[Charles Soule]] and [[Joe Madureira]] for ''Inhuman'' #1, was announced as appearing in the third season.<ref name=\"SDCC2015\" /><ref name=\"WilligRaba\" /> That August, Willig was revealed to be cast as Lash,<ref name=\"WilligRaba\" /> with Hetrick again working alongside the series' makeup and visual effects teams to realize the character's \"unique look\" from the comics.<ref name=\"HetrickLash\" /> Whedon noted that it would be their \"own take on [Lash]. There will be some elements from the comics for sure, but as we always do...we\u2019re changing it up a little bit.\"<ref name=\"WhedonTancharoenEW\" /> Bell elaborated that \"it\u2019s hard to have a hidden or magical city\" in the MCU, such as Lash's comic home of Orollan, but \"Lash\u2019s agenda can certainly remain true to what it was in the comics\", with him judging whether Inhumans are worthy.<ref name=\"BellCBOct2015\" /> Willig's Lash make-up initially took six hours to apply, but the make-up team was able to reduce the time to four and a half hours.<ref name=\"LashMakeUp\" />\n\nWhedon noted that the series already has several Inhumans who are \"fairly attractive\" and the producers wanted \"to also show the other side of the change that bad things can happen\", with Tancharoen elaborating that \"on a very basic level, we were interested in putting a monster in the mix, because he is not human and his looks are pretty crazy and scary. We wanted to put our team up against something like that.\"<ref name=\"WhedonTancharoenEW\" /> On how the cast and characters react to seeing Lash, Bennet said, \"I like to think that they've seen their fair share of crazy shit and that's just something that's pretty insane but not totally mind-blowing.\"<ref name=\"BennetCBSep2015\" /> Following the reveal that Lash still had a human form, Bell said that they would spend time exploring different characters as potential candidates,<ref name=\"BellCBOct2015\" /> though the human form was revealed to be Garner two episodes later.<ref name=\"GarnerLash\" /> For the onscreen CGI transformation from Garner to Lash, Underwood and Willig were 3D scanned (the latter while in full prosthetics and make-up), and then Underwood provided motion capture for the sequence, as visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack noted the lack of resemblance between Underwood and the final Lash design, and so wanted to keep as much of Underwood's \"essence\" throughout the transformation process as possible. Underwood portrayed the transformation as \"painful\", \"rigid\", and \"tiring\", though he noted that it would become easier for the character to transform the more it happened.<ref name=\"LashTransformation\" />\n\nGoing into the third season, Underwood had only known that the producers wanted to explore more of Garner's personal life, after his appearances in the second season were \"as an appendage to Agent May...a device and a construct to open her up and see more of her life.\" He also did not see the Lash reveal coming, which he did not learn until the table read for \"[[Devils You Know]]\", when it is presumed Garner is dead, and the producers approached him afterwards to tell them their plan for the character. Underwood compared the Garner / Lash dynamic to [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Jekyll and Hyde]] and Bruce Banner / the Hulk, and compared the new May / Garner dynamic to ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref name=\"UnderwoodCBRNov2015\" /> On Lash's motivations, Underwood stated that \"Lash sees [the Inhumans] as an exalted society and it's an honor to be an Inhuman. Not everyone is worthy of that moniker. He takes it upon himself to be judge, jury and executioner of who is worthy of being an Inhuman and who is not.\"<ref name=\"UnderwoodCBRNov2015\" /> Elaborating on this and Garner's connection to Lash, Underwood said, \"If you look at his work as a psychologist...in S.H.I.E.L.D., he determines [who] is worthy and is not worthy to be part of the Secret Warriors team...it makes sense that it's kind of that same kind of rationale, but on steroids\".<ref name=\"UnderwoodENov2015\" />\n\n====Robert Gonzales====\nRobert Gonzales (portrayed by [[Edward James Olmos]]) is an elderly S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, tactician, and the commander of ''The Iliad'' during the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. who is tasked with protecting the Kree monolith. He is convinced not to destroy the ship (to prevent Hydra from claiming the monolith) so that the hundreds of agents on board may live, disobeying Fury's orders, and subsequently becomes a founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" alongside Anne Weaver, Tomas Calderon, and Agent Oliver. He remains hypocritical of secrets and all things alien, even after agreeing to keep Coulson on as Director of a new, unified S.H.I.E.L.D., but still attempts to negotiate with Jiaying and the Inhumans peacefully. However, Jiaying kills Gonzales and shoots herself, claiming that he attacked her, in order to start a war against S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Olmos would be joining the series as Robert Gonzales,<ref name=\"Olmos\" /> with Olmos describing joining the MCU one of the high points of his career.<ref name=\"OlmosE\" /> Concerning the apparent difference in philosophies between Gonzales and Coulson, Olmos explained that \"the situations that I\u2019ve come across and the situations that he\u2019s come across have changed our ability to work with the same understanding. He\u2019s working like Fury worked and under that understanding. I don\u2019t work under Fury\u2019s understanding....I think that Coulson\u2019s philosophy is the same as mine! We are S.H.I.E.L.D. We are not anything but S.H.I.E.L.D. people. It\u2019s just that our S.H.I.E.L.D., the one that we originally put forth, was very, very transparent. And the S.H.I.E.L.D. that has materialized under Fury\u2014and now Coulson\u2014is much more secretive.\" Olmos also compared the relationship between the two factions of S.H.I.E.L.D. to that between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref name=\"OlmosMarvel\" />\n\n====Alisha Whitley====\nAlisha Whitley (portrayed by Alicia Vela-Bailey)<ref name=\"SOS\" /> is a duplicating Inhuman who was loyal to Jiaying until she learned that the latter started the war with S.H.I.E.L.D. After Jiaying's death, Alisha helps S.H.I.E.L.D. until she falls under the influence of Hive. She is later murdered by a Kree reaper offscreen.\n\n====Kebo====\nKebo (portrayed by Daz Crawford) is a member of Hydra, second-in-command to Ward until he is killed by Morse. Crawford only signed on for the second-season finale,<ref name=\"SOS\" /><ref name=\"CrawfordCV\" /> but the writers liked him in the character and so brought him back for the third season.<ref name=\"CrawfordCV\" /> Crawford said that Kebo has reservations about Ward as a boss, but \"some people like their bosses, some people don\u2019t.\"<ref name=\"CrawfordCV\" />\n\n===Introduced in season three===\n====Rosalind Price====\nRosalind Price (portrayed by [[Constance Zimmer]]) is the head of the ATCU as it crosses paths with S.H.I.E.L.D. in the hunt for Inhumans. After developing a romantic relationship with Coulson, Price is killed by Ward.\n\nIn July 2015, Zimmer was cast as Price,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"Ep301\" /> who Gregg described as \"a potent...I wouldn\u2019t say doppelganger, but she\u2019s definitely got a lot in common with Coulson. She represents a character who\u2019s not someone he comes across every day, who has more in common with him than most other people do.\"<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> That September, Bell elaborated, \"Where in the past, Coulson frequently plays sort of a paternal role on the show, because Daisy is kind of a surrogate daughter figure\u2014suddenly there's another adult [in Price], who can banter, who can hold her own, and there's something nice about seeing him in that relationship.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2015\" />\n\n====Luther Banks====\nLuther Banks (portrayed by [[Andrew Howard]])<ref name=\"Howard\" /> is an ATCU agent and former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] loyal to Price. He is killed by Giyera.\n\n====Joey Gutierrez====\nJoey Gutierrez (portrayed by [[Juan Pablo Raba]]) is an Inhuman and former construction worker with the ability to melt certain metals who is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. for Daisy Johnson's Secret Warriors team.\n\nRaba was announced as cast in August 2015.<ref name=\"WilligRaba\" /> Scott Meslow of [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] and Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', reviewing the season three episode \"Laws of Nature\", both indicated their pleasure in seeing Gutierrez, a gay character, appear on the series, which Meslow noted appeared to be the first openly gay character in the MCU.<ref name=\"VultureLoNReview\" /><ref name=\"AVClubLoNReview\" />\n\n====Werner von Strucker====\n{{further|Werner von Strucker}}\nWerner von Strucker (portrayed by [[Spencer Treat Clark]])<ref name=\"302IGN\" /> is the son of Hydra leader Baron \u201cWolfgang\u201d von Strucker, who is recruited to Hydra by Ward after Wolfgang's death. After failing to follow Ward's orders to kill Garner, Werner is left in a vegetative state by Kebo, and is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. He is later hospitalized in an asylum and teams up with General Hale and her daughter Ruby upon being freed. Werner gave in to General Hale's demands when he saw one of his father's experiments in the form of Carl Creel lifting weights. After Ruby gets 8% of the gravitonium in her, Werner is accidentally killed by Ruby.\n\n====Giyera====\nR. Giyera (portrayed by [[Mark Dacascos]])<ref name=\"Dacascos\" /> is a telekinetic Inhuman and head of security for the ATCU, secretly loyal to Malick. He is eventually swayed over to Hive's side, until he is killed by Fitz.\n\n====Polly Hinton====\nPolly Hinton (portrayed by [[Lola Glaudini]])<ref name=\"315Synopsis\" /> is the wife of Charles Hinton and mother of Robin Hinton.\n\n====J.T. James / Hellfire====\n{{further|Hellfire (J.T. Slade)}}\nJ.T. James (portrayed by [[Axle Whitehead]]) is an Inhuman who was refused the right of Terrigenesis by Jiaying and banished from Afterlife. Johnson subjects James to the transformation while under the influence of Hive, giving James the ability to imbue objects with fire. He is then taken under Hive's influence himself, and chooses the codename Hellfire. After Hive is destroyed, James suffers terrible withdrawal symptoms and comes to hate being an Inhuman as a result. He betrays his kind to the Watchdogs, helping them track and kill other Inhumans, with the promise that they would kill him when they are done.\n\nWhitehead first guest starred as James in \"Paradise Lost\", introduced as someone from Lincoln's past, with Whitehead and Mitchell having previously starred together on ''[[Home and Away]]''.<ref name=\"WhiteheadHaA\" /> With the character recurring through the rest of the third season, he was revealed to be an adaptation of the comic Secret Warrior character Hellfire.<ref name=\"Hellfire\" /> Executive producer Tancharoen felt it was \"a no-brainer\" to include Hellfire in the series, despite him not being Inhuman in the comics. Whedon expanded, saying, \"We liked his attitude. He\u2019s a tell-it-like-it-is guy. He\u2019s a little bit of a prick. He does not care if he\u2019s liked, and that\u2019s fun to write.\" The producers were also able to find a way to incorporate Hellfire's signature fire chain into the series.<ref name=\"HellfireEW\" /> In the fourth season, it is revealed that his full name is J.T. James.<ref name=\"JamesName\" />\n\n====Anderson====\nAnderson (portrayed by Alexander Wraith)<ref name=\"316Synopsis\" /> is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and assistant to Coulson.\n\n====Piper====\nPiper (portrayed by [[Briana Venskus]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and member of May's strike team.<ref name=\"Piper\" />\n\nIn season six, she helps to look for Fitz and even helps to deal with Izel. Piper helps to evacuate Flint from the temple.\n\n====Aida \"Ophelia\" / Madame Hydra====\n{{further|AIDA (comics)|Viper (Madame Hydra)}}\nAida (portrayed by [[Mallory Jansen]]) is a Life Model Decoy, an android body based on Radcliffe's former lover and partner Agnes Kitsworth (also portrayed by Jansen) into which he transferred his artificial intelligence AIDA (voiced by Amanda Rea). After the ''Darkhold'' shows Radcliffe the secret to eternal life, Radcliffe programs Aida to go rogue in an attempt to steal the book from S.H.I.E.L.D. She is ultimately beheaded in battle against S.H.I.E.L.D., and Radcliffe builds a new model of the android. Aida later kills Kitsworth, so her consciousness can reside in the Framework reality. Aida enters the Framework where she takes up the name \"Ophelia\" and is also known as Madame Hydra, the leader of Hydra. She also has a relationship with Leo Fitz in his alias of The Doctor. Agnes also resides in the Framework, living with Radcliffe's consciousness on Ogygia before she is deleted by The Doctor. With the help of Project Looking Glass, Aida succeeds in making her organic body, and once again goes by Ophelia. Ophelia also gains the Inhuman abilities of teleportation, electric charge manipulation, and a healing factor. She is later killed by Phil Coulson possessed by Ghost Rider.\n\nThe artificial intelligence AIDA is briefly voiced by Amanda Rea in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"321-322Synopsis\" /> By June 2016, casting was underway for a \"very attractive\" actress to portray the robot in a recurring role for the fourth season. The character was described as moving around \"quite naturally\", but speaking \"a bit formally\" like [[Iron Man]]'s [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] A.I. in the MCU films.<ref name=\"AIDAS4\" /> In August, Jansen was cast in the role;<ref name=\"Jansen\" /> she also portrays Agnes Kitsworth,<ref name=\"413Synopsis\" /> for which she uses her native Australian accent.<ref name=\"413Nerdist\" /> In April 2017, it was revealed that Aida would appear in the Framework reality as Madame Hydra, also portrayed by Jansen.<ref name=\"MadameHydra\" /><ref name=\"Ophelia\" /> On having Aida become Madame Hydra, Whedon noted, \"We had what is one of most formidable female villains we\u2019ve ever had [in Aida], and we were bringing back Hydra, so it seemed like a natural pairing. She\u2019s plugged herself into this world and clearly she\u2019s trying to live some other new, unique life. We felt like if you grew up in a world and tried to be as powerful as you could be, and that world was Hydra-dominated, then it would be natural that she would become [Madame Hydra]. We thought it would be a fun way to introduce that character that\u2019s so creepy, odd, weird, and fun.\"<ref name=\"EW416EPs\" />\n\nAida's costume was custom made, and inspired by the works of [[Alexander McQueen]]. Foley wanted it to be simple to \"not take away from the character at all\", but also \"sort of a 'Where did this outfit come from?' kind of a feeling so that it's specifically hers. It just adds to the mystery of who she is.\"<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Jansen described \"Aida 2.0\" as being programmed to be more ruthless, with the character's costume a darker shade of gray than that worn by the original Aida to reflect these changes.<ref name=\"ThisWeek53\" /> New costume designer Amanda Riley took Foley's costumes for Aida as the base shape of the Madame Hydra costume, but looked to make it feel \"stronger\" and more military-esque than those costumes by having the shoulders of the costume evoke [[epaulette]]s. The costume uses the color green, which is closely tied with the character in the comics.<ref name=\"ThisWeek58\" />\n\n===Introduced in season four===\n====Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider====\n{{further|Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)}}\nRoberto \"Robbie\" Reyes (portrayed by [[Gabriel Luna]]) is a mechanic who, alongside his brother Gabe, was attacked by gang members who were hired to kill their uncle [[Eli Morrow]]. Gabe was paralyzed and Robbie was killed, but his life was saved when a Ghost Rider riding a motorcycle gave Robbie his power, creating a new Ghost Rider. Robbie lives to protect Gabe, and at night he seeks out vengeance by hunting the guilty and murdering them. His actions bring him into contact with the vigilante Quake and the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., through whom he learns of his uncle's interests in the ''Darkhold''. This leads to Robbie taking Morrow through a portal to another dimension. After returning to Earth, Robbie Reyes helps to defeat Aida and uses his new portal-making abilities to take the Darkhold far away.\n\nAdvertisements for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' ahead of the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] featuring a flaming chain lead to speculation that the character of Ghost Rider would be joining the series during the season, though it was noted that the image could indicate an increased role for Hellfire after his introduction in the third season.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Trolly\" /> When casting for a Latino character matching the description of [[Marvel Comics]]' Robbie Reyes, was revealed to be underway for the series, further speculation pointed to the inclusion of Ghost Rider, a mantle that Reyes took over in the comics.<ref name=\"AIDAS4\" /><ref name=\"GhostRiderReyes\" /> At the series' Comic-Con panel, this speculation was confirmed, and Luna was announced to be cast in the role.<ref name=\"Luna\" /> Luna had initially been hesitant to sign up for a recurring, rather than starring, role, but changed his mind once he was told that the character would be Ghost Rider, who he was a fan of growing up.<ref name=\"ThisWeek45\" /> He felt it was \"too good to be true\" that Reyes \"was a character who looked like me, acted like me, and had this amazing family dynamic with his brother\",<ref name=\"NewsaramaNYCC2016\" /> with Luna relating to the latter since his father died before he was born leaving Luna the \"oldest male in [his] immediate family\".<ref name=\"ThisWeek45\" />\n\nLuna described the Ghost Rider as a \"separate entity\" from Reyes, comparing the dynamic to the Hulk.<ref name=\"ThisWeek45\" /> Reyes was chosen as the Ghost Rider for the series, over other versions of the character, since his is the newest version from the comics, and the executive producers thought \"it would be interesting to bring in someone with [his] background into our dynamic\". Regarding if the character would be possessed by a Satanic serial killer, as in the comics, or by the more traditional Spirit of Vengeance, Tancharoen said, \"We\u2019re staying true to his circumstance. But as always with any property that we use, we\u2019re taking our liberties with it,\" with Whedon adding that they would be \"pulling a little bit from different versions of the Ghost Rider\" with \"a little mixing and matching\".<ref name=\"GhostRiderEW\" /> Luna said that due to the character's recent introduction in the comics, \"a lot of the show is going to be expanding the Ghost Rider canon\";<ref name=\"LunaTHR\" /> however Luna read all 12 issues of the ''All-New Ghost Rider'' series that introduced Reyes for preparation.<ref name=\"LunaCBR\" /> The character drives a [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1969|1969 Dodge Charger]] in the show,<ref name=\"DodgeCharger\" /> the \"Hellcharger\" of the comics which Luna nicknamed Lucy, for [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"LunaLucy\" /> The production had a hero car and a double for stunts, while the visual effects team used a CG double when needed.<ref name=\"KolpackCharger\" /> [[Eric Norris]] serves as Luna's stunt driver,<ref name=\"NewsaramaNYCC2016\" /><ref name=\"KolpackNorris\" /> with Morgan Benoit, a frequent collaborator with Luna, as his stunt double.<ref name=\"NewsaramaNYCC2016\" />\n\nThe character's signature jacket and flaming head were designed by Marvel Television creative director Joshua Shaw, based on Felipe Smith's design from the comics.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /><ref name=\"KolpackGRDesign\" /> The skull design includes exhaust-type jets of flames coming from the temples to mimic the effects on his car.<ref name=\"CreatingGR\" /> For the CG skull, Luna wore tracking markers on his face to provide performance-reference for these sequences,<ref name=\"LunaTHR\" /> especially for the animation of Ghost Rider's coal-like eyes.<ref name=\"CreatingGR\" /> Luna also wears a hood fitted with flickering lights, to create the effect of fire lighting up his costume and surfaces around him. The lights can be adjusted to match different temperature fire for different situations.<ref name=\"LunaCBR\" /><ref name=\"CreatingGR\" /> Whedon noted that the series depicts Reyes' flaming head \"exactly as much as we can afford\", adding, \"We\u2019re hoping that the character has not just a flaming skull but some real heart to him, and some depth.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderFirstLook\" /> Foley paired the character's jacket with jeans and [[Vans]] to keep Reyes \"grounded in the reality of where he was brought up in Los Angeles\". Foley also worked with Kolpack to ensure that the costume would not interfere with the visual effects.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Since a skeleton does not have a voice box, the Ghost Rider does not speak in the series.<ref name=\"KolpackGRSpeak\" />\n\nIn August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] said that the character \"could venture into other sections of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", depending on the audience's response to their take on him, saying, \"if we can tell that story in a compelling way, then the thing to do is to then have people want more. And if they want more, the networks say, oh, we want more.\" On this, Luna noted that he \"signed on the line to do all the work necessary ... that's extremely exciting.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderAug2016\" /> That October, Luna said that there had been \"rumblings\" about a spin-off for the character, but reiterated that it would depend on audience response.<ref name=\"GhostRiderOct2016\" />\n\n====Gabe Reyes====\n{{further|Gabe Reyes}}\nGabriel \"Gabe\" Reyes (portrayed by [[Lorenzo James Henrie]]) is Robbie's younger brother, who was paralyzed in the accident that led to Robbie becoming the Ghost Rider.\n\nCasting for a Latino character matching the description of Gabe Reyes, was revealed to be underway for the series at the same time as it was for Robbie.<ref name=\"AIDAS4\" /><ref name=\"GhostRiderReyes\" /> Robbie Reyes was confirmed for the series in September 2016,<ref name=\"Luna\" /> and Henrie was revealed to be portraying Gabe later that month.<ref name=\"401Synopsis\" /> The role was one of the first that Henrie auditioned for after he finished filming for ''[[Fear the Walking Dead]]'', in which his character is killed off. At his audition, Henrie confirmed that he would be able to dedicate his time to ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' without spoiling the events of ''Fear'' for the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' casting team, and was cast in the role the next day. His introduction as Gabe aired only weeks after his ''Fear the Walking Dead'' death aired.<ref name=\"HenrieAudition\" />\n\n====Lucy Bauer====\nLucy Bauer (portrayed by Lilli Birdsell)<ref name=\"Birdsell\" /><ref name=\"405Synopsis\" /> was a scientist working at Momentum Labs in a group including her husband Joseph and engineer Eli Morrow. They were experimenting with the mysterious [[Darkhold]] until Morrow took steps to gain the book's power for himself by creating a machine that turned Lucy and her co-workers into [[ghost]]-like beings. Lucy later attempts to force Morrow to restore her body, but his nephew Robbie Reyes exorcised her first with the power of the Ghost Rider, destroying her.\n\n====Jeffrey Mace / Patriot====\n{{further|Jeffrey Mace}}\nJeffrey Mace (portrayed by [[Jason O'Mara]]) is the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who was appointed to try and restore the trust of the public following the public outlawing of Steve Rogers and several of the Avengers due to the Sokovia Accords. Originally thought by the public and other members of S.H.I.E.L.D. to be an Inhuman with super-strength and invulnerability, Mace instead received his abilities from the U.S. government's Project Patriot, which used a super-serum derived from Calvin Johnson's formula. Mace received the serum after being heralded for a heroic moment at a ceremony in [[Vienna, Austria]] following the signing of the Sokovia Accords. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in need of a new, enhanced director on the recommendation of outgoing director Coulson, Talbot and the U.S. government gave the job to Mace, who they could trust. After it was revealed that Mace's powers were a lie, Coulson decided that Mace should stay on as \"the Patriot\" and the face and political leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Coulson takes back command of S.H.I.E.L.D. operations. In the Framework, Mace is the head of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance. During the raid on the Hydra Cultivation Enlightenment Camp, Mace sacrifices himself to buy everyone time to get out of the collapsing quarantine building, resulting in his death in the real world as well.\n\nA flash-forward at the end of the third-season finale revealed that Coulson would no longer be the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the fourth season. The showrunners intentionally avoided giving hints as to who the new director would be in the sequence.<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" /> After speculation in the media about which previously introduced character could be taking on the role,<ref name=\"DirectorSpeculation\" /> it was revealed that the new leader would actually be a new character to the series portrayed by O'Mara, described as a character \"whose Marvel roots go back to the 1940s\".<ref name=\"O'Mara\" /> The character was always going to be new to the series, as the executive producers felt that replacing Coulson with someone he knows \"wouldn\u2019t [provide] as much tension to mine from\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> The character was revealed to be Mace and an Inhuman with super strength with his introduction in \"Meet the New Boss\".<ref name=\"402Recap\" /><ref name=\"DirectorMace\" /><ref name=\"DirectorMace2\" /> O'Mara, a big Marvel fan as a child who has worked a lot with ABC, found out that Marvel was \"really seriously\" interested in him for the part in the same call that his agent told him that his [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] pilot ''The Infamous'' was not getting picked up to series. Within 24 hours, O'Mara had talked to Loeb, watched some of the third season of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and accepted an offer to join the season without reading a script for it. He described the character as \"high status\", saying that \"he comes in and he's the boss, telling the other characters orders. Here I come in after [the other actors] been doing this for four years and I'm telling them what to do. It's a little awkward\".<ref name=\"O'MaraJoining\" />\n\n====Ellen Nadeer====\nEllen Nadeer (portrayed by [[Parminder Nagra]])<ref name=\"Nagra\" /><ref name=\"NagraRole\" /> is a senator and leader of the Humans First movement, who hates Inhumans after her mother's death during the Chitauri invasion. Her hatred of Inhumans comes from misunderstanding their origins believing them to be aliens who have taken over the bodies of people. She fears that an invasion will happen, when all Inhumans are just a new minority on Earth. Ellen even attempts to kill her brother Vijay, who resisted Terrigenesis for seven months before being freed. This results in him cocooning a second time. Nadeer allies herself with the Watchdogs as their benefactor. When high-ranking Watchdog Tucker Shockley tests Nadeer's humanity with a Terrigen crystal, it reveals his own explosive Inhuman abilities. Nadeer and those with her die in the ensuing explosion.\n\n====Burrows====\nBurrows (portrayed by [[Patrick Cavanaugh]])<ref name=\"403Synopsis\" /> is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Public relations|PR]] division loyal to Mace. He dies during the ambush on the airplane that Coulson and Mace are on. In the Framework, Burrows is part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\n====Eli Morrow====\n{{further|Eli Morrow}}\nElias \"Eli\" Morrow (portrayed by [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]) is the uncle of Robbie and Gabe Reyes, and engineer who helped raise his nephews. After his coworkers at Momentum Energy labs began experimenting with the ''Darkhold'', Morrow came to crave its power for himself. He put Joseph Bauer into a coma trying to find the book, and ultimately turned the rest of his coworkers into ghost-like beings. S.H.I.E.L.D. breaks him out of prison believing him to be a victim, but he uses the ''Darkhold'' to create a machine that gives him the power to create matter. Ghost Rider drags Eli and himself into another dimension.\n\nThe comics version of Eli Morrow is a [[Satanist]] who, after dying, possesses his nephew Robbie and turns him into the Ghost Rider.<ref name=\"MorrowChange\" /> In August 2016, Whedon cautioned that the series would not necessarily be directly adapting the comics' storyline, saying, \"We can\u2019t say much about what we\u2019re going to do with [Robbie Reyes\u2019] origin, but we are doing our own spin on it. We don't want people who have read the comics to know exactly what's coming.\"<ref name=\"GROriginSpin\" /> In October, Morrow was confirmed to be appearing in the series, with Z\u00fa\u00f1iga cast.<ref name=\"404Synopsis\" /> He is changed for the series by introducing him as an apparently innocent man, and then revealing him to be as power hungry as his fellow scientists experimenting on the ''Darkhold''. The abilities he gains from his experiments have been compared to those of the comic character [[Molecule Man]].<ref name=\"MorrowChange\" />\n\n====Anton Ivanov / The Superior====\nAnton Ivanov (portrayed by [[Zach McGowan]])<ref name=\"412Synopsis\" /> is a reclusive Russian industrialist known as \"The Superior\", who champions traditional values and old-fashioned hardware over modern technology and extraterrestrial entities. He believes that Coulson is the cause of Earth's alien problems (due to pictures of him investigating unknown objects) and works with the Watchdogs, Senator Nadeer, and Holden Radcliffe to fight S.H.I.E.L.D. He is highly deluded, believing Inhumans are cheaters and monsters. After being crippled by Daisy Johnson, Aida decapitates Ivanov and creates an android body for his mind to control. Ivanov then creates multiple additional bodies for his mind to control. After finding Anton Ivanov's head, General Hale persuaded Ivanov to join up with her. His head was on a robot body when he confronts Yo-Yo so he could use the Particle Infusion Chamber. Ivanov was knocked out a window by Yo-Yo which finally killed him and deactivated his mechanical soldiers.\n\n====Hope MacKenzie====\nHope MacKenzie (portrayed by Jordan Rivera)<ref name=\"418Synopsis\" /> is Mack's daughter. She died shortly after birth in real life, but she appears alive in the Framework.

He abducts and sends Phil Coulson's group, except for Fitz, through time to the Lighthouse in the year 2091 due to a prophecy uncovered by Robin Hinton. He later helps Fitz to get to the same time to save the rest of his team. During the final battle with Kasius, Enoch and Deke sacrifice their lives to get Phil Coulson's team back to their own time.\n\nHis present day form later works to keep Fitz' body safe when their ship is attacked by a ship working for the Confederacy. When they arrive on the planet Kitson, Enoch and Fitz work to afford a way off. Enoch later detects the arrival of the Chronicom hunters. After Fitz is captured by Malachi, Enoch runs into Simmons stating that she shouldn't be here. When Enoch's boss Atarah shows up and learns what happened to Chronyca-2, Enoch suggests that Fitz and Simmons might come up with a time-traveling method to help the remaining Chronicoms save Chronyca-2 from destruction. To save Fitz and Simmons following their failure to come up with a time-travel solution, Enoch does something to disable Atarah and the Chronicoms with them and helps them escape. Back on the planet Kitson, Fitz, Simmons, and Enoch are captured by Mr. Kitson's men until Izel buys them off him. While Fitz and Simmons procure the same ship that Fitz worked on for the trip to Earth, Enoch takes his leave with a new mission to find a new home for the Chronicoms. Enoch contacts a fellow Chronicom anthropologist named Isaiah where he states that they must gather their broken civilization to rebuild. When Enoch meets with Isaiah, he learns that all the anthropologists have been reassigned to hunters including Isaiah as he attacks Enoch. Though Enoch takes over his body and saves Fitz and Simmons when Malachi leads the siege on the Lighthouse. He even uses a combination of Life Model Decoy technology and Chronicom technology to create an advanced LMD of Phil Coulson.\n\n===Introduced in season five===\n====Tess====\nTess (portrayed by [[Eve Harlow]]) is a resourceful, self-sufficient inhabitant of the Lighthouse with a hope for a better future.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> She was later hanged by the Kree with a message pinned to her demanding that Flint be brought to the Kree.

Kasius was sent to oversee the Lighthouse by his father after his failure in an earlier battle while his brother Faulnak oversaw the Kree Empire. During his fight with Mack, Kasius took a Kree medicine that removes his pain after killing future Elena. With help from Jemma, Mack was able to kill Kasius.\n\nRains' makeup takes 4 hours to apply.<ref name=\"KasiusMakeup\" />\n\n====Sinara====\nSinara (portrayed by [[Florence Faivre]])<ref name=\"501/502Synopsis\" /> is a female Kree in the year 2091 that serves as Kasius' second-in-command, enforcer, and head of the Kree Watch. She wields floating spheres which she uses to either attack her enemies or kill anyone that has offended Kasius. After most of Phil Coulson's group fled to the remains of Earth, Kasius sent Sinara to dispose of them. During the gravity storm fight with Daisy Johnson aboard the modified Zephyr-One, Sinara was killed when Daisy Johnson impaled her with a pipe.\n\nFaivre's makeup takes 3.5 hours to apply.<ref name=\"SinaraMakeup\" />\n\n====Grill====\nGrill (portrayed by [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]]) is a \"gruff taskmaster\" of the Lighthouse's junkyard with an unforgiving temperament, who does not have illusions about the world he lives in.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> When Grill finds out about Yo-Yo, Flint's Inhuman ability manifests where he kills Grill with assembled rocks in self-defense.\n\nVince was announced in the role in November 2017.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" />\n\n====Flint====\n{{Further|Flint (Marvel Comics)}}\nFlint (portrayed by [[Coy Stewart]]) is a young man and inhabitant of the Lighthouse looking to make something of himself, and to prove that he is capable of big things.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> He later underwent Terrigenesis where he developed geokinesis which he first used to kill Grill in self-defense. Flint later helps Mack and Yo-Yo into getting rid of the attacking Vrellnexians that were unleashed on Kasius' orders as part of his retribution on Phil Coulson's group. Before dying, an elderly Robin Hinton tells Melinda May about a vision that involves Flint which she had when she was still a child. After rebuilding the Monolith with the rocks he made, Flint joins Tess on the trawler. Upon sensing that Coulson's group made it through the Monolith, Flint and Tess work to rebuild Earth with Flint using a globe as a blueprint.\n\nIn season 6, Izel uses the Di'Allas energies to create a clone of Flint from Mack and Yo-Yo's memories in order to help her rebuild said Monoliths. After possessing Flint to rebuild the Di'Allas, Izel possessed Yo-Yo and broke Flint's leg. Flint is evacuated by Piper.\n\nStewart was announced in the role in November 2017. The role is based on a character of the same name from the ''Inhumans'' comics.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" />\n\n====Hale====\nHale (portrayed by [[Catherine Dent]]) is a female brigadier general and the mother of Ruby who hunts Phil Coulson's group after what happened to Glenn Talbot.<ref name=\"Cameron\" /> Alyssa Jirrels portrays a teenage Hale.<ref name=\"515Synopsis\" /> During her teenage life, she is a rival of Baron Strucker and a classmate of Jasper Sitwell. Daniel Whitehall selected her to bring up Hydra's next leader through insemination. Later on, she came across an alien device that enabled her to contact Qovas of an alien alliance called the Confederacy. It's her weariness of the Confederacy that led to General Hale's attempts to get S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra to work together. She soon teams up with Carl Creel and Anton Ivanov. Following Ruby's death, Hale informs Qovas that S.H.I.E.L.D. now has the gravitonium. After Talbot absorbs the gravitonium and takes command of Qovas' ship, Hale tries to control him through his Hydra reprogramming, but he rebels and crushes Hale with his powers.\n\n====Ruby Hale====\nRuby Hale (portrayed by [[Dove Cameron]]) is the daughter of General Hale who has an obsession with Daisy Johnson.<ref name=\"Cameron\" /> She has been trained as an assassin by her mother and wields [[chakram]]s which she used to slice half of Elena's arms off when she was attacking Mack.<ref name=\"CameronEW\" /> It was revealed that she was born through insemination. When Ruby gets 8% of the gravitonium in her, she starts to hear Franklin Hall and Ian Quinn's voices in her head like Carl Creel which leads to her accidentally killing Werner von Strucker. After attempts by Daisy Johnson and General Hale to get her to let them help, Elena had no choice but to use one of Ruby's chakrams to put her out of her misery, and takes her revenge against Ruby for having sliced her arms.\n\nIn November 2017, Marvel revealed that Dove Cameron had joined the season in an unspecified role,<ref name=\"CameronReveal\" /> which was revealed in January 2018 to be the character Ruby.<ref name=\"CameronJan2018\" /> Cameron described Ruby as \"a very interesting, complex, dark girl\" and \"a wild card\".<ref name=\"CameronEW\" /><ref name=\"CameronCBR\" /> When auditioning for the role, Cameron, who did not know anything about Ruby or the character, played her like a murderer, which the producers liked. This helped Cameron once she was cast in the role and learned that Ruby was some form of assassin.<ref name=\"CameronEW\" /> Regarding Ruby's relationship with her mother, Cameron felt the relationship was \"complex\" with both of these strong women. She continued, \"there\u2019s also a lot of love there. It\u2019s like a real, complicated mother-daughter relationship. It\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very gratifying. It\u2019s very scary. It\u2019s very fast. It\u2019s very physical.\"<ref name=\"CameronCBR\" />\n\n====Qovas====\nQovas (portrayed by [[Peter Mensah]]) is a Remorath representative of the Confederacy that General Hale answers to.<ref name=\"Mensah\" /> Qovas pursues the gravitonium S.H.I.E.L.D. has in their possession, by sending Remorath warriors down to the Lighthouse. This ends with the Remorath warriors being killed by a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot. During his fight with May where he is defeated, Qovas launches ionizing missiles intended to strike the Lighthouse, only to find out that Deke changed the coordinates to strike his ship, killing him.\n\n===Introduced in season six===\n====Marcus Benson====\nMarcus Benson (portrayed by [[Barry Shabaka Henley]]) is a Natural Science professor and colleague of Andrew Garner who May recruited to offer his scientific expertise to S.H.I.E.L.D. He later gained an airplane to head to Central America where he found information about Izel. Izel summons him to the Zephyr while possessing Mack for the location of a temple she needs. She torments him with an  apparition of Benson's deceased husband Thomas, whom claims Benson was drunk when he ordered Thomas off life-support following a car accident. Benson gives up the location. Mack and Yo-Yo are able to send him to safety by ejecting him from the plane's containment unit to notify S.H.I.E.L.D. of Izel's location.\n\n====Keller====\nKeller (portrayed by [[Lucas Bryant]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who becomes Yo-Yo's secondary love interest while Mack is busy. After he gets possessed by a Shrike and starts to crystallize the area, Yo-Yo had no other choice but to use the same knife that was used on Sarge's previous victim to kill the parasite at the cost of Keller's life.\n\n====Jaco====\nJaco (portrayed by Winston James Francis) is a smart and strong unspecified alien mercenary who is a member of Sarge's group. He was the runt of the litter of his family and wanted to be a baker until his family was \"turned into fertilizer.\" When it came to the fight at Deke Shaw's tech company, Jaco was subdued by Deke and Mack using the Framework simulation. After pretending to have died from being unable to breath Earth's atmosphere, Jaco revealed his fire-breathing abilities before Daisy knocked him out. After helping to rescue FitzSimmons from Izel's ship, Jaco sacrifices his life to blow up the Lazy Comet with Sarge's nuke.\n\n====Snowflake====\nSnowflake (portrayed by [[Brooke Williams]]) is spacey yet lethal woman who is a member of Sarge's group and has a fascination with death and resurrection. She later falls in love with Deke after being abandoned by Sarge, who put his revenge over her safety.

When it came to the fight at Deke Shaw's tech company, Pax was hit with an Icer. During a mission to take on Izel aboard her ship following the hijacking of Zephyr One, Pax is pushed face first into a Shelter Charge (a force field generating device Sarge brought) by Yo-Yo. While Jaco wanted to get him medical attention, Sarge chose to shoot him, believing he was slowing him down in his pursuit for revenge.\n\n====Malachi====\nMalachi (portrayed by Christopher James Baker) is a Chronicom hunter from Chronyca-2 who targets Fitz and answers to Atarah. He wields special chakrams that enable him to teleport anywhere. During a fight between the Chronicom hunters and Quake on Kitson, Malachi makes off with Fitz after he briefly reunited with Simmons. When Atarah starts to get impatient with FitzSimmons not being able to solve time travel, Malachi, Atarah, and the Chronicoms with them are disabled by Enoch, who takes Malachi's chakrams to teleport himself, Fitz, and Simmons away. Malachi later turns down Baal-Gad's offer to hunt down Fitz and Simmons; revealing that they have a copy of their brains in the Cerebral Fusion Machine. After acquiring the information he needed, Malachi recommends to Atarah that they establish a Chronyca-3, but she's adamant that Chronyca-2 can be still be saved. Malachi responds by shooting her and ordering his fellow Chronicoms to hunt down two targets. This leads him to reassigning all Chronicom anthropologists to hunters and lead a siege on the Lighthouse. Though Enoch managed to save Fitz, Simmons, and those with them, Malachi was able to take the Lighthouse and Fury's black box.\n\n====Izel====\nIzel (portrayed by [[Karolina Wydra]]) is a mysterious, red-haired, non-corporeal alien mercenary who buys Fitz, Simmons, and Enoch from Mr. Kitson so they could help her on a mission to Earth to find her Di'Allas (the monoliths the S.H.I.E.L.D. team encountered in the past). She is later revealed to be the creator of the Shrikes and has been targeted by Sarge ever since she eliminated his family. After the destruction of her ship, Izel starts possessing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in order to access Mack; resulting in Sarge getting shot and Davis' death. After recovering and healing, Sarge broke free and confronts Izel where the Gravitonium generator holding the Di'Allas' energies is. Sarge was left confused when Izel claims that he is from a non-corporeal world like her and that the \"family\" is Coulson's memories of his team. When she emerges from the room, Yo-Yo throws herself in front of Daisy to keep her from being possessed. Mack agrees to go along with Izel to keep her from causing more S.H.I.E.L.D. casualties and to protect Yo-Yo. Upon getting information about a specific temple from Benson, Izel keeps Mack and Yo-Yo around to help her rebuild the three Di'Allas; using their energies to manifest a clone of Flint from their memories. She possesses him and recreates the Di'Allas. Afterwards, she possesses Yo-Yo to break Flint's leg. When Izel was confronted by Sarge, he was unable to kill her, stabbed May, and sent her to the other side of the portal as a sign. Due to the nature of Izel's world, May was able to prevent the ritual from that end, causing Izel to fight May. After briefly making it back to Earth, Izel finds Sarge fighting Mack and Daisy. Once May appeared and impaled Izel with the sword, the remaining Shrike melted into goo freeing those who were possessed.\n\nIzel is based on the Mayan Goddess [[Ixchel]] from the comics and Mayan mythology.\n\n==Guest characters==\nThe following is a supplementary list of guest stars that appear in lesser roles, make significant [[cameo appearances]] or who receive co-starring credit over multiple appearances.

Following his death in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Fury resurrected Coulson using T.A.H.I.T.I., and had his memories of the project replaced. Coulson puts together a team of agents, and they travel the world dealing with strange new cases. During this time, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier#Plot|is revealed to have]] infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to the latter's demise. Fury makes Coulson the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and tasks him with rebuilding the agency \"the right way\". Coulson becomes romantically involved with Rosalind Price, the leader of an anti-[[Inhumans|Inhuman]] government taskforce, until her death at the hands of Grant Ward, one of Coulson's former agents. He gets revenge by crushing Ward's chest with his prosthetic hand. Following [[Captain America: Civil War#Plot|the signing of]] the [[Registration acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]], S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized, with the still officially dead Coulson replaced as director. In the Framework virtual reality, Coulson teaches about the dangers of Inhumans. It is later discovered that Phil Coulson is dying due to the side effect of having Ghost Rider in him during the final battle with Aida. Following the final battle with the gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, Coulson retires to live out his last days on Tahiti with May.\n\n[[File:Clark Gregg WonderCon 2016.png|thumb|right|upright|Clark Gregg]]\nPhil Coulson was created for ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'';<ref name=\"April2006Variety\" /><ref name=\"FergusOstbyIM\" /> he was the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent introduced in the MCU, and was portrayed by Gregg, who went on to play the character in several other MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]].<ref name=\"OneShots\" /> At the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]], Gregg was announced to be starring as Coulson in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', despite the character dying in ''The Avengers''.\"<ref name=\"NYCC2012\" /> In April 2013, Gregg said that he had found creator [[Joss Whedon]]'s explanation for Coulson's resurrection \"fascinating\" and \"true to the world of the comics and mythology in general\".<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> On whether the resurrected Coulson would be the same as before he died, Gregg said \"I think if he hadn\u2019t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn\u2019t be any good.\"<ref name=\"GreggScreenRantApr2013\" /> After Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said \"He kind of got his dream job that I don\u2019t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given ... it\u2019s going to require him to move a little bit in the direction of a more pragmatic figure like Nick Fury\".<ref name=\"GreggRebuilding\" /> Discussing Coulson's character progression through three seasons, executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] said, \"First season Coulson would have beat Ward up and then thrown him over his shoulder and brought him back to Earth and locked him away. Season two Coulson would have defeated him and left him there on the other planet to fend for himself,\" while season three Coulson paused while a portal to Earth was closing to take the time to kill Ward.<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" /> Speaking to the final episode of season five, which sees Coulson retires to live out his last days on Tahiti, Gregg said, \"My understanding is that Phil Coulson is no longer alive. He's been brought back, he's been really clear that he didn't want supernatural measures used again. I always felt like he thought almost like he wasn't supposed to be here... I don't think there is a real buy back for the fact that this deal he made with the Ghost Rider is killing his body.\" Gregg also noted he was talking with the series showrunners about appearing in some form in the sixth season, as there had been some interest in including him.<ref name=\"GreggTHRMay2018\" />\n\n====Sarge / Pachakutiq====\nSarge (portrayed by Clark Gregg) is a man who looks like Phil Coulson; even having the same D.N.A. He leads a group of mercenaries consisting of Jaco, Pax, and Snowflake to Earth on a mission involving targeting people possessed by alien parasites. Then they raided Deke Shaw's tech company to target Deke himself, which ends with Sarge and Snowflake making off with May while Jaco and Pax are apprehended. After being forced to kill another parasite-infected person, May learns that Sarge is a long-lived alien who has been leading his group in hunting the parasites called Shrikes, which have been decimating worlds on behalf of their creator, and that Sarge intends to stop them once and for all. May overpowers Sarge and Snowflake, commandeers their vehicle, and drives back to the Lighthouse. While he and his group are in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Sarge reveals that the Shrikes' creator, Izel, has destroyed his planet and his family; leading him onto his path of revenge. Following his failed attempt to blow up the Shrike tower and take on Izel's ship, Sarge is detained by S.H.I.E.L.D. May appears in his cell and shoots him while possessed by Izel. After recovering and healing, Sarge broke free from his restraints and confronts Izel where the Gravitonium generator holding the powers of the Di'Allas is. Sarge is left confused when Izel claims that he is from a non-corporeal world like her and that the \"family\" is Coulson's memories of his team. Sarge then remembers that his real name is Pachakutiq and how he is merely possessing a clone body of Coulson which was created by the powers of the Di'Allas and sent hundred years into the past on his and Izel's home planet. Despite this, he still believes Izel's his enemy, though he unknowingly starts to manifest powers. After being confronted by Daisy and fully realizing his powers, it's revealed traces of Coulson lie inside Sarge and that he wants to die before he hurts anyone else. When it came to the fight with Izel, Sarge remembers who and what he is and stabs May with his sword while sending her to the other side as a sign. He then fought Mack and Daisy where his true form was revealed. Once May returned from the other side and stabbed Izel with the sword, Daisy stunned him with her abilities so Mack could destroy Pachakutiq with his sword.\n\n====Phil Coulson (Chronicom L.M.D.)====\nFollowing the deaths of Izel and Sarge, Enoch and the Chronicoms on his side were able to create a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) enhanced with Chronicom technology. He was created with all of Coulson's memories, as if he didn't miss anything, and will help deal with the Chronicom hunters led by Malachi.\n\n=== Melinda May ===\n{{Main|Melinda May}}\nMelinda Qiaolian May (portrayed by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. ace pilot and weapons expert who is called \"the Cavalry\", against her wishes, after a mission to [[Bahrain]] where she saved an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team from a rogue gifted\u2014unbeknownst to S.H.I.E.L.D., she did this by killing a young girl named Katya Belyakov. Still struggling to move past this event years later, May agrees to watch her old friend and partner Coulson for Fury, reporting to the latter and looking for potential side-effects of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. in the former. When Coulson becomes the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., May acts as his second-in-command, and over time begins to move past the events of Bahrain and even develop familial relationships with characters such as [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]]. In the Framework, May did not kill Belyakov and becomes a top operative within Hydra. Following the fight against the gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, May joins Coulson on his final days on Tahiti. In season six, she assists in dealing with threats involving Sarge's group and Izel. She gets stabbed by Sarge and sent to the other side where she prevents three of Izel's people from unleashing their kind. After getting back to Earth, she killed Izel and collapsed from her injuries. Simmons arrives and places May in the same pod that contained Fitz' body so that she can recuperate.\n\n[[File:Ming-Na Wen by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ming-Na Wen]]\nWen was cast as May in October 2012.<ref name=\"Oct2012MingNa\" /> Whedon had the character, who was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets,<ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /> \"rolling around in his head\" for a long time.<ref name=\"WenHitFix\" /> In preparation for the role, Wen was \"given a couple of background stories\" about May, but found it challenging to play a character who is respected by those around her when the audience doesn't know why, stating \"It's a challenge in different ways....I use some of my own personal experience where we've been scarred or we've been greatly disappointed\".<ref name=\"WenHitFix\" /> When May's past was revealed in \"[[Melinda (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Melinda]]\", Wen called it \"devastating\", explaining \"She was married, she was in love with Andrew, she had a job that she excelled at and loved and believed in\u2014so her world was pretty perfect...To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many...I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat.\"<ref name=\"WenMelinda\" /> May's shirt is the same blue as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in ''The Avengers'' such as [[Maria Hill]], so as to have some continuity between her uniform and those established in the films. The rest of her costume is inspired by military flight suits, including a leather vest, and pants with stretch panels to aid with fighting.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" />\n\nFollowing the series premiere, Wen teased the character, saying that \"she's very much the observer, and whenever she wants to put in her two cents, it's something that you want to listen to and kind of pay attention to...She's slow in getting acclimated to part of the group and being in the field again.\"<ref name=\"WenZap2it\" /> Talking about May's reasons for staying with S.H.I.E.L.D., Wen explained \"May\u2019s friendship and...loyalty and her love for Coulson [keeps her there]. Maybe not romantic [love], it\u2019s just really\u2014it\u2019s hard to describe\u2014it\u2019s a bond, it\u2019s unbreakable, and she will watch over Coulson and take care of him and help him through whatever he needs to at this point in his life... She wants to be there for him, and if it serves S.H.I.E.L.D., that\u2019s just more or less a side effect, really.\"<ref name=\"WenRebuilding\" /> Wen admitted that May develops a relationship with Skye over the course of the series, going from thinking of Skye as \"someone that she didn\u2019t want as part of the team and didn\u2019t understand why Coulson wanted her\" to wanting Skye \"to be the best agent that she can be.\" After discovering that Skye is an Inhuman, Wen stated that \"it\u2019s like when you have your child or your daughter losing control or getting involved with situations or people that you\u2019re not sure about. You don\u2019t have the control anymore. It\u2019s very frightening. For Skye to be an unknown entity, May still holds out hope. She hopes that her training with her will help her be able to control her new powers, but you never know. Sometimes the power overtakes everything else.\"<ref name=\"WenSkyeInhuman\" />\n\nOn how May deals with her ex-husband Andrew becoming the Inhuman killer Lash, Wen said, \"She's come to the understanding that it was something he had no control over. The betrayal might be not sharing that information of what happened to him with her. I think she understands that, in a way, he was scared and trying to be protective of their relationship and doing it all for the wrong reasons. I think, ultimately, Agent May is kind of shut down when it comes to Lash and Andrew at this point. That's why she's re-focusing all her energy back into S.H.I.E.L.D., back being by Coulson's side. That's where she's most comfortable.\"<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" /> Wen went on to describe May as \"unconventionally maternal...she's taking care of Simmons and really believing that she needs to be able to protect herself, she's very, very concerned about the family's well being.\"<ref name=\"CBRTakingCharge\" />\n\nWen received nominations for 'Favorite Actress in a New TV Series' at the [[40th People's Choice Awards]] and 'Favorite Female TV Star \u2013 Family Show' at the [[2016 Kids' Choice Awards|29th Kids' Choice Awards]].<ref name=\"40thPeoplesChoice\" /><ref name=\"29thKidsChoice\" /> Wen was also named [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of April 12, 2015, for her performance in \"Melinda\", specifically her portrayal of May in the flashback sequences.<ref name=\"WenTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n===Grant Ward===\n{{main|Grant Ward (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\nGrant Douglas Ward (portrayed by [[Brett Dalton]]), the son of politicians, was abused by his parents and older brother Christian growing up. After attempting to kill Christian by burning their house down, Grant meets [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]], a Hydra double agent within S.H.I.E.L.D., who trains Grant to be a skilled agent. Later being assigned to Coulson's team, Grant is outed as Hydra when that organization is revealed to the world, and, after the death of Garrett, becomes a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D. In love with his former teammate Skye, Grant escapes custody, apparently kills Christian and their parents, and infiltrates Hydra so Skye can meet her father. Despite this, Skye turns on Ward and shoots him, and he escapes only with the help of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Kara Palamas, with whom he develops a romantic relationship. He accidentally kills Palamas while she is in disguise as May, and blaming S.H.I.E.L.D., decides to take over the now leader-less Hydra. Joining forces with one of Hydra's previous leaders, Gideon Malick, Ward travels through a portal to an alien planet in search of the ancient Inhuman [[Hive (comics)|Hive]], but is killed there by Coulson. This allows Hive to use Ward's body as a host.\n\nIn the Framework created by [[Holden Radcliffe]], he is Johnson's boyfriend and fellow Hydra agent. He is revealed to still be a double agent, now working for the Inhuman resistance, due to his recruitment by [[Victoria Hand]].\n\n[[File:Brett Dalton at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Brett Dalton]]\nDalton was cast in November 2012.<ref name=\"Dalton\" /> From the conception of the series it was decided that Grant Ward would be a traitor, with executive producer [[Jed Whedon]] saying \"since [the events of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' are] an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /><ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Ward's initial costumes were inspired by [[Jason Bourne]] and [[Ethan Hunt]], with his look based purely in function and with a muted color palette to reflect his serious attitude.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> After Ward was outed as Hydra and became a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D., Dalton grew a beard for the character, explaining that S.H.I.E.L.D. would not provide a prisoner with a razor, \"so it just happens to work out that I have a beard and beards can have a sort of evil connotation.\"<ref name=\"DaltonRebuilding\" /> Austin Lyon portrays a young Ward.<ref name=\"Lyon\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=I think what I was given was just a huge opportunity to play somebody who is more complex, more interesting, more dangerous, scarier in a way that Ward wasn\u2019t. I get to play two different characters in a way.|source=\u2014Dalton on being informed of his character's double agent status.<ref name=\"DaltonReveal\" />}}\nDalton has described Ward as he first appeared in the series as \"a guy who is very trustworthy and rolled up his sleeves and did all the heavy lifting and didn\u2019t really question authority. You know, a by-the-book risk assessor\". Although it was eventually revealed that Ward was a Hydra imposter, Dalton noted that that doesn't necessarily mean the relationships the character built with his S.H.I.E.L.D. team weren't genuine, since going undercover meant letting his guard down to make the other characters trust him, opening himself up to those relationships despite his ulterior motives.<ref name=\"DaltonReveal\" />\n\nFollowing the death of Garrett, the question was asked, \"Who is [Grant Ward] without someone telling him what to do?\" Dalton answered that \"he can follow commands really well. He can do and make tough choices and he can sometimes do unpleasant things in the name of something that he feels he believes in. But...I don\u2019t think that Ward knows the answer to that question himself.\" Dalton called the character a 'wildcard', since he was loyal to Garrett as a father figure rather than Hydra, \"and he was more about his teammates rather than the team\",<ref name=\"DaltonRebuilding\" /> later elaborating that \"It\u2019s not quite good guy, it\u2019s not quite bad guy. It\u2019s not trying to get in with S.H.I.E.L.D. again, it\u2019s not trying to get in with Hydra. He\u2019s really on his own path. He\u2019s living by his code at this particular point in life.\"<ref name=\"DaltonEWOct2014\" /> Explaining Ward's relationship with Palamas, Dalton stated <blockquote>When they first started this relationship, I thought they\u2019re two people who have experienced something similar by following orders and then finding themselves not knowing who they are when someone\u2019s not telling them what to do....But it really [has] developed into something that\u2019s much more complicated than that. There\u2019s a teacher-student relationship there as well as what seems like a genuinely romantic relationship. You see us really lovey-dovey in the cockpit and it\u2019s making everybody around us sick. In some ways, we have the most healthy relationship out of all of the other dynamics on the show, which is saying something because Ward is not a lovey-dovey kind of guy. That\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s now in probably the most stable relationship there is.<ref name=\"DaltonHalfDozen\" /></blockquote> When Ward accidentally kills Palamas in the season two finale, Dalton said that \"This affects him in a way that is deep and lasting. There was a shred of humanity in there, and always the possibility and the thought that he could be redeemed...After Kara\u2019s death\u2014that is actually at my hands\u2014after all the time and effort and energy that\u2019s been invested in this relationship, it turns him. You see it in his eyes....This whole thing of closure keeps coming up over and over again. There is so much closure out there in the world that needs to be achieved. There\u2019s a lot of unfairness that he wants to fix, so we see somebody who is determined, who knows who he is, and is like, 'Fine, if you want to call me the bad guy, I\u2019m the bad guy.'\"<ref name=\"DaltonS2Finale\" />\n\nSpeaking about the monologue Ward gives in \"[[Maveth]]\", Dalton noted that some viewers thought Ward sounded like \"a born-again, devout, off-my-rocker person at that point\", but Dalton felt that it was \"a real moment for Ward where he actually gets a sense of there's something greater than revenge and all of these smaller emotions; there's actually something that's bigger out there that he's a part of.\"<ref name=\"DaltonIGNMaveth\" /> Following Ward's death later in the episode, Bell discussed whether the writers ever considered redeeming the character, saying, \"No character is too high to fall or too low to be redeemed, theoretically....but for someone to be redeemed, they need to ask forgiveness, or want to be redeemed....[Ward] never felt like he needed to apologize for what he did.\"<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" /> Dalton returned to the series in the fourth season to portray Ward in the Framework.<ref name=\"DaltonS4\" /> Dalton felt returning to the character in this capacity allowed him to \"finally get to have the hero arc that Grant Ward deserves.\"<ref name=\"DaltonWonderCon2017\" />\n\nDalton won for 'Male Breakout Star' at the [[2014 Teen Choice Awards]].<ref name=\"2014TeenChoice\" /> The character of Grant Ward garnered a fan following, with a group known as the \"Ward Warriors\" often using the [[hashtag]] \"StandWithWard\" on social media. Dalton was surprised that people \"seem to be standing with Ward no matter what he does....there are people out there who just seem to be following this character wherever he goes. I think that\u2019s brilliant....There isn\u2019t any character like him on the show, and I would say even within the Marvel canon.\" As a \"shoutout\" to these fans, Palamas says, \"I will always stand with Ward\" in the second-season finale, which Dalton called \"a testament to the fans, this incredibly loyal fanbase that has now influenced the script of our show.\"<ref name=\"StandByWard\" />\n\n===Hive===\n{{further|Hive (comics)}}\nHive (from {{lang-la|Alveus}}) is one of the first Inhumans, a parasite who can connect with and control the minds of other Inhumans and feed off of or possess humans. Created by the Kree from a [[Mayan people|Mayan]] hunter (portrayed by Jason Glover) to lead their Inhuman army against mankind, Hive ultimately incited a rebellion, uniting humans and Inhumans to drive the Kree from Earth. Soon, a faction of Hive's followers who feared his power banished him through a portal to the planet Maveth, where he destroyed an entire civilization over centuries. He eventually only survived on human sacrifices sent through the portal by followers, and their descendants, still loyal to him\u2014Hydra. Hive escapes back through the portal in modern times by possessing the body of Grant Ward. He retains the memories of all the bodies he has inhabited, including now Hydra leader Gideon Malick's brother Nathaniel, and punishes Gideon for causing Nathaniel's sacrifice by murdering his daughter Stephanie, before taking control of Johnson, who Ward was in love with, and using her to kill Gideon. Hive then takes steps to recreate the original Kree experiment that made him, planning to use a warhead to spread a pathogen around the world and transform all humans into [[Inhumans#Alpha Primitives|Primitive Inhumans]]. He is destroyed when S.H.I.E.L.D. traps him in a quinjet with the warhead and detonates it in space.\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=What's so great about [Ward] is, he started off as one of the good guys, as one of the original team.

So there\u2019s still an aspect of the man we came to love to hate in there, but we wanted to give it some extra juice and we wanted to give Brett one more challenge where he has to change his character.\"<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" />\n\n[[File:Hive Agents of Shield.png|thumb|left|Hive's true form, as portrayed by Dalton through motion capture]]\nDalton aimed to emulate [[Meryl Streep]]'s character in ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', who never spoke above \"a conversational level...She didn't pound on her chest and make sure everybody knew that she's powerful, she just was.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHiveStreep\" /> Dalton also changed his voice to represent the memories of Will Daniels and Nathaniel Malick \"just a little bit. I tried to change my voice in there, I tried to change even my level of expression in there because I was supposed to be channeling somebody else entirely coming through.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHivePlans\" /><ref name=\"Hive318\" /> Dalton called the coat that Hive wears later in the third season \"iconic and timeless\", noting that \"fashion wasn't on the forefront of [Ward's] mind\", while Hive is more theatrical, \"colorful without having to do much.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHiveStreep\" />\n\nHive's ultimate goal is \"connection\", with Dalton saying, \"all these Inhumans have a purpose. Hive finds his purpose has to do with somehow connecting all of the Inhumans. What we see is Hive's attempt to fulfill what he thinks is his destiny...this desperate need to connect.<ref name=\"DaltonHiveDestiny\" /> Gregg called Hive \"the perfect villain for this show because he carries with him the memories, desire, hatreds and agendas of Will and of Grant Ward. At the same time, he\u2019s got a much deeper, bigger agenda that\u2019s thousands of years old, and gave birth to Hydra.\"<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" /> Dalton described him as a \"survivor\" who \"does not think small. This person has been around for way too long to think in anything other than global terms.\" He saw this as a fundamental difference between the character and Ward, who \"just becomes single minded and is hellbent on one thing at a time....Hive is the opposite. He sees every move on the chess board. That's what we're seeing in terms of Hive's thinking. It is about a new world order of sorts.\" On how much influence the memories of those whose bodies Hive inhabits have on the character, Dalton said, \"It's the motivations...you're seeing a flash of it. It's almost like seeing your kid. There are flashes of you in there...but then again, it's not me.\"<ref name=\"DaltonHivePlans\" />\n\nDalton realized that Hive would not be on the show for long when he took the part, with \"the big, big bad\" less likely to last as long as an \"anti-hero\" like Ward.<ref name=\"HiveDeathEW\" /> On Hive's final scene in the third-season finale, Dalton noted that there would have been no point in the character doing anything other than reflect: \"It's like looking into a fire. Somehow the truth comes out. You're looking at the Earth, man. It's so far away. And you'll get a perspective on things. For Hive, he was trying to change that entire thing and everyone who was on there....I think there's a great deal of remorse [that he was not] able to achieve that connection and do all the things that [he] wanted to do. But there was also an acceptance.\"<ref name=\"HiveDeathIGN\" />\n\n===Daisy \"Skye\" Johnson / Quake===\n{{further|Daisy Johnson}}\nDaisy Johnson (portrayed by [[Chloe Bennet]]) was born in China to [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Calvin Johnson]] and his [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] wife Jiaying, but was soon taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and raised as an orphan by nuns. Taking the name \"Skye\", she became a skilled [[hacktivist]], opposing organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D. This led to her involvement with Coulson, who decided to recruit her, and have Ward, and then May, train her to be a formidable field agent. After reuniting with her father, Skye chooses to drive him away, knowing him to be a monster and murderer, though his wishes for her to fulfill her destiny\u2014by unlocking her Inhuman abilities\u2014are granted when she unintentionally comes into contact with the [[Terrigen Mists]], which give her earthquake-generating abilities. Skye soon meets Jiaying, who helps Skye control her abilities. Skye's loyalties are tested when Jiaying attempts to start a war with S.H.I.E.L.D., and she ultimately sides with S.H.I.E.L.D. Now using her birth name, Johnson forms a S.H.I.E.L.D. team of Inhumans named the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]. After briefly being connected to Hive, and watching Lincoln Campbell, with whom she developed a romantic relationship, sacrifice himself for her, Johnson leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes known as the powered vigilante \"Quake\" to the public. She later returns to S.H.I.E.L.D. following the fight with Eli Morrow.\n\n[[File:Chloe Bennet by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chloe Bennet]]\nDaisy Johnson was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Gabriele Dell'Otto]] for ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' #2.<ref name=\"DaisyCreators\" /> When the character of Skye was introduced to the series, it was always intended that she would be the MCU version of Johnson, as executive producer [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] explained, \"there are always the series of clearances, but we always knew we wanted to evolve Skye into something else. Daisy Johnson was the main character that we wanted to go for. We got confirmation on that very early on, so we\u2019ve been on that track ever since.\"<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> Bennet was cast as Skye in December 2012,<ref name=\"Dec2012Bennet\" /> out of more than 400 actresses who auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"Skye400\" /> Unlike the comic version, Skye is an Inhuman; Jed Whedon explained that \"We\u2019ve created a different origin for her...we merged those two ideas together also because there are such rabid fans out there that if we stick to original story points from the comics, they will smell story points from miles away. Those two factors led us to coming up with a different notion of how she got her powers.\"<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> During a [[Long take|single-shot]] fight sequence in \"[[The Dirty Half Dozen]]\", Bennet broke her arm and finished the second season without wearing a cast.<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" />\n\nSkye's initial costume design was intended to keep her relatable, with inspiration coming from [[street fashion|street style]] blogs,<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> but as she became a more experienced S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the second season, she received a more tactical outfit.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> For the third season, Bennet cut her hair to further her character's transformation to Daisy Johnson, as she is portrayed in the comics, though she did not cut her hair as short as her comic counterpart; Bennet explained that \"the comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, [[Miley Cyrus]]-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair.\"<ref name=\"BennetHair\" /> Bennet also received a superhero costume for the third season, again bringing the character closer to the version in the comics.<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> Foley felt that \"one of the most important things was that the symbol be incorporated into her costume but especially onto the gauntlets, And it\u2019s also on the back of her suit, which was a fun little touch that we added. As far as the silhouette, we wanted to stay true to the comics and pay tribute to those original designs. I also wanted to incorporate the gold color that I\u2019ve seen in some of the illustrations of her suit throughout the comics, which is why we have the gold lines that we see on the suit. Finally, for me personally, I wanted a nod to her tactical look from last season, so if you look at the style lines around the top of the costume, you will see that they\u2019re similar to her tactical hood from Season 2.\" The suit was \"made out of printed EuroJersey, which works well for these costumes because it\u2019s a four-way stretch that gives Chloe the ability to move and do her stunts... But there is a lot more leather in her suit than in some of the others.\" [[Legacy Effects]] created Johnson's iconic gauntlets from the comics, making them \"out of flexible materials painted to look like metal\" so as not to injure anyone during stunts.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" />\n\nBennet, talking about Skye's commitment to S.H.I.E.L.D., stated that \"I think at the beginning she came into S.H.I.E.L.D. thinking it was this government-run, CIA-type thing, where they\u2019re not for the people and their motives were not good ones. But throughout the [first] season, being on the team and seeing what was happening, she really got to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. is there. It really is to protect people, and the intention behind the organization is pure....I think she finds a parallel between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Coulson, and I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s committed to it so deeply.\" Elaborating on this, Bennet said \"she\u2019s always had this unspoken bond with Coulson that\u2019s a very father/daughter relationship where clearly the love they have for each other is evident in a very caring way.\"\n\nGoing into the second season, Bennet noted on the character, \"I think she\u2019s always someone who will wear her heart on her sleeve, but I think she\u2019s much smarter about it now, if that makes any sense. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the type of person who can halfass anything, and that includes emotions. If she feels something, she feels something. But she knows how to control it more\".<ref name=\"BennetRebuilding\" /> Talking about the changes to the character after it was revealed that she was Daisy Johnson and an Inhuman, Tancharoen said \"With this discovery will come some consequences, especially in her relationships with everyone around her, specifically Coulson...Needless to say, it\u2019s going to be a very complex, emotional journey for her. We have the ability on a television show to really explore the emotional journey of that. What does that mean now that she has this ability? Does she even want it?\"<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> Explaining some of these changes in the character, Bennet stated that \"I make sure to try to keep the season one Daisy weaved through the new, badass Daisy....[but] she's changed a lot. She went into S.H.I.E.L.D. hating organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., and now she's the epitome of S.H.I.E.L.D. She believes in everything that they believe in.\"<ref name=\"BennetSep2015\" />\n\nDiscussing the character becoming leader of the Secret Warriors, Bennet said, \"What makes her such a good leader is how much she's been through, so she can relate to everyone on the team and she really has so much empathy and that's what I love about playing her. She really genuinely cares about everyone so deeply and it wears heavily on her because she obviously went through this big Inhuman change...And so what I think makes her such a good kind of...unconventional leader is that she's really kind of still learning and I think that's so realistic that leaders are\u2014it's almost like when you grow up and you realize that your parents are just humans, parenting.\" Wen noted how the character \"has evolved from being so anti-establishment into suddenly being someone who wants to create an establishment that would help and enhance the betterment of the world\", to which Bennet said, \"she was lost for a really long time, she was an orphan and she wanted to find her parents and all of a sudden she does and it's not what she expected. You know, when your mom tries to kill you and your dad is Hyde. So she's kind of grown into this.\"<ref name=\"CBRTakingCharge\" />\n\nEntering the fourth season, Bennet felt that, after the events of the final episode of season three, Johnson was \"in a darker place. She's mourning. She cares about the team so much that she feels like she is protecting them by kind of pushing them away, because I think she feel like everything bad happens around her and she can't help but cause problems. Her way of taking care of the people she cares about is kind of pushing them away, which... is not the best thing.\" She also added that physically, Johnson would not be in great shape, since she is no longer under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s monitoring \"containing and helping me grow my powers\" so there would be \"repercussions of her kind of using these powers and... abusing her body\".<ref name=\"BennetCBRJul2016\" />\n\nBennet received nominations for 'Favorite TV Actress' and 'Favorite Female TV Star \u2013 Family Show' at the [[2015 Kids' Choice Awards|28th]] and [[2016 Kids' Choice Awards|29th Kids' Choice Awards]], respectively.<ref name=\"29thKidsChoice\" /><ref name=\"28thKidsChoice\" />\n\n===Leo Fitz===\n{{main|Leo Fitz}}\nLeopold \"Leo\" James Fitz (portrayed by [[Iain De Caestecker]]) is brought on to Coulson's team as an engineering and weapons technology specialist, and provides tech support for the team throughout the first season. He has a close bond with Agent Simmons, the two having graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy together. At the end of the first season he confesses to Simmons that he has romantic feelings towards her, before nearly dying in an attempt to save her. Left with severe brain damage, Fitz struggles with technology and speech, but over time becomes a full member of the team again. When his consciousness is submerged in the Framework, Fitz becomes \"The Doctor\", Hydra's remorseless second-in-command, and has a relationship with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]]. The experience changes him; retaining his memories of this other life, he is haunted by his past actions. During the final battle against a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot, Fitz is buried under a rubble and was found fatally injured when dug out by May and Mack where he succumbs to his wounds. As Daisy and Simmons lead the search for Fitz, Enoch releases Fitz prematurely when they come under attack. Making their way to the planet Kitson, the two of them work to afford a ride off the planet until the casino comes under attack by the Chronicom hunters. Even though Fitz and Simmons reunite, Malachi makes off with Fitz. In order to keep Malachi from killing Fitz, Simmons surrenders herself to Altarah so that the two of them can come up with a time-traveling method to help the Chronicoms go back in time to prevent Chronyca-2's destruction. When the Lighthouse was attacked, Fitz and Simmons were saved by Enoch in Isaiah's body.\n\n[[File:Iain De Caestecker at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Iain De Caestecker]]\nDe Caestecker was cast as Fitz in November 2012.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> Following injuries the character receives at the end of the first season, the series began to deal with brain trauma, as De Caestecker explained \"From the get-go, before I even knew about it, the writers had the idea, and they did a lot of research in it with doctors. When I found out about it, I did my own research and correlated it together. It's just something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing to a lot of people, brain trauma, so we just have to constantly be respectful towards it. We talk about it all the time. Even if you don't see it or it's not obvious, it's always something that's in our heads that we're keeping going. It's the realization that you never get fully better, it's about embracing the new side of you and making that work in the world that you're in. I suppose the idea of a cure\u2014I don't know if that could happen.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2\" /> For Fitz's costume design, Foley tried to have his clothes reflect his personality, without \"getting too clich\u00e9...we try and play up his \"heritage style\"...using classic design details on him like paisley & leather elbow patches and mixing them with different plaids.\"<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" />\n\nDe Caestecker, in describing the character, said that \"Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He\u2019s quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where\u2014I don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn\u2019t really understand emotions as much\".<ref name=\"CaesteckerOnSet\" /> Fitz has a lot of interaction with Simmons in the series, with De Caestecker explaining \"My character, he\u2019s Engineering, so he\u2019s on the computer and tech side of everything. He\u2019s consumed within that world, and he works very closely with Simmons, who\u2019s Biochem. They\u2019ve got this kind of weird chemistry together, and they just kind of fit each other in a very weird way.\"<ref name=\"CaesteckerIGN\" /> Regarding the changing dynamic over time between Fitz and Simmons, De Caestecker said \"I suppose what's happened from the start of season two up to midseason is, they've become a lot stronger as individuals, I think. But I think they still care for and need each other a lot, and they also work better together when they are together. But I think there's a lot of things that have still been unsaid and will hopefully come out, certain confrontations that are still bubbling under.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2\" />\n\nDe Caestecker was named [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of September 27, 2015, for his performance in \"[[Laws of Nature (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Laws of Nature]]\", particularly the episode's final scene.<ref name=\"DeCaesteckerTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n=== Jemma Simmons ===\n{{Main|Jemma Simmons}}\nJemma Anne Simmons (portrayed by [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]) is brought on to Coulson's team as a life sciences (both human and alien) specialist, and has a close bond with Agent Fitz, the two having graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy together. She grows to mistrust all things alien and superhuman, but shows her loyalty to Coulson despite this when they are faced with the rival S.H.I.E.L.D. faction. Following the fight against the Inhumans, Simmons is absorbed by the [[Kree]] monolith, a portal to the alien planet Maveth. There she falls in love with Will Daniels, who sacrifices himself so she can return to Earth. Simmons eventually moves on from Daniels and begins a relationship with Fitz. After Fitz was killed, Simmons partook in the mission to find the preserved body that Enoch had. Even though Fitz and Simmons reunite, Malachi makes off with Fitz. In order to keep Malachi from killing Fitz, Simmons surrenders herself to Altarah so that the two of them can come up with a time-traveling method to help the Chronicoms go back in time to prevent Chronyca-2's destruction. When the Lighthouse was attacked, Fitz and Simmons were saved by Enoch in Isaiah's body. Simmons then uses the same pod to save May's life as she has the Di'Allis samples taken and the temple destroyed. After a jump, the Zephyr arrives at the top of the Empire State Building where she mentions that the Chronicoms wanted to establish Chronyca-3 and also reveals that Enoch used a combination of Life Model Decoy technology and Chronicom technology to create an advanced LMD of Phil Coulson.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Henstridge - PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Elizabeth Henstridge]]\nHenstridge was also cast in November 2012.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> She described her character as \"a biochem expert. She\u2019s young and hungry and she\u2019s a great woman to play because she\u2019s intelligent and focused and curious and she doesn\u2019t apologize for it. She\u2019s got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeCrave\" /> After the reveal during the [[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|season two premiere]] that Fitz was just imagining Simmons in the episode, Henstridge explained that the showrunners \"tell you what you need to know to act your scenes, but anything after that, you never know.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeHydra\" /> For Simmons' costume design, Foley tried to have her clothes reflect her personality, without \"getting too clich\u00e9...we mix the hard with the soft\u2014we combine the feminine elements like peter pan collars, silk blouses and florals with the masculine touches like ties\".<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> Ava Marielle portrays a younger Simmons.\n\nHenstridge talked about the characters of Fitz and Simmons being separated over the course of the series, noting that they have \"never been without each other. When you see them without each other, that brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters in discovering what it's like to have to be independent\".<ref name=\"HenstridgeTVGuide\" /> On Simmons' guilt over Fitz's brain damage, Henstridge said \"She feels a huge amount of guilt. There\u2019s a lot of emotions happening. A lot of it revolves around Fitz and Ward. She feels a lot of anger and resentment at the situation. When something catastrophic happens to someone you love, or a situation arises that affects people you love the most, if that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in that position, you never really know what to do.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeHydra\" /> As this relationship developed through the second season, Henstridge said, \"I don't think they fully realize the implication of how far apart they are. There's so much hurt there. I don't think they realize what they're sacrificing by not figuring this out.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> Talking about the harsher side of Simmons seen later in the second season, after the reveal of the Inhumans and the subsequent death of Agent Triplett, Henstridge explained that at the beginning of the series, Simmons was \"very mathematical\" but throughout the first season \"understood that it was more about human relationships and what it means to save someone's life\". Now, \"she's had a traumatic event and she's gone straight back to what she knows of trying to make everything black and white\", and so \"It makes sense [to her] if there are these people\u2014call them what you want; Inhumans\u2014that cause destruction, and you can get rid of them, then they won't be {{sic|a destruction}} anymore....Of course it isn't\" that simple.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" />\n\nAfter Simmons is trapped on the planet Maveth for six months, she becomes \"profoundly different\", with Henstridge describing her as \"definitely still her essence\u2014she doesn\u2019t just completely change. But she\u2019s been through so much. She\u2019s hardened. She\u2019s had to face things that she never would\u2019ve imagined, also by herself without Fitz, so she\u2019s definitely changed, stronger and kind of damaged.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsEW301\" /> Describing the relationship that Simmons develops with Daniels on the planet, and comparing it to that with Fitz, Henstridge said, \"It's very visceral. It's more primal and intense. That just comes from having to survive in a hostile environment, only having each other on the whole planet. The stakes are always so high, so it's more physical than her relationship with Fitz. FitzSimmons is a slow burn that's taken years and years, and they connected over intellect, whereas her and Will, it's an \"us against the world\" kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsTHR305\" /> After Daniels dies and Simmons eventually moves on with Fitz, the latter two are shown consummating their relationship after several seasons worth of build up. \"We imagine they spend the morning after laughing a lot about what just happened,\" said Whedon and Tancharoen, \"We want their relationship to feel like their friendship did, because all the best relationships are just that. So moving forward, while this change in their friendship would hopefully only deepen their connection, it is bound also to make things a bit more complicated.\"<ref name=\"FitzSimmonsSex\" />\n\nHenstridge was named [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of October 25, 2015, for her performance in \"[[4,722 Hours]]\", particularly for carrying the episode herself.<ref name=\"HenstridgeTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n===Lance Hunter===\n{{further|Lance Hunter}}\nLance Hunter (portrayed by [[Nick Blood]]), an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] lieutenant turned mercenary, joins post-Hydra S.H.I.E.L.D. at the request of Coulson following a recommendation from his ex-wife [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]]. Despite a tumultuous relationship with Morse, Hunter becomes a full-time S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, and risks his life to save her when she is kidnapped. Following an incident in Russia involving the near-assassination of Prime Minister Olshenko, Hunter and Morse decide to disavow themselves from S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect Coulson and the team. Hunter continues doing mercenary work, with Fitz eventually reaching out for Hunter to free him from General Hale's base while posing as a lawyer.

Generally I think they\u2019re slightly wary, a little bit suspicious, [but also] a little bit amused by him. Because the nice thing about him coming into this group is that Lance doesn\u2019t really care that much of what people think of him. So he\u2019s very much himself and very comfortable in it. He doesn\u2019t bow down to the etiquette of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy.\"<ref name=\"BloodSep2014\" />\n\nTalking about Hunter's integration into the team following an offer from Coulson to become a full-time agent, Blood said, \"I feel Hunter probably feels very independent, still, so I don't think he would like to admit that he's not an outsider, that he's a part of it....He doesn't have too much respect for authority and titles, particularly in this world, but I think he takes each decision as it comes. If Coulson does something he respects, that's all good. If he doesn't, he's going to say something. But I think he sees that [Coulson is] trying to do the right thing, and he's got a lot of respect for him in that sense\". Also, on Hunter's on-again, off-again relationship with Morse, Blood said, \"I think the dynamic's great. I think it's really good and there is a lot of truth in it of those relationships you have where it's kind of, \"can't live with each other, can't kill each other,\" and that sort of thing.\"<ref name=\"BloodPalickiRocky\" /> After Hunter kills a man in \"[[A Wanted (Inhu)man]]\", Blood said, \"I think that\u2019s probably newer for the audience than it is for Hunter. I think Hunter, in his past, has probably done some morally questionable acts....not to say he\u2019s ever been a vicious, vindictive, or immoral person.

He doesn\u2019t necessarily have access to all the bells-and-whistles and gadgetry that S.H.I.E.L.D. did, so he has to use his charm and his wit to break down doors, and call in a few favors from his dodgy friends\".<ref name=\"BloodTVLine\" />\n\n===Bobbi Morse===\n{{further|Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)}}\nBarbara \"Bobbi\" Morse (portrayed by [[Adrianne Palicki]]) is Hunter's ex-wife and an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. A founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" after disobeying Fury's orders to save hundreds of S.H.I.E.L.D. lives, she infiltrates Coulson's group for reconnaissance. Coulson sends her undercover within Hydra, where she gave up the location of Agent 33 rather than risk the lives of many other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. She later agrees, along with her fellow \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" leaders, to combine their faction with Coulson's. Ward then kidnaps her in an attempt to force her to confess to giving up 33 to Hydra, but when Morse is unrepentant, Ward sets a trap for Hunter which will see him killed in front of her. Morse takes the bullet for Hunter, barely surviving.

It had to have a kind of tactical feeling to it too so that it made sense in our universe. She's got rivets that are in the straps across her chest, and those are there as a tribute to the buttons that go down the side of her [most recent comics] costume\". The character's comics costume is traditionally navy blue and white, which was changed to navy blue and grey for the series.<ref name=\"MockingbirdCostumeMarvel\" /> Three sets of the costume were produced; two for Palicki to wear, and one for her stunt double. Foley used \"lots of stretch panels\" and leather to ensure freedom of movement in the character's many action sequences.<ref name=\"MockingbirdCostumeFashionista\" />\n\nWith the reveal of Morse's loyalty to the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction, Palicki explained that the character was \"not doing anything wrong in her [own] eyes...This was a choice she made. She\u2019s been through hell with these people. She does care about Coulson\u2019s team. She\u2019s torn because of Hunter and she has a soft spot for Coulson. But at the end of it, she really is a true soldier and she feels there has been a compromise and she needs to take care of it.\"<ref name=\"PalickiEWrS\" /> Bell, in response to a question on whether Morse had more secrets than those revealed during the second season, stated that \"she and Hunter have been keeping secrets from one another, evidently for years. And one of the things I find interesting about her is she seems to be more of an ideologue\u2014she\u2019s loyal to an idea\u2014and sometimes, the short term of what appears to be betrayal or short term conflict is often because of what she views as the greater good. And that\u2019s an interesting character to have in a world where Coulson is much more \"we need to protect or save that person.\" Are you loyal to a person? Are you loyal to the guy in the bunker next to you? Or are you loyal to the larger concept of what we\u2019re fighting for?\"<ref name=\"MockingbirdPoster\" />\n\nWhen asked about her character potentially appearing in an MCU film, Palicki said \"that was one of the things that was discussed when I was coming on for the part, and you know, we\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s such a nice world that we live in that crossover can happen so often now which in the past it never really did so, to see these worlds come together on the small screen and the big screen is really cool.\"<ref name=\"PalickiCrossover\" /> Palicki left the series following the season three episode \"Parting Shot\" to star in the spin-off show ''Marvel's Most Wanted''.<ref name=\"BellPartingShot\" />\n\nPalicki was named as an honorable mention for [[TVLine]]'s \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of March 20, 2016, for her performance in \"Parting Shot\".<ref name=\"PalickiTVLinePerformer\" />\n\n===Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie===\n{{further|Al MacKenzie}}\nAlphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie (portrayed by [[Henry Simmons]]), a S.H.I.E.L.D. mechanic under Robert Gonzales, is a founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and infiltrates Coulson's group with Morse. After being briefly mind-controlled by Kree technology Mack's distrust in alien and the superhuman is deepened, and he decides to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. when his fellow leaders agree to join forces with Coulson. However, following the war with the Inhumans, Coulson convinces Mack to stay, and places him in charge of all alien materials. Coulson makes Mack acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he goes after Ward and Hydra. In the Framework, Mack's daughter Hope is still alive. After being used by Hydra to reveal Johnson is from the real world, he seeks out the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance to help them. When the exit point from the Framework is found, Mack chooses to stay behind, saying that the time he spent with the Framework version of Hope was real enough for him. He later leaves the Framework when Hope disappears amongst the Framework's collapse. After the death of Coulson, Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n[[File:Henry Simmons by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry Simmons]]\nIn August 2014, Simmons joined the cast as Mack, a recurring character inspired by one that first appeared in ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3.<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the third season.<ref name=\"SimmonsRegular\" />\n\nSimmons described Mack as \"a big guy. That is, he has a big heart, but when it comes down to it and business has to get done, there\u2019s another side of him that gets it done....He wants to make a difference, so that\u2019s why he wants to be a part of this team\". On the different dynamic that a mechanic brings to the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, Simmons said \"I think my guy does have a little bit of a different element, [because] the other people have the stress of the everyday life or death danger situations. Mack doesn\u2019t have that quite yet. He has the stress of getting things done because he wants to contribute, but he\u2019s not out there in the field....They might have their quips and everything, but everything is very serious. I see that my guy brings a little bit of a different color to everything. He has a little bit more humor to him, he\u2019s a little bit more laid back.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsRebuilding\" /> On Mack's stance on violence, Simmons confirmed that \"Mack really is a guy that does not like violence at all, but, when pushed, it\u2019s \"by any means necessary.\" He doesn't enjoy it, but he'll do what he has to do.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsrS\" />\n\nAfter Mack's allegiance to the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction is revealed, and as his distrust of Coulson grew throughout the second season, Simmons spoke of Mack's feelings towards Coulson: \"He respects Coulson. And I think he genuinely likes Coulson. But I think he just believes that Coulson is not the right man for the job....look, I\u2019m loyal, but if the head is going about doing things that really aren\u2019t in our job description, and he\u2019s using us to do things for personal reasons, and then one of my brothers dies because of it? Yeah, I have a problem. And everyone else should, too....when Coulson is in his most crazed state and on the verge of killing Sebastian Derik, no one has ever seen Coulson like that. Skye witnessed it, but she has a different relationship to him; there\u2019s like a father/daughter thing going. So out of the whole team, I was the only one to see him like that, completely out of control. I tried to explain it to Hunter\u2014if that happened in that instant, what\u2019s going to happen when everything is on the line? How is he going to act?\u2014and Hunter kind of brushed it aside. But that\u2019s another reason why Mack is very, very deeply skeptical.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsrS\" />\n\nIn season six, Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Simmons \"love[d] the challenge of being the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" but felt \"the one thing that can hinder Mack\u2019s ability to lead is his reluctance to put the people he loves in the line of danger,\" which leads to \"Mack\u2019s toughest decision as director.\"<ref name=\"MackDirectorS6\" />\n\n===Lincoln Campbell===\nLincoln Campbell (portrayed by [[Luke Mitchell]]) is an Inhuman doctor with the ability to control electric charges. He helps Skye adjust to her new life post-terrigenesis, and his later attempt to protect her from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra leads to his capture and experimentation at the hands of Dr. List. Skye saves his life, and when she turns on Jiaying once realizing her true intentions, Campbell is shortly convinced to do the same. Following Jiaying's death, Campbell attempts to live a normal life, convinced that his Inhuman abilities are a curse, but is hunted by the ATCU and becomes a fugitive. He subsequently joins S.H.I.E.L.D. for protection and to be near Skye\u2014now going by Daisy Johnson and with whom Campbell forms a relationship\u2014and becomes a Secret Warrior. Campbell chooses to sacrifice himself to save the team and the world from Hive's plan by taking Hive and a nuclear warhead to space in a quinjet where the weapon can detonate without affecting Earth.\n\nDaisy mentioned that Lincoln has a sister named Amanda who Daisy sends relief money to.\n\n[[File:Luke Mitchell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Luke Mitchell]]\nMitchell was introduced as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring character, in the second season.<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the third season.<ref name=\"MitchellRegular\" /> Regarding the character's introduction, Bell stated that \"Meeting Luke\u2019s character in the Inhuman world is just setting up a new dynamic. We\u2019re taking Skye into a group with a whole bunch of different people. So far, we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a guy with no eyes, and there\u2019s a woman who now is covered in thorns. And as in the [[X-Men]] world, there are a handful of people who look more like them, but a lot of them turn out to be just attractive people with powers. And we thought, \"Hey, let\u2019s have some of those as well!\" We were looking for a new character to come on, and Luke just really impressed us. He was a good actor, had a nice quality, and we felt he might be a good person to sort of usher Skye into this other world.\"<ref name=\"AfterlifePoster\" />\n\nHeading into season three, Mitchell explained that \"the Lincoln that the audience was introduced to in season two was a side of Lincoln, and that side of Lincoln was not necessarily a lie or the truth or whatever, but we all put on different faces in different environments...I think in that environment Lincoln was very much under the spell of the Inhuman Elders. He played his part in the hierarchy there and he believed in the cause, which then was exposed to be evil. Then in season three, it\u2019s like, wow, how is he dealing with the events in season two?\"<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> On seeing Lincoln's darker side in the third season, Mitchell said, \"I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more of Lincoln\u2019s issues with his past pop up, in particular possibly some anger issues that have been unresolved. They pop their heads up from time to time. Certainly in matters of conflict, in pressure situations\".<ref name=\"IGN10Teasers\" />\n\nOn the relationship that Campbell develops with Johnson, the only person who can \"keep him somewhat in check when it comes to his anger\", Mitchell said, \"he wants to make something of his life, but he doesn\u2019t see anything without Daisy in the picture\", and \"if something were to happen to Daisy, I think Lincoln wouldn\u2019t stay in S.H.I.E.L.D. Daisy is his life. He\u2019ll do anything to get her back.\" This is seen when he agrees to wear a \"murder vest\" as a fail safe, and when he disobeys orders to test an experimental antitoxin on himself\u2014\"Once he does that, and it doesn\u2019t work, then they put him in the containment module for his own benefit, because his immune system is done. It becomes incredibly frustrating.\" Mitchell added, \"He makes these decisions, but you still see the fear in him when he does this. It\u2019s not just bravado....There\u2019s a deep well of emotion in him.\"<ref name=\"MitchellDeathWish\" />\n\nThe episode \"[[Bouncing Back]]\" opens with \"a mysterious flash-forward to three months in the future, showing an unidentified S.H.I.E.L.D. agent seemingly dead in space\",<ref name=\"FlashForward\" /> leading to a \"four-episode event\" for the final episodes of the season, marketed as ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent''.<ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> A poster created by [[Greg Land]] for the event recreated the cover of the \"iconic\" ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #121 that served as the first issue of the story arc \"[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]\",<ref name=\"ASM121Poster\" /> and ahead of the season finale, Marvel released a series of videos that \"memorialized\" each of the potential character who could have been the Fallen Agent.<ref name=\"MemorialVideos\" /> The final episode of the season reveals that it is Campbell who dies, which the executive producers had known going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward.<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" /> Bell said he \"earned it\", adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon explaining that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not \"want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there\u2019s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn\u2019t consider himself a hero. That\u2019s the beauty of the moment\u2014it\u2019s not just for [Daisy], but it is, and it\u2019s not just for him, but it is.\"<ref name=\"EWEPsMay2016\" />\n\n===Holden Radcliffe===\n{{further|Holden Radcliffe}}\n[[File:John Hannah by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Hannah]]\nHolden Radcliffe (portrayed by [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]]) is a transhumanist who believes in the improvement of humanity through enhancement.

After a S.H.I.E.L.D. raid on Hive's base, Radcliffe escapes and agrees to cooperate with Coulson and Talbot. After being acquitted, Radcliffe transfers his [[artificial intelligence]] [[AIDA (comics)|AIDA]] into a [[Life Model Decoy]] (LMD), an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project, which Radcliffe also names Aida. After seeing pages from the ''Darkhold'', Radcliffe begins using his LMDs, including Aida and a decoy of May, to try and take it for himself in an attempt to learn the secret to eternal life. Fearing for his safety, Radcliffe also creates a decoy of himself, and seeks protection from the Watchdogs. Using the ''Darkhold'' and the resources of the Watchdogs' Superior, Racliffe creates an entire digital world within the Framework. Feeling that Radcliffe may one day jeopardize the Framework himself, Aida slits Radcliffe's wrists and uploads his mind to the Framework as his body dies. Within the Framework, his consciousness resided on Ogygia with Agnes in exchange for not interfering with Aida's work as Madame Hydra. After redeeming himself, Holden is deleted amongst the Framework's collapse.\n\nHannah recurred as Radcliffe during the end of the third season,<ref name=\"318Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"Radcliffe\" /> before being promoted to the main cast for the fourth season.<ref name=\"HannahRegular\" /> On Radcliffe transferring his [[artificial intelligence]] AIDA into a Life Model Decoy,<ref name=\"LMD\" /> Whedon said, \"Radcliffe has a good heart, but he's willing to do anything for science. He's excited about the prospect. He said Fitz and Simmons had friends die and maybe they didn't have to. He's clearly opening a box. Whether or not it's Pandora's box, we'll see. He thinks there's something beyond humans.\" Tancharoen added, \"To someone like Radcliffe, he might believe that to be just the next step in human evolution. There are a number of people who are into body modification now, so what does that mean? What's the root of that?\"<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" />\n\nHannah felt portraying Radcliffe was \"quite interesting\", describing him as \"someone who is not the up-down, white-hearted good guy\" but still is not \"a bad guy\". He also noted the fatherly feelings Radcliffe has towards Aida, stating, \"possibly as [their relationship] develops, as she proves there\u2019s almost a paternal... caring and sympathetic way in which that technology has developed self-awareness and how that self-awareness disappoints. A bit like you would with a child, where a child becomes aware of their own limitations, their own lackings. I would say there\u2019s certainly have a very benign kind of deity sense about it \u2013 a benign\u2026not dictatorship about it, but a benign parental way about it.\"<ref name=\"HannahCBRJan2017\" />\n\n===Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez===\n{{further|Yo-Yo Rodriguez}}\n[[File:Natalia Cordova-Buckley by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Natalia Cordova-Buckley]]\nElena Rodriguez (portrayed by [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]]) is a Colombian Inhuman who can move at a super speed for a beat of her heart, before returning to the point she started moving from. She comes into contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. when they investigate her for stealing weapons from the corrupt members of the local police. She grows close to Mack, who nicknames her \"Yo-Yo\", and eventually agrees to join the Secret Warriors. After the signing of the Sokovia Accords, Rodriguez returns to her life with occasional monitoring by S.H.I.E.L.D. Rodriguez later helps Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons to infiltrate the Framework. After Johnson and Simmons are unable to rescue Mack from the Framework, Rodriguez goes in to rescue him.\n\nBy February 2016, Cordova-Buckley was cast as \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez, based on the comic Secret Warrior of the same name.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckley\" /> Cordova-Buckley learned of the role after she had been cast in the series, and subsequently researched the comics for inspiration. She described the character, as she is initially introduced in the series, as a freedom fighter who \"in a lot of ways she wants to help her people in Colombia and she wants to do good with her powers and she makes sure that she\u2019s very adamant on how she goes about things.\" She also noted the rarity of the character's spirituality, saying that she \"has this whole spiritual connection to her powers which is rare to ever see in a super hero movie...She wants to use [her powers] as what she calls a blessing and a gift from God to help others, so it\u2019s a very unique approach to it all\".<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyLatina\" /> When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character.<ref name=\"ThisWeek47\" /> Before the start of the fifth season, it was revealed that Cordova-Buckley had been promoted to series regular.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyMain\" />\n\n===Deke Shaw===\n[[File:Jeff Ward by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeff Ward]]\nDeke Shaw (portrayed by [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]]) is \"the ultimate survivor\" and a \"roguish scavenger\" on the space station Lighthouse in the year 2091. With a sharp mind and quick wit, he has the ability to acquire items for a price.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> During the final battle with Kasius, Enoch and Deke sacrifice their lives to get Phil Coulson's team back to their own time. However, Deke is revealed to have been sent to the present with Coulson and his team and is found and rescued from jail by Daisy under the alias of Sinara Smith. Deke later realizes that he is the grandson of Fitz and Simmons, eventually telling the latter. When a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot was defeated by Daisy, Simmons was unable to find Deke in his room.\n\nIn season six, it's revealed that Deke left S.H.I.E.L.D. to start a [[Technology company|tech company]] that involved using the Framework for a virtual reality video game as well as \"borrowing\" S.H.I.E.L.D. tech to make new innovations. Despite this, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept tabs on him via Agent Trevor Khan, who worked undercover as his partner. He was targeted by Sarge's group, who mistook him for a Shrike carrier due to his strange readings before he was rescued by Mack and May. While helping the S.H.I.E.L.D. team thwart Sarge's plan to nuke Izel's shrikes, Deke fell in love with the latter's associate Snowflake after Sarge abandoned her for the sake of his revenge.\n\nWard was cast in August 2017;<ref name=\"JeffWardCast\" /> his role was announced in November 2017.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> Ward had originally been cast as Virgil, a character who dies in the first episode. During the [[Read-through|table read]] of the episode, the main cast felt Ward \"nailed it\" as Virgil and wanted him to stay on as Deke, who had not yet been cast. The producers reached out to Ward after the reading to audition for Deke, and was ultimately cast in the part.<ref name=\"WardOriginallyVirgil\" />\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2018, it was revealed that Ward had been promoted to a series regular for the sixth season.<ref name=\"WardSeriesRegular\" />\n\n==Recurring characters==\nThe following is a list of guest characters that have recurring roles throughout the series. The characters are listed by the MCU media or season in which they first appeared.\n\n===Introduced in films===\n====Gideon Malick====\nGideon Malick (portrayed by [[Powers Boothe]]) is a former member of the World Security Council and secret leader of Hydra who ascended to power following the death of his father in 1970. Gideon was joined by his brother Nathaniel, but the two soon learned of a trick their father used to avoid being sacrificed to Hive, and when Gideon followed suit, Nathaniel was sacrificed. Gideon successfully opens the portal to allow Hive to return to Earth, but Hive reveals that he has retained Nathaniel's memories, and punishes Gideon by murdering his daughter Stephanie. After being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., Gideon cooperates with Coulson against Hive. Gideon is murdered by Johnson while she is controlled by Hive.\n\nIn October 2015, it was announced that Boothe was joining the series as a recurring character early in the third season, reprising his role from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (where he was credited only as \"World Security Council\").<ref name=\"Boothe\" /><ref name=\"Boothe2\" /> On how much the series would use the character later in the third season, following the midseason finale, Whedon stated that \"we\u2019d be fools not to use him more. We couldn\u2019t be bigger fans of [Boothe's] portrayal of the role. We knew going in that we were going to get some bang for our buck, and we\u2019ve been loving writing the character. We love the way he\u2019s attacking the scenes. We plan on keeping him around, because we\u2019d be idiots not to.\"<ref name=\"WhedonEWDec2015\" /> [[Cameron Palatas]] portrays a young Gideon Malick.<ref name=\"316Synopsis\" />\n\n===Introduced in season one===\n====Mike Peterson / Deathlok====\n{{further|Deathlok|Mike Peterson (comics)}}\nMike Peterson (portrayed by [[J. August Richards]]) is an ordinary man that was artificially enhanced with the [[Extremis]]-containing Centipede serum by Project Centipede. Peterson later joins S.H.I.E.L.D, but is caught in an explosion and awakens without his right leg and under the control of the \"Clairvoyant\", who gives him a bionic prosthetic limb as part of \"Project Deathlok\". After the defeat of Centipede and the \"Clairvoyant\", Peterson works for Coulson covertly, and aids in the take down of Hydra leader Dr. List. Peterson later returned with some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to help Phil Coulson seal the rift in the Lighthouse that was leaking different fears from it. Afterwards, he attended Fitz and Simmons' wedding.\n\nRichards appeared in Joss Whedon's ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' as [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Charles Gunn]] before being cast as Peterson,<ref name=\"RichardsSFX\" /> who was revealed to be the MCU version of Deathlok in January 2014.<ref name=\"DeathlokConfirmed\" /> Created by [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Doug Moench]] in 1974, Deathlok has gone through many different iterations in the comics.<ref name=\"DeathlokComics\" /> Richards called the role \"a dream come true\",<ref name=\"RichardsSFX\" /> and described the character's costume and makeup, which took \"about five departments...two hours to do the makeup and then [about] 15 or 20 minutes to get into the costume\", as \"restrictive. I love the costume and it really helps me to play the character, because it makes me feel part-machine, part-human.\"<ref name=\"RichardsHitFix\" /> The costume also had to be enhanced with visual effects, including the addition of a robotic leg and an arm mounted rocket launcher, as well as a half metal plated skull with robotic eye for when Deathlok is seen with x-ray vision.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> The costume was updated and evolved to be closer to the comic version for Deathlok's appearance in the second season.<ref name=\"RichardsIGNS2\" />\n\nRichards found \"the theme of Deathlok [to be] about deep, internal conflict, and that's what we're bringing with this [version].\"<ref name=\"RichardsMarvel\" /> After returning late in the second season, Richards looked back, and felt that his initial awkwardness and reluctance with the character and the costume reflected Peterson's own journey becoming Deathlok. He also noted that when the character says \"Mike Peterson is dead\", \"the only way that line could have meaning [is] if it were not true. I always think of Mike Peterson being at the core of this character, and whatever happens as a result of that, is all Mike Petersen.\"<ref name=\"RichardsIGNS2\" />\n\n====Ian Quinn====\nIan Quinn (portrayed by [[David Conrad]])<ref name=\"Conrad\" /> is a wealthy industrialist/philanthropist and the CEO of Quinn Worldwide and a former partner of Franklin Hall who is involved with The Clairvoyant. He acquires Deathlok technology for Mike Peterson, and attempts to sell more Deathlok soldiers to the U.S. military. After Garrett is defeated, Quinn is absorbed by the gravitonium by Raina.\n\n====Raina====\n{{For|the subsequent comic book version|Raina (comics)}}\nRaina (portrayed by [[Ruth Negga]]) was raised by Calvin Johnson, and grew up with stories of her heritage as an Inhuman, and her potential to be more. Becoming the Project Centipede recruiter due to her interest in powered people, Raina works with Hydra in an attempt to replicate the GH-325 serum that was used to resurrect Coulson. She eventually goes through Terrigenesis, gaining the power of precognition, but also a monstrous appearance. Raina comes to accept her new circumstances, and later allows Jiaying to kill her so that Skye can learn of the former's true intent. It was later revealed that Raina had the gravitonium absorb Ian Quinn.\n\nNegga was first cast as a guest star in October 2013,<ref name=\"Negga\" /> with executive producer Jeffrey Bell later explaining that \"Ruth Negga showed up and we just fell in love with her and found ways to use her beyond our initial conception\".<ref name=\"NeggaMarvel\" /> Foley was informed of Raina ahead of time, allowing her to flesh out the character with illustrations, as well as print specific fabric. When Raina is introduced in \"Girl in the Flower Dress\", Foley and Negga \"wanted to show a progression in her dresses that reflects where her character might be going\", with her initially unclear intentions paired with \"a softer silhouette\" and a pattern of white with black flowers. For her second appearance in the episode, \"it's becoming clear that she has an agenda\" so the dress is more streamlined, and the colors are flipped to black with white flowers. For her final appearance in the episode, her dress is red with black flowers. Foley concluded, \"By the time you see her again in [\"The Bridge\"] you know she means business\".<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> After Raina is transformed in the second season she hides her hideous appearance with a hooded jacket, which Foley subtly added a flower pattern to, as \"she was always going to be the girl in the flower dress, so I wanted to pay tribute to that\".<ref name=\"FoleyJiayingRaina\" />\n\nRaina's Inhuman look was created by [[Glenn Hetrick]] of Optic Nerve Studios. To get to the final look, the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the [[Clive Barker]] film ''[[Nightbreed]]'', specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because \"She\u2019s a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong \u2014 it creates such a striking silhouette\". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to \"make her feel like the first real Inhuman\" and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, \"Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [the makeup].\"<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" />\n\n====Victoria Hand====\n{{further|Victoria Hand}}\nVictoria Hand (portrayed by [[Saffron Burrows]]) is introduced as the high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who runs The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base. After discovering that Hydra exists within S.H.I.E.L.D., Hand turns on Coulson, believing him to be a double agent. However, Garrett soon reveals himself to be the traitor, and Hand works with Coulson to detain him. She is killed by Ward when he reveals himself to be a member of Hydra to save Garrett from imprisonment. Her Framework counterpart was responsible for bringing Ward into the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\nIn November 2013, Burrows was announced as playing Hand,<ref name=\"Burrows\" /> who was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Mike Deodato]], and played an integral role in their ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' comic book series.<ref name=\"HandComics\" /> The character was intentionally introduced in the first season as a mislead for the true identity of the Clairvoyant.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> With the introduction of [[Lucy Lawless]] as Isabelle Hartley in the second season, the executive producers considered establishing a relationship between Hand and Hartley, since the comic book-counterpart of Hand was in a relationship with a character called Isabelle, but Tancharoen stated that \"it started to be irresponsible if we addressed it to not address it with more weight and time and energy.\"<ref name=\"HartleyHand\" /> However, this relationship was later hinted at onscreen in \"[[One Door Closes]]\".<ref name=\"HartleyHand2\" />\n\n====Davis====\nDavis (portrayed by [[Maximilian Osinski]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who worked alongside Phil Coulson's group on investigating the explosion at StatiCorp's Particle Accelerator Complex before the Hydra Uprising. He later returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. when Jeffrey Mace became its director.<ref name=\"S1Disc2\" /> During the LMD infiltration of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Davis and a few surviving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents help Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons escape the base. Davis helps protect Daisy and Simmons as they infiltrate the Framework to save their friends, after which he is attacked by Ophelia and badly wounded. Mike Peterson saves him and later reunites him with Coulson's fugitive team at the Lighthouse. Davis later assisted in the search for Fitz and Enoch. During Izel's raid of the Lighthouse, she possessed Davis' body and manipulated him into falling to his death in the control room.\n\n====Anne Weaver====\nAnne Weaver (portrayed by [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]])<ref name=\"Adams\" /> is the director of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology. Following the fall of the original organization in which she fought one of Hydra's enhanced soldiers until she was saved by Tomas Calderon, she joins the leadership of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" Anne takes over command of the S.H.I.E.L.D. warship ''The Iliad'' following the death of Robert Gonzales.\n\n====John Garrett / The Clairvoyant====\n{{further|John Garrett (comics)}}\nJohn Garrett (portrayed by [[Bill Paxton]]) was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was left for dead by that organization, and only survived by becoming the first Deathlok. Joining Hydra, he became \"The Clairvoyant\", leader of the Centipede group, and was focused on discovering the secret to Coulson's resurrection given the impending failure of his now outdated Deathlok technology. Under the guise of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tasked with capturing and interrogating Ian Quinn, Garrett joins in Coulson's efforts to find the GH-325 drug. Based on his findings, Raina is able to synthesize a version of the drug, which does save his life. However, after Hydra is revealed to have infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Garret is outed as the Clairvoyant, Coulson kills him by disintegration.\n\nIn December 2013, \"a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward\" was set to be added to the series.<ref name=\"NewRecurring\" /> The next month, Paxton was cast as Agent [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]], \"a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger\".<ref name=\"PaxtonTVGuide\" /> Garrett was first introduced by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] in ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]''.<ref name=\"GarrettComics\" /> Jed Whedon said that \"We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when we were talking about the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it.\"<ref name=\"PaxtonIGN\" /> Following the revelation that Garrett was The Clairvoyant, Paxton said, \"He\u2019s felt like he\u2019s found a true home in Hydra, which is more of a Darwinian outfit. It\u2019s survival of the fittest. He can relate to that.\"<ref name=\"PaxtonMarvel\" />\n\n====Antoine Triplett====\nAntoine Triplett (portrayed by [[B.J. Britt]]) worked with Garrett until the Hydra reveal, after which he joins Coulson's team. Trip perishes when he becomes trapped in the chamber Skye and Raina undergo Terrigenesis in and gets hit by a fragment of the Diviner. In the Framework, Antoine Triplett is Jeffrey Mace's inside man who got caught and was incarcerated at a Hydra Cultivation Enlightenment Camp until he was freed by Mace and Phil Coulson.\n\nIn December 2013, \"an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons\" was set to be added to the series.<ref name=\"NewRecurring\" /> In February, Britt was announced as cast in the role of Triplett.<ref name=\"Britt\" /> Britt's smile and charm were incorporated into the character after he had worked with the writers for several episodes, with Tancharoen saying to Britt \"I love your smile. We have to incorporate the smile of Trip into the show.\"<ref name=\"BrittDeath\" /> Britt said of the character, \"Trip likes to make sure everything is in order...he\u2019s going make sure that stuff doesn\u2019t go wrong. [But] I still feel like Trip has something to prove. That\u2019s going to cross over to the second season where Trip wants to show Coulson that he can trust him.\"<ref name=\"BrittRebuilding\" /> Britt returned in the fourth season to reprise the character within the Framework reality.<ref name=\"BrittS4\" />\n\n====Glenn Talbot / Graviton====\n{{further|Glenn Talbot|Graviton (comics)}}\nGlenn Talbot (portrayed by [[Adrian Pasdar]]) is a [[United States Air Force]] [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and later [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] who hunts active S.H.I.E.L.D. agents after the organization's disbandment. Coulson earns his trust over time, and the two soon enter an agreement in which S.H.I.E.L.D. provides the government with sensitive assets and helps with the take down of Hydra in exchange for being left alone. He is made head of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit (ATCU) following the death of Rosalind Price, an arrangement which sees him reluctantly working for Coulson. Glenn Talbot is later placed in a coma following a head shot caused by the Daisy Johnson LMD at a government meeting. Talbot was later revealed to be a prisoner of General Hale until Coulson managed to free him. However, upon calling his wife Carla, Hale's subordinate Candice Lee forces her to read a script to activate his brainwashing that occurred during his imprisonment. Talbot eventually enters the Rebirth machine to absorb gravitonium, becoming Graviton. He finds Robin Hinton so she can tell him where the gravitonium within the Earth is located. During his fight with Johnson, Talbot is blasted into space after Johnson takes the Centipede Serum where his body becomes frozen in ice.\n\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] for ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #61, Talbot was a recurring antagonist of the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"TalbotComics\" /> Pasdar was cast as Talbot by March 2014, with this version focused on taking down Hydra.<ref name=\"Pasdar\" /> In the fifth season, Talbot becomes the villain Graviton, despite the series previously introducing Franklin Hall in the first season, the character who becomes the villain in the comics.<ref name=\"Graviton\" /><ref name=\"Graviton2\" />\n\n====The Koenigs====\n{{further|Eric Koenig}}\nEric, Billy, Sam, and Thurston Koenig (all portrayed by [[Patton Oswalt]]) are identical brothers. The former three are S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, programmers in the initial S.H.I.E.L.D. LMD program. Eric is stationed at the Providence base and assists Coulson in the wake of Hydra's emergence, but is soon killed by Ward. Coulson and his team meet Billy, the brother of Eric, at the Playground base soon after. Billy and Sam work with Coulson on the mysterious Theta Protocol, the maintenance of a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[helicarrier]] for use by [[Nick Fury]]. Later, Coulson entrusts the Darkhold to Billy and Sam, who hide the book in the Labyrinth, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base only accessible by the Koenigs. Thurston is a slam poet activist who is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and refers to them as a bunch of \"sheep\" due to the death of their brother Eric\n\nOswalt joined the series as Eric Koenig in March 2014.<ref name=\"Oswalt\" /> This version of the character is loosely inspired by one that first appeared in ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #27.<ref name=\"Oswalt\" /> Oswalt also portrays Eric's brothers.<ref name=\"BloodTVGuide\" /> After previously working on Joss Whedon's ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' and being a long time fan of Marvel, Oswalt was sought for the part specifically.<ref name=\"Oswalt\" />\n\n====Calvin Johnson====\n{{further|Mister Hyde (comics)}}\nCalvin Johnson (portrayed by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), a young doctor, met the Inhuman Jiaying while in China. The two eventually married, and had a daughter, Daisy. After Jiaying was torn apart by Hydra, and Daisy was taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Cal stitched his wife back together, found innocent people whose life-force was used to bring Jiaying back to life, and began searching for his daughter, at some point changing his last name. He also began experimenting on himself in an attempt to be stronger, blaming himself for not protecting his family. Jiaying eventually abandoned the search to live a peaceful life with other Inhumans like her, but Cal continued, eventually meeting Daisy\u2014now going by Skye\u2014and over time forming a bond with her, despite her hatred for his past actions. Coulson later convinces Cal that Jiaying is a monster who has forced him to do terrible things, and when Jiaying starts a war with S.H.I.E.L.D. that leads to a face down with Skye, Cal kills Jiaying. S.H.I.E.L.D. then wipes Cal's memory to allow him to live a peaceful life.\n\nDuring the first-season finale, Skye's father is briefly seen from behind, portrayed by a [[stand-in]]. In August 2014, MacLachlan was cast in the role,<ref name=\"MacLachlan/Pasdar\" /> to recur throughout the second season.<ref name=\"MacLachlan\" /> Initially referred to as \"The Doctor\",<ref name=\"MacLachlan/Pasdar\" /> his character was revealed to be Calvin Zabo, also known as Mister Hyde, in December 2014.<ref name=\"DaisyCal\" /> Zabo was created by Stan Lee and [[Don Heck]] for ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' in 1963, and is influenced by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.<ref name=\"HydeComics\" /> MacLachlan's makeup for his transformation into the Mister Hyde persona in the second-season finale took around two and a half hours to apply.<ref name=\"MacLachlanMakeup\" /> Following the conclusion of season two, Bell said on Cal's storyline, \"He got to live a happily ever after in a beautiful way. We would never write off the idea of finding more story for him down the road, but we had a great time with Kyle this year and feel like that was a story that ended nicely.\"<ref name=\"BellEWS2Finale\" /> Bell elaborated that they \"felt like everything he did came from the right place but that he was just a really horrible, broken man. The idea of [using] the T.A.H.I.T.I. program to reset him as the good person that has always been in there was too good to pass up.\"<ref name=\"BellIGNS2Finale\" />\n\n===Introduced in season two===\n====Daniel Whitehall====\n{{further|Kraken (Marvel Comics)}}\nWerner Reinhardt (portrayed by [[Reed Diamond]]), a high ranking Nazi officer and an elite member of Hydra in 1945, was experimenting on the Diviner when his base was taken by the SSR and he was imprisoned for life. Released by [[Alexander Goodwin Pierce|Alexander Pierce]] in 1988, Reinhardt discovered that a woman unaffected by the Diviner, Jiaying, had apparently not aged in four decades. Dissecting her, Reinhardt discovered the secret to her youthfulness and used it to de-age himself. Taking the name Daniel Whitehall, he became the North American leader of Hydra following Pierce's death, fighting against Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. while remaining interested in the Diviner and other alien matters. He is killed by Coulson while trying to unlock the true power of the Diviner. It was revealed that he trained General Hale and had her partake in raising Hydra's next leader through insemination.\n\nAt the San Diego Comic Con in July 2014, Diamond was announced as portraying [[Kraken (Marvel Comics)|Daniel Whitehall]],<ref name=\"BloodTVGuide\" /> also known as the Kraken in the comics,<ref name=\"DiamondMarvel\" /> where he was introduced by [[Jonathan Hickman]] for ''[[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]]'' #7.<ref name=\"KrakenComics\" /> Diamond previously worked with the creators on ''Dollhouse'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing (2012 film)|Much Ado About Nothing]]'', and though they had wanted him for parts throughout the first season, he had been unavailable due to commitments to another series. Diamond accepted the role of Whitehall with just 24 hours to prepare, during which he formed the character's German accent to use for flashback sequences. In developing the character, Diamond watched [[Nazi]] documentaries, and re-watched Marvel's films, looking at the characters of Loki and [[Red Skull]] in particular. From the former, Diamond was inspired by his ''The Avengers'' quote, \"I am burdened with glorious purpose\", as he had never played a super villain, \"someone who really believed that they were the best person to rule the universe, or at least the Earth.\" For [[Hugo Weaving]]'s portrayal of the Red Skull, Diamond looked at his anger and voice to see \"how [Whitehall] would fit in within that spectrum\", and settled on \"this is TV. I\u2019m the smiling, calm, villain.\" Diamond also sought advice from [[Malcolm McDowell]], who told him to \"Always smile and let the lines do the work.\" The character is often seen cleaning his glasses, an \"identifying quality\" devised by Jed Whedon.<ref name=\"DiamondMarvel\" />\n\n====Sunil Bakshi====\nSunil Bakshi (portrayed by [[Simon Kassianides]]), the right-hand man to Whitehall, is instrumental in the brainwashing of Hydra's subjects, including S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Kara Palamas, who later gets revenge by brainwashing Bakshi herself. Now loyal to Palamas and Ward, Bakshi sacrifices his life to save the latter when Simmons tries to kill him. In the Framework, Sunil Bakshi is a [[news presenter]] who hosts ''The Bakshi Report'' where he reports on Hydra's actions against the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\nKassianides, a fan of the series and of comic books in general,<ref name=\"KassianidesRelishes\" /> was cast in the \"major recurring role\" of Bakshi in July 2014.<ref name=\"Kassianides\" /> The producers intended for Bakshi to be killed off in the fifth episode of the second season, but changed their minds after Kassianides' early table reads and extended his run on the show through to the nineteenth episode.<ref name=\"ThisWeek22\" /> Speaking of the character's relationship with Whitehall, Kassianides explained, \"Bakshi really feels he can act under the authority of Whitehall on his own, using his own judgment. He has the trust of Whitehall and is acting as he sees fit, the consequences of which will play out.\" On Bakshi's motivations and thought process, Kassianides said \"When you\u2019re that committed to any ideology, I think that it allows for elements of insanity ... whether that\u2019s been trained in him or it\u2019s inherent, it\u2019s not clear, but he\u2019s certainly at that point where hurting people, torturing people, and operating under this ideology is something he quite enjoys.\"<ref name=\"KassianidesRelishes\" />\n\n====Carl Creel====\n{{further|Absorbing Man}}\nCarl Creel (portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]]) is a Hydra operative recruited by Garrett and brainwashed by Whitehall who can absorb the properties of whatever he touches.<ref name=\"Wade\" /> He is later hired by Talbot to serve as his bodyguard, but quits when Talbot is injured and hospitalized. Sometime later, Creel is hired by General Hale to help her hunt S.H.I.E.L.D., but he betrays her after learning she is holding Talbot prisoner, helping Coulson and Talbot escape. Creel also forms a mental link with gravitonium and discovers that the minds of Franklin Hall and Ian Quinn live on inside it after it absorbed them. While recuperating in the hospital, Creel is visited by Glenn Talbot who absorbs Creel into himself with his gravitonium.\n\nWade was cast in the role in August 2014.<ref name=\"Wade\" />\n\n====Kara Palamas / Agent 33====\nKara Palamas (portrayed by [[Maya Stojan]]) was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent betrayed to Hydra by the then undercover Morse and subjected to brainwashing by Bakshi and Whitehall. The now Hydra-loyal Palamas used a nanomask to take on the appearance of May, and when the latter electrocutes Palamas whilst in this disguise, she is left stuck as May, but deformed. After Coulson kills Whitehall, Palamas works with Ward, the two forming a romantic relationship while the latter does everything in his power to bring Palamas \"closure\". They get her nanomask repaired so that she can become whoever she wishes, brainwash Bakshi, and kidnap Morse in an attempt to force a confession out of her. When May and Hunter come to rescue Morse, Ward accidentally kills Palamas while she is in disguise as May.\n\nWhile Stojan portrays Palamas,<ref name=\"Stojan\" /><ref name=\"Agent33Name\" /> the character is also portrayed by other cast members, including Ming-Na Wen and Chloe Bennet, when she takes on the appearance of their characters.<ref name=\"WenBennetAgent33\" /> Stojan had to balance working on the series with her concurrent recurring role on ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', but was still able to appear in every episode offered to her.<ref name=\"StojanQ&A\" /> Speaking about portraying Palamas, and the differences between her and May, Wen said, \"not only did she lose her face, she lost her will, really. I mean she is completely controlled by Whitehall and...it\u2019s sort of a sad character for me to portray because she\u2019s so opposite from May. May is so confident and knows exactly what she needs to do and can get the job done based on her own opinions and with Agent 33, not only is she disfigured, not only doesn\u2019t she have her face anymore, she doesn\u2019t have her identity anymore.\"<ref name=\"Wen33\" /> After Palamas breaks free of her brainwashing and joins Ward, Stojan said of the character and their new relationship, \"That love/romance that she has with Ward...she's really, I think, trying to find herself\u2014whether it's good or bad. She truly believes in that one man, and she's going to follow him.\n\n====Jiaying Johnson====\nJiaying Johnson (portrayed by [[Dichen Lachman]])<ref name=\"Lachman\" /><ref name=\"Jiaying\" /> is the Inhuman wife of Calvin Johnson, and Daisy's mother, who does not age and can heal rapidly thanks to an elder of her village giving their life each year. Pieced back together by Calvin after Whitehall dissects her to discover the secret to her abilities, Jiaying is never the same, and goes to great lengths to find her daughter, now willingly taking innocent lives to feed her abilities, having no regard for humans. Eventually Jiaying tries to escape this new persona by founding Afterlife, a haven for Inhumans, and when Daisy (going by Skye) journeys to Afterlife, Jiaying happily becomes her mentor. However, when S.H.I.E.L.D. discovers the location of Afterlife, Jiaying starts a war with them, and attempts to kill all humans with artificial Terrigen crystals. She even tries to drain Skye's life when the former turns on her, but is stopped by Calvin, who kills her. After Tony Caine gives Daisy the information about the modified Project Centipede serum that John Garrett used, she goes to the graveyard and starts exhuming Jaiying's grave.\n\nSpeaking about the levels of violence depicted in the series, Bell admitted that the executive producers and the network did question the graphicness of the sequence where Jiaying is dissected by Whitehall, but that it was ultimately kept as is because they felt that \"it was important for you to understand how horrible that was and what she went through and miraculously survived\u2014that was a big part of our story.\"<ref name=\"BellJiaying\" /> For Jiaying's costume, Foley \"wanted her to have an other-worldly kind of feeling and then also, at the time, Dichen [Lachman] was pregnant, so we needed to come up with a silhouette that could hide the pregnancy, and kind of grow with her which is why we landed on that tunic. The great thing about it is that it had this really cool Asian feeling to it with the high neck and the buttons down the front.\"<ref name=\"FoleyJiayingRaina\" /> Foley chose the fabrics for Jiaying's tunics based on what was going on in the story and how she felt the character was thinking.<ref name=\"FoleyJiayingRaina\" />\n\nIn regards to Jiaying's perceived role as the main villain of the second season due to her actions in the final episodes, Bell said \"In our minds, [Jiaying] wasn\u2019t a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyS2Finale\" /> After the character's backstory and motivations were revealed, she was compared by some to the Marvel Comics character [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. In response to this, Bell said \"We didn\u2019t consciously mimic [Magneto], but what they both have in common is a valid motive. Jiaying was ripped to shreds...I feel like her motive is really earned in the same way that Magneto\u2019s is fairly earned. We always want our antagonists to have good motives...We tried to make everything she says be true.\"<ref name=\"BellJiaying\" />\n\n====Gordon====\n{{For|the subsequent comic book version|Gordon (comics)}}\nGordon (portrayed by [[Jamie Harris (actor)|Jamie Harris]])<ref name=\"211Synopsis\" /> is an eyeless Inhuman with the ability to teleport and emit force fields. His transition to an Inhuman was tended to by Jiaying, and he remained loyal to her in his adult life, ensuring that only a select few could enter and leave Afterlife, and joining with her in her war against S.H.I.E.L.D. While trying to spread Terrigen Mist through the ventilation system of ''The Iliad'', he is killed by Fitz.\n\n====Andrew Garner / Lash====\n{{redirect|Andrew Garner|the football player|Andy Garner}}\n{{further|Lash (comics)}}\nAndrew Garner (portrayed by [[Blair Underwood]]) is May's ex-husband and a psychologist at Culver University who assesses gifted people for S.H.I.E.L.D. Following a vacation with May to try and rekindle their relationship, Garner is exposed to Terrigen which unlocks Inhuman abilities within him; he becomes the monstrous Lash (portrayed by [[Matt Willig]]), who uses energy abilities to hunt and kill 'unworthy' Inhumans. Garner surrenders himself to S.H.I.E.L.D. before the transformation becomes permanent, and manages to say goodbye to May before completely becoming Lash. S.H.I.E.L.D. then send Lash to fight Hive, hoping that his Inhuman purpose is to destroy the latter. Though this is not the case, Lash is able to purge Daisy Johnson of Hive's control, before being killed by Hellfire.\n\nIn December 2014, Underwood was revealed to be cast as Garner for multiple appearances starting in the second season.<ref name=\"Underwood\" /> In July 2015, the Inhuman Lash, who was created by [[Charles Soule]] and [[Joe Madureira]] for ''Inhuman'' #1, was announced as appearing in the third season.<ref name=\"SDCC2015\" /><ref name=\"WilligRaba\" /> That August, Willig was revealed to be cast as Lash,<ref name=\"WilligRaba\" /> with Hetrick again working alongside the series' makeup and visual effects teams to realize the character's \"unique look\" from the comics.<ref name=\"HetrickLash\" /> Whedon noted that it would be their \"own take on [Lash]. There will be some elements from the comics for sure, but as we always do...we\u2019re changing it up a little bit.\"<ref name=\"WhedonTancharoenEW\" /> Bell elaborated that \"it\u2019s hard to have a hidden or magical city\" in the MCU, such as Lash's comic home of Orollan, but \"Lash\u2019s agenda can certainly remain true to what it was in the comics\", with him judging whether Inhumans are worthy.<ref name=\"BellCBOct2015\" /> Willig's Lash make-up initially took six hours to apply, but the make-up team was able to reduce the time to four and a half hours.<ref name=\"LashMakeUp\" />\n\nWhedon noted that the series already has several Inhumans who are \"fairly attractive\" and the producers wanted \"to also show the other side of the change that bad things can happen\", with Tancharoen elaborating that \"on a very basic level, we were interested in putting a monster in the mix, because he is not human and his looks are pretty crazy and scary. We wanted to put our team up against something like that.\"<ref name=\"WhedonTancharoenEW\" /> On how the cast and characters react to seeing Lash, Bennet said, \"I like to think that they've seen their fair share of crazy shit and that's just something that's pretty insane but not totally mind-blowing.\"<ref name=\"BennetCBSep2015\" /> Following the reveal that Lash still had a human form, Bell said that they would spend time exploring different characters as potential candidates,<ref name=\"BellCBOct2015\" /> though the human form was revealed to be Garner two episodes later.<ref name=\"GarnerLash\" /> For the onscreen CGI transformation from Garner to Lash, Underwood and Willig were 3D scanned (the latter while in full prosthetics and make-up), and then Underwood provided motion capture for the sequence, as visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack noted the lack of resemblance between Underwood and the final Lash design, and so wanted to keep as much of Underwood's \"essence\" throughout the transformation process as possible. Underwood portrayed the transformation as \"painful\", \"rigid\", and \"tiring\", though he noted that it would become easier for the character to transform the more it happened.<ref name=\"LashTransformation\" />\n\nGoing into the third season, Underwood had only known that the producers wanted to explore more of Garner's personal life, after his appearances in the second season were \"as an appendage to Agent May...a device and a construct to open her up and see more of her life.\" He also did not see the Lash reveal coming, which he did not learn until the table read for \"[[Devils You Know]]\", when it is presumed Garner is dead, and the producers approached him afterwards to tell them their plan for the character. Underwood compared the Garner / Lash dynamic to [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Jekyll and Hyde]] and Bruce Banner / the Hulk, and compared the new May / Garner dynamic to ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref name=\"UnderwoodCBRNov2015\" /> On Lash's motivations, Underwood stated that \"Lash sees [the Inhumans] as an exalted society and it's an honor to be an Inhuman. Not everyone is worthy of that moniker. He takes it upon himself to be judge, jury and executioner of who is worthy of being an Inhuman and who is not.\"<ref name=\"UnderwoodCBRNov2015\" /> Elaborating on this and Garner's connection to Lash, Underwood said, \"If you look at his work as a psychologist...in S.H.I.E.L.D., he determines [who] is worthy and is not worthy to be part of the Secret Warriors team...it makes sense that it's kind of that same kind of rationale, but on steroids\".<ref name=\"UnderwoodENov2015\" />\n\n====Robert Gonzales====\nRobert Gonzales (portrayed by [[Edward James Olmos]]) is an elderly S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, tactician, and the commander of ''The Iliad'' during the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. who is tasked with protecting the Kree monolith. He is convinced not to destroy the ship (to prevent Hydra from claiming the monolith) so that the hundreds of agents on board may live, disobeying Fury's orders, and subsequently becomes a founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" alongside Anne Weaver, Tomas Calderon, and Agent Oliver. He remains hypocritical of secrets and all things alien, even after agreeing to keep Coulson on as Director of a new, unified S.H.I.E.L.D., but still attempts to negotiate with Jiaying and the Inhumans peacefully. However, Jiaying kills Gonzales and shoots herself, claiming that he attacked her, in order to start a war against S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Olmos would be joining the series as Robert Gonzales,<ref name=\"Olmos\" /> with Olmos describing joining the MCU one of the high points of his career.<ref name=\"OlmosE\" /> Concerning the apparent difference in philosophies between Gonzales and Coulson, Olmos explained that \"the situations that I\u2019ve come across and the situations that he\u2019s come across have changed our ability to work with the same understanding. He\u2019s working like Fury worked and under that understanding. I don\u2019t work under Fury\u2019s understanding....I think that Coulson\u2019s philosophy is the same as mine! We are S.H.I.E.L.D. We are not anything but S.H.I.E.L.D. people. It\u2019s just that our S.H.I.E.L.D., the one that we originally put forth, was very, very transparent. And the S.H.I.E.L.D. that has materialized under Fury\u2014and now Coulson\u2014is much more secretive.\" Olmos also compared the relationship between the two factions of S.H.I.E.L.D. to that between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref name=\"OlmosMarvel\" />\n\n====Alisha Whitley====\nAlisha Whitley (portrayed by Alicia Vela-Bailey)<ref name=\"SOS\" /> is a duplicating Inhuman who was loyal to Jiaying until she learned that the latter started the war with S.H.I.E.L.D. After Jiaying's death, Alisha helps S.H.I.E.L.D. until she falls under the influence of Hive. She is later murdered by a Kree reaper offscreen.\n\n====Kebo====\nKebo (portrayed by Daz Crawford) is a member of Hydra, second-in-command to Ward until he is killed by Morse. Crawford only signed on for the second-season finale,<ref name=\"SOS\" /><ref name=\"CrawfordCV\" /> but the writers liked him in the character and so brought him back for the third season.<ref name=\"CrawfordCV\" /> Crawford said that Kebo has reservations about Ward as a boss, but \"some people like their bosses, some people don\u2019t.\"<ref name=\"CrawfordCV\" />\n\n===Introduced in season three===\n====Rosalind Price====\nRosalind Price (portrayed by [[Constance Zimmer]]) is the head of the ATCU as it crosses paths with S.H.I.E.L.D. in the hunt for Inhumans. After developing a romantic relationship with Coulson, Price is killed by Ward.\n\nIn July 2015, Zimmer was cast as Price,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /><ref name=\"Ep301\" /> who Gregg described as \"a potent...I wouldn\u2019t say doppelganger, but she\u2019s definitely got a lot in common with Coulson. She represents a character who\u2019s not someone he comes across every day, who has more in common with him than most other people do.\"<ref name=\"TCAParty2015\" /> That September, Bell elaborated, \"Where in the past, Coulson frequently plays sort of a paternal role on the show, because Daisy is kind of a surrogate daughter figure\u2014suddenly there's another adult [in Price], who can banter, who can hold her own, and there's something nice about seeing him in that relationship.\"<ref name=\"BellSep2015\" />\n\n====Luther Banks====\nLuther Banks (portrayed by [[Andrew Howard]])<ref name=\"Howard\" /> is an ATCU agent and former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] loyal to Price. He is killed by Giyera.\n\n====Joey Gutierrez====\nJoey Gutierrez (portrayed by [[Juan Pablo Raba]]) is an Inhuman and former construction worker with the ability to melt certain metals who is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. for Daisy Johnson's Secret Warriors team.\n\nRaba was announced as cast in August 2015.<ref name=\"WilligRaba\" /> Scott Meslow of [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] and Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', reviewing the season three episode \"Laws of Nature\", both indicated their pleasure in seeing Gutierrez, a gay character, appear on the series, which Meslow noted appeared to be the first openly gay character in the MCU.<ref name=\"VultureLoNReview\" /><ref name=\"AVClubLoNReview\" />\n\n====Werner von Strucker====\n{{further|Werner von Strucker}}\nWerner von Strucker (portrayed by [[Spencer Treat Clark]])<ref name=\"302IGN\" /> is the son of Hydra leader Baron \u201cWolfgang\u201d von Strucker, who is recruited to Hydra by Ward after Wolfgang's death. After failing to follow Ward's orders to kill Garner, Werner is left in a vegetative state by Kebo, and is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. He is later hospitalized in an asylum and teams up with General Hale and her daughter Ruby upon being freed. Werner gave in to General Hale's demands when he saw one of his father's experiments in the form of Carl Creel lifting weights. After Ruby gets 8% of the gravitonium in her, Werner is accidentally killed by Ruby.\n\n====Giyera====\nR. Giyera (portrayed by [[Mark Dacascos]])<ref name=\"Dacascos\" /> is a telekinetic Inhuman and head of security for the ATCU, secretly loyal to Malick. He is eventually swayed over to Hive's side, until he is killed by Fitz.\n\n====Polly Hinton====\nPolly Hinton (portrayed by [[Lola Glaudini]])<ref name=\"315Synopsis\" /> is the wife of Charles Hinton and mother of Robin Hinton.\n\n====J.T. James / Hellfire====\n{{further|Hellfire (J.T. Slade)}}\nJ.T. James (portrayed by [[Axle Whitehead]]) is an Inhuman who was refused the right of Terrigenesis by Jiaying and banished from Afterlife. Johnson subjects James to the transformation while under the influence of Hive, giving James the ability to imbue objects with fire. He is then taken under Hive's influence himself, and chooses the codename Hellfire. After Hive is destroyed, James suffers terrible withdrawal symptoms and comes to hate being an Inhuman as a result. He betrays his kind to the Watchdogs, helping them track and kill other Inhumans, with the promise that they would kill him when they are done.\n\nWhitehead first guest starred as James in \"Paradise Lost\", introduced as someone from Lincoln's past, with Whitehead and Mitchell having previously starred together on ''[[Home and Away]]''.<ref name=\"WhiteheadHaA\" /> With the character recurring through the rest of the third season, he was revealed to be an adaptation of the comic Secret Warrior character Hellfire.<ref name=\"Hellfire\" /> Executive producer Tancharoen felt it was \"a no-brainer\" to include Hellfire in the series, despite him not being Inhuman in the comics. Whedon expanded, saying, \"We liked his attitude. He\u2019s a tell-it-like-it-is guy. He\u2019s a little bit of a prick. He does not care if he\u2019s liked, and that\u2019s fun to write.\" The producers were also able to find a way to incorporate Hellfire's signature fire chain into the series.<ref name=\"HellfireEW\" /> In the fourth season, it is revealed that his full name is J.T. James.<ref name=\"JamesName\" />\n\n====Anderson====\nAnderson (portrayed by Alexander Wraith)<ref name=\"316Synopsis\" /> is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and assistant to Coulson.\n\n====Piper====\nPiper (portrayed by [[Briana Venskus]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and member of May's strike team.<ref name=\"Piper\" />\n\nIn season six, she helps to look for Fitz and even helps to deal with Izel. Piper helps to evacuate Flint from the temple.\n\n====Aida \"Ophelia\" / Madame Hydra====\n{{further|AIDA (comics)|Viper (Madame Hydra)}}\nAida (portrayed by [[Mallory Jansen]]) is a Life Model Decoy, an android body based on Radcliffe's former lover and partner Agnes Kitsworth (also portrayed by Jansen) into which he transferred his artificial intelligence AIDA (voiced by Amanda Rea). After the ''Darkhold'' shows Radcliffe the secret to eternal life, Radcliffe programs Aida to go rogue in an attempt to steal the book from S.H.I.E.L.D. She is ultimately beheaded in battle against S.H.I.E.L.D., and Radcliffe builds a new model of the android. Aida later kills Kitsworth, so her consciousness can reside in the Framework reality. Aida enters the Framework where she takes up the name \"Ophelia\" and is also known as Madame Hydra, the leader of Hydra. She also has a relationship with Leo Fitz in his alias of The Doctor. Agnes also resides in the Framework, living with Radcliffe's consciousness on Ogygia before she is deleted by The Doctor. With the help of Project Looking Glass, Aida succeeds in making her organic body, and once again goes by Ophelia. Ophelia also gains the Inhuman abilities of teleportation, electric charge manipulation, and a healing factor. She is later killed by Phil Coulson possessed by Ghost Rider.\n\nThe artificial intelligence AIDA is briefly voiced by Amanda Rea in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"321-322Synopsis\" /> By June 2016, casting was underway for a \"very attractive\" actress to portray the robot in a recurring role for the fourth season. The character was described as moving around \"quite naturally\", but speaking \"a bit formally\" like [[Iron Man]]'s [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] A.I. in the MCU films.<ref name=\"AIDAS4\" /> In August, Jansen was cast in the role;<ref name=\"Jansen\" /> she also portrays Agnes Kitsworth,<ref name=\"413Synopsis\" /> for which she uses her native Australian accent.<ref name=\"413Nerdist\" /> In April 2017, it was revealed that Aida would appear in the Framework reality as Madame Hydra, also portrayed by Jansen.<ref name=\"MadameHydra\" /><ref name=\"Ophelia\" /> On having Aida become Madame Hydra, Whedon noted, \"We had what is one of most formidable female villains we\u2019ve ever had [in Aida], and we were bringing back Hydra, so it seemed like a natural pairing. She\u2019s plugged herself into this world and clearly she\u2019s trying to live some other new, unique life. We felt like if you grew up in a world and tried to be as powerful as you could be, and that world was Hydra-dominated, then it would be natural that she would become [Madame Hydra]. We thought it would be a fun way to introduce that character that\u2019s so creepy, odd, weird, and fun.\"<ref name=\"EW416EPs\" />\n\nAida's costume was custom made, and inspired by the works of [[Alexander McQueen]]. Foley wanted it to be simple to \"not take away from the character at all\", but also \"sort of a 'Where did this outfit come from?' kind of a feeling so that it's specifically hers. It just adds to the mystery of who she is.\"<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Jansen described \"Aida 2.0\" as being programmed to be more ruthless, with the character's costume a darker shade of gray than that worn by the original Aida to reflect these changes.<ref name=\"ThisWeek53\" /> New costume designer Amanda Riley took Foley's costumes for Aida as the base shape of the Madame Hydra costume, but looked to make it feel \"stronger\" and more military-esque than those costumes by having the shoulders of the costume evoke [[epaulette]]s. The costume uses the color green, which is closely tied with the character in the comics.<ref name=\"ThisWeek58\" />\n\n===Introduced in season four===\n====Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider====\n{{further|Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)}}\nRoberto \"Robbie\" Reyes (portrayed by [[Gabriel Luna]]) is a mechanic who, alongside his brother Gabe, was attacked by gang members who were hired to kill their uncle [[Eli Morrow]]. Gabe was paralyzed and Robbie was killed, but his life was saved when a Ghost Rider riding a motorcycle gave Robbie his power, creating a new Ghost Rider. Robbie lives to protect Gabe, and at night he seeks out vengeance by hunting the guilty and murdering them. His actions bring him into contact with the vigilante Quake and the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., through whom he learns of his uncle's interests in the ''Darkhold''. This leads to Robbie taking Morrow through a portal to another dimension. After returning to Earth, Robbie Reyes helps to defeat Aida and uses his new portal-making abilities to take the Darkhold far away.\n\nAdvertisements for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' ahead of the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] featuring a flaming chain lead to speculation that the character of Ghost Rider would be joining the series during the season, though it was noted that the image could indicate an increased role for Hellfire after his introduction in the third season.<ref name=\"SDCC2016Trolly\" /> When casting for a Latino character matching the description of [[Marvel Comics]]' Robbie Reyes, was revealed to be underway for the series, further speculation pointed to the inclusion of Ghost Rider, a mantle that Reyes took over in the comics.<ref name=\"AIDAS4\" /><ref name=\"GhostRiderReyes\" /> At the series' Comic-Con panel, this speculation was confirmed, and Luna was announced to be cast in the role.<ref name=\"Luna\" /> Luna had initially been hesitant to sign up for a recurring, rather than starring, role, but changed his mind once he was told that the character would be Ghost Rider, who he was a fan of growing up.<ref name=\"ThisWeek45\" /> He felt it was \"too good to be true\" that Reyes \"was a character who looked like me, acted like me, and had this amazing family dynamic with his brother\",<ref name=\"NewsaramaNYCC2016\" /> with Luna relating to the latter since his father died before he was born leaving Luna the \"oldest male in [his] immediate family\".<ref name=\"ThisWeek45\" />\n\nLuna described the Ghost Rider as a \"separate entity\" from Reyes, comparing the dynamic to the Hulk.<ref name=\"ThisWeek45\" /> Reyes was chosen as the Ghost Rider for the series, over other versions of the character, since his is the newest version from the comics, and the executive producers thought \"it would be interesting to bring in someone with [his] background into our dynamic\". Regarding if the character would be possessed by a Satanic serial killer, as in the comics, or by the more traditional Spirit of Vengeance, Tancharoen said, \"We\u2019re staying true to his circumstance. But as always with any property that we use, we\u2019re taking our liberties with it,\" with Whedon adding that they would be \"pulling a little bit from different versions of the Ghost Rider\" with \"a little mixing and matching\".<ref name=\"GhostRiderEW\" /> Luna said that due to the character's recent introduction in the comics, \"a lot of the show is going to be expanding the Ghost Rider canon\";<ref name=\"LunaTHR\" /> however Luna read all 12 issues of the ''All-New Ghost Rider'' series that introduced Reyes for preparation.<ref name=\"LunaCBR\" /> The character drives a [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1969|1969 Dodge Charger]] in the show,<ref name=\"DodgeCharger\" /> the \"Hellcharger\" of the comics which Luna nicknamed Lucy, for [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"LunaLucy\" /> The production had a hero car and a double for stunts, while the visual effects team used a CG double when needed.<ref name=\"KolpackCharger\" /> [[Eric Norris]] serves as Luna's stunt driver,<ref name=\"NewsaramaNYCC2016\" /><ref name=\"KolpackNorris\" /> with Morgan Benoit, a frequent collaborator with Luna, as his stunt double.<ref name=\"NewsaramaNYCC2016\" />\n\nThe character's signature jacket and flaming head were designed by Marvel Television creative director Joshua Shaw, based on Felipe Smith's design from the comics.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /><ref name=\"KolpackGRDesign\" /> The skull design includes exhaust-type jets of flames coming from the temples to mimic the effects on his car.<ref name=\"CreatingGR\" /> For the CG skull, Luna wore tracking markers on his face to provide performance-reference for these sequences,<ref name=\"LunaTHR\" /> especially for the animation of Ghost Rider's coal-like eyes.<ref name=\"CreatingGR\" /> Luna also wears a hood fitted with flickering lights, to create the effect of fire lighting up his costume and surfaces around him. The lights can be adjusted to match different temperature fire for different situations.<ref name=\"LunaCBR\" /><ref name=\"CreatingGR\" /> Whedon noted that the series depicts Reyes' flaming head \"exactly as much as we can afford\", adding, \"We\u2019re hoping that the character has not just a flaming skull but some real heart to him, and some depth.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderFirstLook\" /> Foley paired the character's jacket with jeans and [[Vans]] to keep Reyes \"grounded in the reality of where he was brought up in Los Angeles\". Foley also worked with Kolpack to ensure that the costume would not interfere with the visual effects.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Since a skeleton does not have a voice box, the Ghost Rider does not speak in the series.<ref name=\"KolpackGRSpeak\" />\n\nIn August 2016, [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] said that the character \"could venture into other sections of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", depending on the audience's response to their take on him, saying, \"if we can tell that story in a compelling way, then the thing to do is to then have people want more. And if they want more, the networks say, oh, we want more.\" On this, Luna noted that he \"signed on the line to do all the work necessary ... that's extremely exciting.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderAug2016\" /> That October, Luna said that there had been \"rumblings\" about a spin-off for the character, but reiterated that it would depend on audience response.<ref name=\"GhostRiderOct2016\" />\n\n====Gabe Reyes====\n{{further|Gabe Reyes}}\nGabriel \"Gabe\" Reyes (portrayed by [[Lorenzo James Henrie]]) is Robbie's younger brother, who was paralyzed in the accident that led to Robbie becoming the Ghost Rider.\n\nCasting for a Latino character matching the description of Gabe Reyes, was revealed to be underway for the series at the same time as it was for Robbie.<ref name=\"AIDAS4\" /><ref name=\"GhostRiderReyes\" /> Robbie Reyes was confirmed for the series in September 2016,<ref name=\"Luna\" /> and Henrie was revealed to be portraying Gabe later that month.<ref name=\"401Synopsis\" /> The role was one of the first that Henrie auditioned for after he finished filming for ''[[Fear the Walking Dead]]'', in which his character is killed off. At his audition, Henrie confirmed that he would be able to dedicate his time to ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' without spoiling the events of ''Fear'' for the ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' casting team, and was cast in the role the next day. His introduction as Gabe aired only weeks after his ''Fear the Walking Dead'' death aired.<ref name=\"HenrieAudition\" />\n\n====Lucy Bauer====\nLucy Bauer (portrayed by Lilli Birdsell)<ref name=\"Birdsell\" /><ref name=\"405Synopsis\" /> was a scientist working at Momentum Labs in a group including her husband Joseph and engineer Eli Morrow. They were experimenting with the mysterious [[Darkhold]] until Morrow took steps to gain the book's power for himself by creating a machine that turned Lucy and her co-workers into [[ghost]]-like beings. Lucy later attempts to force Morrow to restore her body, but his nephew Robbie Reyes exorcised her first with the power of the Ghost Rider, destroying her.\n\n====Jeffrey Mace / Patriot====\n{{further|Jeffrey Mace}}\nJeffrey Mace (portrayed by [[Jason O'Mara]]) is the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who was appointed to try and restore the trust of the public following the public outlawing of Steve Rogers and several of the Avengers due to the Sokovia Accords. Originally thought by the public and other members of S.H.I.E.L.D. to be an Inhuman with super-strength and invulnerability, Mace instead received his abilities from the U.S. government's Project Patriot, which used a super-serum derived from Calvin Johnson's formula. Mace received the serum after being heralded for a heroic moment at a ceremony in [[Vienna, Austria]] following the signing of the Sokovia Accords. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in need of a new, enhanced director on the recommendation of outgoing director Coulson, Talbot and the U.S. government gave the job to Mace, who they could trust. After it was revealed that Mace's powers were a lie, Coulson decided that Mace should stay on as \"the Patriot\" and the face and political leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Coulson takes back command of S.H.I.E.L.D. operations. In the Framework, Mace is the head of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance. During the raid on the Hydra Cultivation Enlightenment Camp, Mace sacrifices himself to buy everyone time to get out of the collapsing quarantine building, resulting in his death in the real world as well.\n\nA flash-forward at the end of the third-season finale revealed that Coulson would no longer be the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the fourth season. The showrunners intentionally avoided giving hints as to who the new director would be in the sequence.<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" /> After speculation in the media about which previously introduced character could be taking on the role,<ref name=\"DirectorSpeculation\" /> it was revealed that the new leader would actually be a new character to the series portrayed by O'Mara, described as a character \"whose Marvel roots go back to the 1940s\".<ref name=\"O'Mara\" /> The character was always going to be new to the series, as the executive producers felt that replacing Coulson with someone he knows \"wouldn\u2019t [provide] as much tension to mine from\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> The character was revealed to be Mace and an Inhuman with super strength with his introduction in \"Meet the New Boss\".<ref name=\"402Recap\" /><ref name=\"DirectorMace\" /><ref name=\"DirectorMace2\" /> O'Mara, a big Marvel fan as a child who has worked a lot with ABC, found out that Marvel was \"really seriously\" interested in him for the part in the same call that his agent told him that his [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] pilot ''The Infamous'' was not getting picked up to series. Within 24 hours, O'Mara had talked to Loeb, watched some of the third season of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and accepted an offer to join the season without reading a script for it. He described the character as \"high status\", saying that \"he comes in and he's the boss, telling the other characters orders. Here I come in after [the other actors] been doing this for four years and I'm telling them what to do. It's a little awkward\".<ref name=\"O'MaraJoining\" />\n\n====Ellen Nadeer====\nEllen Nadeer (portrayed by [[Parminder Nagra]])<ref name=\"Nagra\" /><ref name=\"NagraRole\" /> is a senator and leader of the Humans First movement, who hates Inhumans after her mother's death during the Chitauri invasion. Her hatred of Inhumans comes from misunderstanding their origins believing them to be aliens who have taken over the bodies of people. She fears that an invasion will happen, when all Inhumans are just a new minority on Earth. Ellen even attempts to kill her brother Vijay, who resisted Terrigenesis for seven months before being freed. This results in him cocooning a second time. Nadeer allies herself with the Watchdogs as their benefactor. When high-ranking Watchdog Tucker Shockley tests Nadeer's humanity with a Terrigen crystal, it reveals his own explosive Inhuman abilities. Nadeer and those with her die in the ensuing explosion.\n\n====Burrows====\nBurrows (portrayed by [[Patrick Cavanaugh]])<ref name=\"403Synopsis\" /> is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Public relations|PR]] division loyal to Mace. He dies during the ambush on the airplane that Coulson and Mace are on. In the Framework, Burrows is part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\n====Eli Morrow====\n{{further|Eli Morrow}}\nElias \"Eli\" Morrow (portrayed by [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]) is the uncle of Robbie and Gabe Reyes, and engineer who helped raise his nephews. After his coworkers at Momentum Energy labs began experimenting with the ''Darkhold'', Morrow came to crave its power for himself. He put Joseph Bauer into a coma trying to find the book, and ultimately turned the rest of his coworkers into ghost-like beings. S.H.I.E.L.D. breaks him out of prison believing him to be a victim, but he uses the ''Darkhold'' to create a machine that gives him the power to create matter. Ghost Rider drags Eli and himself into another dimension.\n\nThe comics version of Eli Morrow is a [[Satanist]] who, after dying, possesses his nephew Robbie and turns him into the Ghost Rider.<ref name=\"MorrowChange\" /> In August 2016, Whedon cautioned that the series would not necessarily be directly adapting the comics' storyline, saying, \"We can\u2019t say much about what we\u2019re going to do with [Robbie Reyes\u2019] origin, but we are doing our own spin on it. We don't want people who have read the comics to know exactly what's coming.\"<ref name=\"GROriginSpin\" /> In October, Morrow was confirmed to be appearing in the series, with Z\u00fa\u00f1iga cast.<ref name=\"404Synopsis\" /> He is changed for the series by introducing him as an apparently innocent man, and then revealing him to be as power hungry as his fellow scientists experimenting on the ''Darkhold''. The abilities he gains from his experiments have been compared to those of the comic character [[Molecule Man]].<ref name=\"MorrowChange\" />\n\n====Anton Ivanov / The Superior====\nAnton Ivanov (portrayed by [[Zach McGowan]])<ref name=\"412Synopsis\" /> is a reclusive Russian industrialist known as \"The Superior\", who champions traditional values and old-fashioned hardware over modern technology and extraterrestrial entities. He believes that Coulson is the cause of Earth's alien problems (due to pictures of him investigating unknown objects) and works with the Watchdogs, Senator Nadeer, and Holden Radcliffe to fight S.H.I.E.L.D. He is highly deluded, believing Inhumans are cheaters and monsters. After being crippled by Daisy Johnson, Aida decapitates Ivanov and creates an android body for his mind to control. Ivanov then creates multiple additional bodies for his mind to control. After finding Anton Ivanov's head, General Hale persuaded Ivanov to join up with her. His head was on a robot body when he confronts Yo-Yo so he could use the Particle Infusion Chamber. Ivanov was knocked out a window by Yo-Yo which finally killed him and deactivated his mechanical soldiers.\n\n====Hope MacKenzie====\nHope MacKenzie (portrayed by Jordan Rivera)<ref name=\"418Synopsis\" /> is Mack's daughter. She died shortly after birth in real life, but she appears alive in the Framework.

He abducts and sends Phil Coulson's group, except for Fitz, through time to the Lighthouse in the year 2091 due to a prophecy uncovered by Robin Hinton. He later helps Fitz to get to the same time to save the rest of his team. During the final battle with Kasius, Enoch and Deke sacrifice their lives to get Phil Coulson's team back to their own time.\n\nHis present day form later works to keep Fitz' body safe when their ship is attacked by a ship working for the Confederacy. When they arrive on the planet Kitson, Enoch and Fitz work to afford a way off. Enoch later detects the arrival of the Chronicom hunters. After Fitz is captured by Malachi, Enoch runs into Simmons stating that she shouldn't be here. When Enoch's boss Atarah shows up and learns what happened to Chronyca-2, Enoch suggests that Fitz and Simmons might come up with a time-traveling method to help the remaining Chronicoms save Chronyca-2 from destruction. To save Fitz and Simmons following their failure to come up with a time-travel solution, Enoch does something to disable Atarah and the Chronicoms with them and helps them escape. Back on the planet Kitson, Fitz, Simmons, and Enoch are captured by Mr. Kitson's men until Izel buys them off him. While Fitz and Simmons procure the same ship that Fitz worked on for the trip to Earth, Enoch takes his leave with a new mission to find a new home for the Chronicoms. Enoch contacts a fellow Chronicom anthropologist named Isaiah where he states that they must gather their broken civilization to rebuild. When Enoch meets with Isaiah, he learns that all the anthropologists have been reassigned to hunters including Isaiah as he attacks Enoch. Though Enoch takes over his body and saves Fitz and Simmons when Malachi leads the siege on the Lighthouse. He even uses a combination of Life Model Decoy technology and Chronicom technology to create an advanced LMD of Phil Coulson.\n\n===Introduced in season five===\n====Tess====\nTess (portrayed by [[Eve Harlow]]) is a resourceful, self-sufficient inhabitant of the Lighthouse with a hope for a better future.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> She was later hanged by the Kree with a message pinned to her demanding that Flint be brought to the Kree.

Kasius was sent to oversee the Lighthouse by his father after his failure in an earlier battle while his brother Faulnak oversaw the Kree Empire. During his fight with Mack, Kasius took a Kree medicine that removes his pain after killing future Elena. With help from Jemma, Mack was able to kill Kasius.\n\nRains' makeup takes 4 hours to apply.<ref name=\"KasiusMakeup\" />\n\n====Sinara====\nSinara (portrayed by [[Florence Faivre]])<ref name=\"501/502Synopsis\" /> is a female Kree in the year 2091 that serves as Kasius' second-in-command, enforcer, and head of the Kree Watch. She wields floating spheres which she uses to either attack her enemies or kill anyone that has offended Kasius. After most of Phil Coulson's group fled to the remains of Earth, Kasius sent Sinara to dispose of them. During the gravity storm fight with Daisy Johnson aboard the modified Zephyr-One, Sinara was killed when Daisy Johnson impaled her with a pipe.\n\nFaivre's makeup takes 3.5 hours to apply.<ref name=\"SinaraMakeup\" />\n\n====Grill====\nGrill (portrayed by [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]]) is a \"gruff taskmaster\" of the Lighthouse's junkyard with an unforgiving temperament, who does not have illusions about the world he lives in.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> When Grill finds out about Yo-Yo, Flint's Inhuman ability manifests where he kills Grill with assembled rocks in self-defense.\n\nVince was announced in the role in November 2017.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" />\n\n====Flint====\n{{Further|Flint (Marvel Comics)}}\nFlint (portrayed by [[Coy Stewart]]) is a young man and inhabitant of the Lighthouse looking to make something of himself, and to prove that he is capable of big things.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" /> He later underwent Terrigenesis where he developed geokinesis which he first used to kill Grill in self-defense. Flint later helps Mack and Yo-Yo into getting rid of the attacking Vrellnexians that were unleashed on Kasius' orders as part of his retribution on Phil Coulson's group. Before dying, an elderly Robin Hinton tells Melinda May about a vision that involves Flint which she had when she was still a child. After rebuilding the Monolith with the rocks he made, Flint joins Tess on the trawler. Upon sensing that Coulson's group made it through the Monolith, Flint and Tess work to rebuild Earth with Flint using a globe as a blueprint.\n\nIn season 6, Izel uses the Di'Allas energies to create a clone of Flint from Mack and Yo-Yo's memories in order to help her rebuild said Monoliths. After possessing Flint to rebuild the Di'Allas, Izel possessed Yo-Yo and broke Flint's leg. Flint is evacuated by Piper.\n\nStewart was announced in the role in November 2017. The role is based on a character of the same name from the ''Inhumans'' comics.<ref name=\"S5Newcomers\" />\n\n====Hale====\nHale (portrayed by [[Catherine Dent]]) is a female brigadier general and the mother of Ruby who hunts Phil Coulson's group after what happened to Glenn Talbot.<ref name=\"Cameron\" /> Alyssa Jirrels portrays a teenage Hale.<ref name=\"515Synopsis\" /> During her teenage life, she is a rival of Baron Strucker and a classmate of Jasper Sitwell. Daniel Whitehall selected her to bring up Hydra's next leader through insemination. Later on, she came across an alien device that enabled her to contact Qovas of an alien alliance called the Confederacy. It's her weariness of the Confederacy that led to General Hale's attempts to get S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra to work together. She soon teams up with Carl Creel and Anton Ivanov. Following Ruby's death, Hale informs Qovas that S.H.I.E.L.D. now has the gravitonium. After Talbot absorbs the gravitonium and takes command of Qovas' ship, Hale tries to control him through his Hydra reprogramming, but he rebels and crushes Hale with his powers.\n\n====Ruby Hale====\nRuby Hale (portrayed by [[Dove Cameron]]) is the daughter of General Hale who has an obsession with Daisy Johnson.<ref name=\"Cameron\" /> She has been trained as an assassin by her mother and wields [[chakram]]s which she used to slice half of Elena's arms off when she was attacking Mack.<ref name=\"CameronEW\" /> It was revealed that she was born through insemination. When Ruby gets 8% of the gravitonium in her, she starts to hear Franklin Hall and Ian Quinn's voices in her head like Carl Creel which leads to her accidentally killing Werner von Strucker. After attempts by Daisy Johnson and General Hale to get her to let them help, Elena had no choice but to use one of Ruby's chakrams to put her out of her misery, and takes her revenge against Ruby for having sliced her arms.\n\nIn November 2017, Marvel revealed that Dove Cameron had joined the season in an unspecified role,<ref name=\"CameronReveal\" /> which was revealed in January 2018 to be the character Ruby.<ref name=\"CameronJan2018\" /> Cameron described Ruby as \"a very interesting, complex, dark girl\" and \"a wild card\".<ref name=\"CameronEW\" /><ref name=\"CameronCBR\" /> When auditioning for the role, Cameron, who did not know anything about Ruby or the character, played her like a murderer, which the producers liked. This helped Cameron once she was cast in the role and learned that Ruby was some form of assassin.<ref name=\"CameronEW\" /> Regarding Ruby's relationship with her mother, Cameron felt the relationship was \"complex\" with both of these strong women. She continued, \"there\u2019s also a lot of love there. It\u2019s like a real, complicated mother-daughter relationship. It\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very gratifying. It\u2019s very scary. It\u2019s very fast. It\u2019s very physical.\"<ref name=\"CameronCBR\" />\n\n====Qovas====\nQovas (portrayed by [[Peter Mensah]]) is a Remorath representative of the Confederacy that General Hale answers to.<ref name=\"Mensah\" /> Qovas pursues the gravitonium S.H.I.E.L.D. has in their possession, by sending Remorath warriors down to the Lighthouse. This ends with the Remorath warriors being killed by a gravitonium-enhanced Glenn Talbot. During his fight with May where he is defeated, Qovas launches ionizing missiles intended to strike the Lighthouse, only to find out that Deke changed the coordinates to strike his ship, killing him.\n\n===Introduced in season six===\n====Marcus Benson====\nMarcus Benson (portrayed by [[Barry Shabaka Henley]]) is a Natural Science professor and colleague of Andrew Garner who May recruited to offer his scientific expertise to S.H.I.E.L.D. He later gained an airplane to head to Central America where he found information about Izel. Izel summons him to the Zephyr while possessing Mack for the location of a temple she needs. She torments him with an  apparition of Benson's deceased husband Thomas, whom claims Benson was drunk when he ordered Thomas off life-support following a car accident. Benson gives up the location. Mack and Yo-Yo are able to send him to safety by ejecting him from the plane's containment unit to notify S.H.I.E.L.D. of Izel's location.\n\n====Keller====\nKeller (portrayed by [[Lucas Bryant]]) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who becomes Yo-Yo's secondary love interest while Mack is busy. After he gets possessed by a Shrike and starts to crystallize the area, Yo-Yo had no other choice but to use the same knife that was used on Sarge's previous victim to kill the parasite at the cost of Keller's life.\n\n====Jaco====\nJaco (portrayed by Winston James Francis) is a smart and strong unspecified alien mercenary who is a member of Sarge's group. He was the runt of the litter of his family and wanted to be a baker until his family was \"turned into fertilizer.\" When it came to the fight at Deke Shaw's tech company, Jaco was subdued by Deke and Mack using the Framework simulation. After pretending to have died from being unable to breath Earth's atmosphere, Jaco revealed his fire-breathing abilities before Daisy knocked him out. After helping to rescue FitzSimmons from Izel's ship, Jaco sacrifices his life to blow up the Lazy Comet with Sarge's nuke.\n\n====Snowflake====\nSnowflake (portrayed by [[Brooke Williams]]) is spacey yet lethal woman who is a member of Sarge's group and has a fascination with death and resurrection. She later falls in love with Deke after being abandoned by Sarge, who put his revenge over her safety.

When it came to the fight at Deke Shaw's tech company, Pax was hit with an Icer. During a mission to take on Izel aboard her ship following the hijacking of Zephyr One, Pax is pushed face first into a Shelter Charge (a force field generating device Sarge brought) by Yo-Yo. While Jaco wanted to get him medical attention, Sarge chose to shoot him, believing he was slowing him down in his pursuit for revenge.\n\n====Malachi====\nMalachi (portrayed by Christopher James Baker) is a Chronicom hunter from Chronyca-2 who targets Fitz and answers to Atarah. He wields special chakrams that enable him to teleport anywhere. During a fight between the Chronicom hunters and Quake on Kitson, Malachi makes off with Fitz after he briefly reunited with Simmons. When Atarah starts to get impatient with FitzSimmons not being able to solve time travel, Malachi, Atarah, and the Chronicoms with them are disabled by Enoch, who takes Malachi's chakrams to teleport himself, Fitz, and Simmons away. Malachi later turns down Baal-Gad's offer to hunt down Fitz and Simmons; revealing that they have a copy of their brains in the Cerebral Fusion Machine. After acquiring the information he needed, Malachi recommends to Atarah that they establish a Chronyca-3, but she's adamant that Chronyca-2 can be still be saved. Malachi responds by shooting her and ordering his fellow Chronicoms to hunt down two targets. This leads him to reassigning all Chronicom anthropologists to hunters and lead a siege on the Lighthouse. Though Enoch managed to save Fitz, Simmons, and those with them, Malachi was able to take the Lighthouse and Fury's black box.\n\n====Izel====\nIzel (portrayed by [[Karolina Wydra]]) is a mysterious, red-haired, non-corporeal alien mercenary who buys Fitz, Simmons, and Enoch from Mr. Kitson so they could help her on a mission to Earth to find her Di'Allas (the monoliths the S.H.I.E.L.D. team encountered in the past). She is later revealed to be the creator of the Shrikes and has been targeted by Sarge ever since she eliminated his family. After the destruction of her ship, Izel starts possessing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in order to access Mack; resulting in Sarge getting shot and Davis' death. After recovering and healing, Sarge broke free and confronts Izel where the Gravitonium generator holding the Di'Allas' energies is. Sarge was left confused when Izel claims that he is from a non-corporeal world like her and that the \"family\" is Coulson's memories of his team. When she emerges from the room, Yo-Yo throws herself in front of Daisy to keep her from being possessed. Mack agrees to go along with Izel to keep her from causing more S.H.I.E.L.D. casualties and to protect Yo-Yo. Upon getting information about a specific temple from Benson, Izel keeps Mack and Yo-Yo around to help her rebuild the three Di'Allas; using their energies to manifest a clone of Flint from their memories. She possesses him and recreates the Di'Allas. Afterwards, she possesses Yo-Yo to break Flint's leg. When Izel was confronted by Sarge, he was unable to kill her, stabbed May, and sent her to the other side of the portal as a sign. Due to the nature of Izel's world, May was able to prevent the ritual from that end, causing Izel to fight May. After briefly making it back to Earth, Izel finds Sarge fighting Mack and Daisy. Once May appeared and impaled Izel with the sword, the remaining Shrike melted into goo freeing those who were possessed.\n\nIzel is based on the Mayan Goddess [[Ixchel]] from the comics and Mayan mythology.\n\n==Guest characters==\nThe following is a supplementary list of guest stars that appear in lesser roles, make significant [[cameo appearances]] or who receive co-starring credit over multiple appearances.

The city's [[authoritarian]] mayor, Kenji Kobayashi, ratifies an official decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, which is immediately approved despite the insistence of Professor Watanabe, the mayor's political opponent who states he is close to creating a cure for the dog flu. The first canine deported from the city is a white and black-spotted dog named Spots Kobayashi, who served as the [[bodyguard]] dog of 12-year-old [[orphan]] Atari Kobayashi, the mayor's distant nephew and [[Ward (law)|ward]].  \n\nSix months later, Atari hijacks a plane and flies it to Trash Island (now nicknamed \"Isle of Dogs\") to search for Spots. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a dog pack led by an all-black canine named Chief, a lifelong stray. With their help Atari first finds a locked cage that presumably contains Spots' skeleton, but learns that it is not him. They then fend off a rescue team sent by Mayor Kobayashi to retrieve Atari. Atari decides to continue his search for Spots, and the pack decides to help him, but Chief declines because of his refusal to have a human \"master\". He is then convinced by Nutmeg, a female ex-[[show dog]], to help the boy out of obligation. The pack seeks advice from sage-like dogs Jupiter and Oracle, who surmise that Spots might be held captive by an isolated tribe of dogs rumored to be [[Cannibalism|cannibals]]. \n\nMeanwhile, Watanabe finally develops a successful serum and shows the results to Kobayashi, who dismisses the results and refuses to lift the dog ban. The professor objects, only to be put under [[house arrest]] and killed by a piece of poisoned [[sushi]] by orders of the mayor's [[Hatchet man (idiom)|hatchet man]], [[Majordomo|Major Domo]]. Tracy Walker, an American [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] and member of a pro-dog activist group, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. It is revealed that Mayor Kobayashi and his political party are actually responsible for the dog flu outbreak, seeking to eliminate the dogs as Kobayashi's cat-loving ancestors tried to do 1,000 years ago, who were foiled by a legendary [[samurai]] boy that closely resembled Atari.  \n\nDuring their journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others. Atari gives Chief a bath, revealing his white and black-spotted coat, and that he bears a striking resemblance to Spots. The two finally begin to bond and rejoin the rest of the pack, but are ambushed by another rescue team. Spots then arrives with the dog tribe and help Atari's group to escape. Spots confirms that he is Chief's older brother and that he was rescued by the dog tribe, who are former test subjects from a secret lab that was abandoned after a [[tsunami]]. Spots became their leader and mated with a female tribe member named Peppermint, who is pregnant with their first litter. Because of these circumstances, Spots requests for Atari to transfer his protection duties to Chief; both Atari and Chief accept. An [[owl]] later brings word that Kobayashi has rounded up all the exiled dogs and plans to exterminate them with poison gas. \n\nTracy confronts Watanabe's closest colleague [[Yoko Ono]], who confirms Tracy's conspiracy theories and gives her the last vial of the serum. At his re-election ceremony, Mayor Kobayashi prepares to give the extermination order when Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption. Kobayashi then revokes her transfer license, meaning that Tracy would no longer be allowed to study as a transfer student. Atari and the dogs soon arrive, and confirm the serum works by testing it on Chief and curing him. Atari addresses the crowd and recites a [[haiku]] he wrote and dedicated to Kobayashi, rekindling the sympathy that once existed between dogs and humans. Touched by Atari's words, Kobayashi officially rescinds the Trash Island decree. Angered, Major Domo has a robot dog attack Kobayashi; Spots destroys it with one of his military-issued explosive teeth, but he and Atari are gravely injured in the process. Domo then presses the button to trigger the extermination, only to have the extermination equipment and robots to malfunction and fail due to sabotage from Tracy's activist group. Atari and Spots are taken to a hospital, where Kobayashi donates one of his [[kidney]]s to save his nephew.\n\nOne month later, Atari becomes the new mayor of Megasaki due to a legal [[statute]] in Kobayashi's stead, and has all dogs reintegrated into society and cured of the dog flu, while Kobayashi and his co-conspirators are all jailed for [[political corruption]]. Tracy (whose license was reinstated) and Atari become a couple, while Chief becomes Atari's new bodyguard dog and starts a relationship with Nutmeg. Meanwhile, Spots (recovering from his injuries) has had a statue erected in his honor, and resumes raising his litter with Peppermint under the care of a monk at a [[Shinto]] temple.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast order and character names now match the BFI page. -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Chief, a [[stray dog]]\n* Koyu Rankin as Atari Kobayashi, a young boy on the search for his dog, Spots\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Rex\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as King\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Duke, a [[Siberian Husky]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Boss, a baseball team's [[mascot]]\n* [[Kunichi Nomura]] as Mayor Kenji Kobayashi, the mayor of Megasaki\n* [[Akira Takayama]] as Major Domo\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Tracy Walker, a [[foreign student exchange|foreign exchange]] student from [[Ohio]]\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Interpreter Nelson<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n* Akira Ito as Professor Watanabe, the professor whose antidote was rejected by the mayor\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nutmeg, a [[show dog]]\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Gondo<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n* [[F.

Much of the Japanese dialogue has been pared down to simple statements that non-speakers can figure out based on context and facial expressions\". Angie Han, writing in ''[[Mashable]]'', calls the American exchange student character Tracy a \"classic example of the 'white savior' archetype\u2014the well-meaning white hero who arrives in a foreign land and saves its people from themselves\".<ref name=\"Clift\"/>\n\nWhile this critique has created some furore on the film's release, Chang has said that his review had been taken out of context and turned into a \"battle cry\" on Twitter, adding, \"I wasn't offended; nor was I looking to be offended\".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2018/03/22/wes-andersons-isle-dogs-sparks-controversy-depiction-japan/ | title=Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs sparks controversy over depiction of Japan | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | author=Telegraph Reporters | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] | date=March 22, 2018 | accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref> Another Japanese-American perspective was provided by Emily Yoshida, writing in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, that these concerns had been \"seen before in debates about Asian culture as reflected by Western culture\u2014perspectives can vary wildly between Asian-Americans and immigrated Asians, and what feels like tribute to some feels like opportunism to others\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Yoshida | first=Emily | title=What It's Like to Watch Isle of Dogs As a Japanese Speaker | url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/what-its-like-to-watch-isle-of-dogs-as-a-japanese-speaker.html| website=Vulture | publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media]] | date=March 29, 2018 | accessdate=April 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWriting for BuzzFeed, Alison Willmore found \"no overt malicious intent to ''Isle of Dogs''{{'}} [[cultural tourism]], but it's marked by a hodgepodge of references that an American like Anderson might cough up if pressed to [[Free association (psychology)|free associate]] about Japan\u2014[[taiko]] drummers, [[anime]], [[Hokusai]], [[sumo]], [[kabuki]], [[haiku]], [[cherry blossom]]s, and a [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|mushroom cloud]] (!). ...

Fujii wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Anderson's decision not to subtitle the Japanese speakers struck me as a carefully considered artistic choice. ''Isle of Dogs'' is profoundly interested in the humor and fallibility of translation ... This is the beating heart of the film: there is no such thing as \"true\" translation.

This is a sly subversion, in which the Japanese evince an agency independent of foreign validation. Indeed, to say that the scene dehumanizes the Japanese is to assume the primacy of an English-speaking audience.

The city's [[authoritarian]] mayor, Kenji Kobayashi, ratifies an official decree banishing all dogs to Trash Island, which is immediately approved despite the insistence of Professor Watanabe, the mayor's political opponent who states he is close to creating a cure for the dog flu. The first canine deported from the city is a white and black-spotted dog named Spots Kobayashi, who served as the [[bodyguard]] dog of 12-year-old [[orphan]] Atari Kobayashi, the mayor's distant nephew and [[Ward (law)|ward]].  \n\nSix months later, Atari hijacks a plane and flies it to Trash Island (now nicknamed \"Isle of Dogs\") to search for Spots. After crash-landing, Atari is rescued by a dog pack led by an all-black canine named Chief, a lifelong stray. With their help Atari first finds a locked cage that presumably contains Spots' skeleton, but learns that it is not him. They then fend off a rescue team sent by Mayor Kobayashi to retrieve Atari. Atari decides to continue his search for Spots, and the pack decides to help him, but Chief declines because of his refusal to have a human \"master\". He is then convinced by Nutmeg, a female ex-[[show dog]], to help the boy out of obligation. The pack seeks advice from sage-like dogs Jupiter and Oracle, who surmise that Spots might be held captive by an isolated tribe of dogs rumored to be [[Cannibalism|cannibals]]. \n\nMeanwhile, Watanabe finally develops a successful serum and shows the results to Kobayashi, who dismisses the results and refuses to lift the dog ban. The professor objects, only to be put under [[house arrest]] and killed by a piece of poisoned [[sushi]] by orders of the mayor's [[Hatchet man (idiom)|hatchet man]], [[Majordomo|Major Domo]]. Tracy Walker, an American [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] and member of a pro-dog activist group, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. It is revealed that Mayor Kobayashi and his political party are actually responsible for the dog flu outbreak, seeking to eliminate the dogs as Kobayashi's cat-loving ancestors tried to do 1,000 years ago, who were foiled by a legendary [[samurai]] boy that closely resembled Atari.  \n\nDuring their journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others. Atari gives Chief a bath, revealing his white and black-spotted coat, and that he bears a striking resemblance to Spots. The two finally begin to bond and rejoin the rest of the pack, but are ambushed by another rescue team. Spots then arrives with the dog tribe and help Atari's group to escape. Spots confirms that he is Chief's older brother and that he was rescued by the dog tribe, who are former test subjects from a secret lab that was abandoned after a [[tsunami]]. Spots became their leader and mated with a female tribe member named Peppermint, who is pregnant with their first litter. Because of these circumstances, Spots requests for Atari to transfer his protection duties to Chief; both Atari and Chief accept. An [[owl]] later brings word that Kobayashi has rounded up all the exiled dogs and plans to exterminate them with poison gas. \n\nTracy confronts Watanabe's closest colleague [[Yoko Ono]], who confirms Tracy's conspiracy theories and gives her the last vial of the serum. At his re-election ceremony, Mayor Kobayashi prepares to give the extermination order when Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption. Kobayashi then revokes her transfer license, meaning that Tracy would no longer be allowed to study as a transfer student. Atari and the dogs soon arrive, and confirm the serum works by testing it on Chief and curing him. Atari addresses the crowd and recites a [[haiku]] he wrote and dedicated to Kobayashi, rekindling the sympathy that once existed between dogs and humans. Touched by Atari's words, Kobayashi officially rescinds the Trash Island decree. Angered, Major Domo has a robot dog attack Kobayashi; Spots destroys it with one of his military-issued explosive teeth, but he and Atari are gravely injured in the process. Domo then presses the button to trigger the extermination, only to have the extermination equipment and robots to malfunction and fail due to sabotage from Tracy's activist group. Atari and Spots are taken to a hospital, where Kobayashi donates one of his [[kidney]]s to save his nephew.\n\nOne month later, Atari becomes the new mayor of Megasaki due to a legal [[statute]] in Kobayashi's stead, and has all dogs reintegrated into society and cured of the dog flu, while Kobayashi and his co-conspirators are all jailed for [[political corruption]]. Tracy (whose license was reinstated) and Atari become a couple, while Chief becomes Atari's new bodyguard dog and starts a relationship with Nutmeg.

Fujii wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Anderson's decision not to subtitle the Japanese speakers struck me as a carefully considered artistic choice. ''Isle of Dogs'' is profoundly interested in the humor and fallibility of translation ... This is the beating heart of the film: there is no such thing as \"true\" translation. Everything is interpreted. Translation is malleable and implicated, always, by systems of power ...

This is a sly subversion, in which the Japanese evince an agency independent of foreign validation. Indeed, to say that the scene dehumanizes the Japanese is to assume the primacy of an English-speaking audience. Such logic replicates the very tyranny of language that ''Isle of Dogs'' attempts to erode.<ref name=\":1\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|References}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\"| [[Academy Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[91st Academy Awards|February 24, 2019]]\n| [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]]\n| [[Wes Anderson]], [[Scott Rudin]], [[Steven M.

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}. For the other laypeople, see {{harvtxt |Churn Law |2000 |p=464}}.}} In this case, a rich householder was in doubt as to who he should will his inheritance to, his pious nephew or his own son. He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

The question that might have been raised is whether issuing laws would not normally be associated with kings. The ''[[Apadana|Apad\u0101na]]'' explains this by relating that Up\u0101li had been an all-powerful [[cakravartin|wheel-turning king]] for thousand previous lives, and a king of the [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]] in another thousand lives.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |1996 |p=126 note 27}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. Huxley mentions the question raised.}} Before that, the texts say he was born during the age of [[Padumuttara Buddha]] and met one of that [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]'s disciples who was foremost in monastic discipline.

This is also explained in an ''Apad\u0101na'' story: in a previous life, Up\u0101li insulted a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratyekabuddha|italic=yes}}; a type of Buddha). The evil [[karma in Buddhism|karma]] brought about low birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nUp\u0101li was the focus of worship in ancient and medieval India and was regarded as the \"patron saint\" of monks who specialize in the ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Hsuan Tsang}} He is one of the [[eight enlightened disciples]], and is honored in Burmese ceremonies.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn|Strong |1992 |p=240}}\n\n=== Schools and lineages ===\n[[File:Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra on 1890 map of Anuradhapura.svg|1890 map showing the historical location of the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra, drawn by a British civil servant |alt=Map of Anurudhapura, the city that included the Mahvihara |thumb]]\nSeveral scholars have contended that the prominence of certain of the Buddha's disciples in the early texts is indicative of the preference of the compilers. Buddhologist [[Jean Przyluski]] argued that Up\u0101li's prominence in the P\u0101li texts is indicative of the preference of the [[Sthavira]]v\u0101dins for ''vinaya'' above [[sutra|discourse]], whereas the prominence of \u0100nanda in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts is indicative of their preference for discourse above ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=13, 464\u2013465}}{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |pp=22\u201323}} This preference of the compilers has also affected how \u0100nanda addresses Up\u0101li.<!--34-35--> In many of the early discourses Up\u0101li has little to no role,<!--88--> and he is not mentioned among many early lists of significant disciples.<!--89--> He is, however, frequently mentioned in lists in the ''Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka'', which only proves the point. Up\u0101li seems to obtain a much more significant role with the end of the Buddha's life.<!--110-->{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=34\u201335, 88\u201389, 110}} Przyluski's theory, which was further developed by Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Migot]], regarded [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}), Up\u0101li and [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}) as part of the second period in the compiling of the early texts (4th to early 3rd century BCE) that emphasized [[\u015b\u012bla|moral discipline]], associated with these disciples, as well as the city of [[Vesali|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015bal\u012b}}).{{refn |group=note |Although Przyluski connected this with the city of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kau\u015bamb\u012b}}) instead.{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |p=184}}}} In this period, these disciples' roles and stories were emphasized and embellished more than other disciples.{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} These differences in schools gradually developed and became stereotyped over time.{{sfn |Dutt |1925 |pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nUp\u0101li's successors formed a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] called the ''vinayadharas'', or the 'custodians of the vinaya'.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=3}}{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=2}} ''Vinayadharas'' were monks who in [[early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]] were particularly known for their mastery and strictness with regard to the ''vinaya''. In 4th<!--2-->\u20135th-century<!--3--> [[Ceylon]], they then came to be associated with a lineage of such masters,<!--2--> because of the influence of Buddhaghosa, who established Up\u0101li and the other ''vinayadharas'' as an important characteristic<!--3--> of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra]] tradition.<!--12--> This concept of a ''vinayadhara'' lineage also affected Burma, and led to a belief that only those ordained in the proper lineage could become ''vinayadharas''.<!--3--> Gradually, the ''vinayadhara'' came to be seen a sign of superior tradition, as the lineage was integrated with local history.<!--12--> Even later, the ''vinayadhara'' became a formal position<!--14--> of judge and arbitrator in problems of ''vinaya''.<!--4-->{{sfn |Frasch |1996 |pp=2\u20134, 12, 14}}\n\nUp\u0101li's lineage has gained scholarly attention because of their way of timekeeping, known by modern scholars as the \"dotted record\". Chinese sources say that Up\u0101li and his successors had a custom to insert a dot in a manuscript marking each year after the First Council. The sources claim that each of successors continued this tradition, up until 489 CE, when the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] scholar [[Sa\u1e43ghabhadra]] entered the last dot in the manuscript. This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error.

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}. For the other laypeople, see {{harvtxt |Churn Law |2000 |p=464}}.}} In this case, a rich householder was in doubt as to who he should will his inheritance to, his pious nephew or his own son. He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

Huxley mentions the question raised.}} Before that, the texts say he was born during the age of [[Padumuttara Buddha]] and met one of that [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]'s disciples who was foremost in monastic discipline. Up\u0101li aspired to be like him, and pursued it through doing [[merit (Buddhism)|merits]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\nDespite Up\u0101li's previous lives as a king, he was born as a low caste barber in the time of [[Gotama Buddha]]. This is also explained in an ''Apad\u0101na'' story: in a previous life, Up\u0101li insulted a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratyekabuddha|italic=yes}}; a type of Buddha). The evil [[karma in Buddhism|karma]] brought about low birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nUp\u0101li was the focus of worship in ancient and medieval India and was regarded as the \"patron saint\" of monks who specialize in the ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Hsuan Tsang}} He is one of the [[eight enlightened disciples]], and is honored in Burmese ceremonies.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn|Strong |1992 |p=240}}\n\n=== Schools and lineages ===\n[[File:Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra on 1890 map of Anuradhapura.svg|1890 map showing the historical location of the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra, drawn by a British civil servant |alt=Map of Anurudhapura, the city that included the Mahvihara |thumb]]\nSeveral scholars have contended that the prominence of certain of the Buddha's disciples in the early texts is indicative of the preference of the compilers. Buddhologist [[Jean Przyluski]] argued that Up\u0101li's prominence in the P\u0101li texts is indicative of the preference of the [[Sthavira]]v\u0101dins for ''vinaya'' above [[sutra|discourse]], whereas the prominence of \u0100nanda in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts is indicative of their preference for discourse above ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=13, 464\u2013465}}{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |pp=22\u201323}} This preference of the compilers has also affected how \u0100nanda addresses Up\u0101li.<!--34-35--> In many of the early discourses Up\u0101li has little to no role,<!--88--> and he is not mentioned among many early lists of significant disciples.<!--89--> He is, however, frequently mentioned in lists in the ''Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka'', which only proves the point. Up\u0101li seems to obtain a much more significant role with the end of the Buddha's life.<!--110-->{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=34\u201335, 88\u201389, 110}} Przyluski's theory, which was further developed by Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Migot]], regarded [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}), Up\u0101li and [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}) as part of the second period in the compiling of the early texts (4th to early 3rd century BCE) that emphasized [[\u015b\u012bla|moral discipline]], associated with these disciples, as well as the city of [[Vesali|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015bal\u012b}}).{{refn |group=note |Although Przyluski connected this with the city of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kau\u015bamb\u012b}}) instead.{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |p=184}}}} In this period, these disciples' roles and stories were emphasized and embellished more than other disciples.{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} These differences in schools gradually developed and became stereotyped over time.{{sfn |Dutt |1925 |pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nUp\u0101li's successors formed a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] called the ''vinayadharas'', or the 'custodians of the vinaya'.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=3}}{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=2}} ''Vinayadharas'' were monks who in [[early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]] were particularly known for their mastery and strictness with regard to the ''vinaya''. In 4th<!--2-->\u20135th-century<!--3--> [[Ceylon]], they then came to be associated with a lineage of such masters,<!--2--> because of the influence of Buddhaghosa, who established Up\u0101li and the other ''vinayadharas'' as an important characteristic<!--3--> of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra]] tradition.<!--12--> This concept of a ''vinayadhara'' lineage also affected Burma, and led to a belief that only those ordained in the proper lineage could become ''vinayadharas''.<!--3--> Gradually, the ''vinayadhara'' came to be seen a sign of superior tradition, as the lineage was integrated with local history.<!--12--> Even later, the ''vinayadhara'' became a formal position<!--14--> of judge and arbitrator in problems of ''vinaya''.<!--4-->{{sfn |Frasch |1996 |pp=2\u20134, 12, 14}}\n\nUp\u0101li's lineage has gained scholarly attention because of their way of timekeeping, known by modern scholars as the \"dotted record\". Chinese sources say that Up\u0101li and his successors had a custom to insert a dot in a manuscript marking each year after the First Council. The sources claim that each of successors continued this tradition, up until 489 CE, when the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] scholar [[Sa\u1e43ghabhadra]] entered the last dot in the manuscript. This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error. It was believed at the time that Ku-hsin was a reincarnation of Up\u0101li.{{refn |For Ku-hsin, the Pa Hwa Hills, the standard and the reincarnation, see {{harvtxt |Hsiang-Kuang |1956 |p=207}}.

Much of this is found in the ''[[Pariv\u0101ra]]'', a late ''vinaya'' text.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Bareau has suggested the conversation between the Buddha and Up\u0101li about schisms was the origin of the traditions about this subject in the ''Vinayapi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=169}} In the ''vinaya'' texts of the Sarvastiv\u0101da tradition, the ''Uttragrantha''{{sfn

P\u0101li at all.{{sfn |Norman |1983 |p=29}} With regard to these lists of questions, it is unknown which of these questions are from Up\u0101li, and which were attributed to him because of his

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived.

The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]] (KGL). All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were Peninsular War veterans.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=484}} In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|Captain [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer]] [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], thought the Brunswickers \"...perfect children.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other ([[Baron Charles-Francois Bourgeois|Bourgeois]]') was to attack the eastern side of the same post.{{sfn|Haweis|1908|p=228}}\n\nThe divisions were to advance in [[echelon (formation)|echelon]] from the left at a distance of 400 paces apart\u2014the 2nd Division ([[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot]]'s) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division ([[Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet|Marcognet]]'s) next, and the 4th Division ([[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Durutte|Durutte]]'s) on the right.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road.{{efn|Website of current Dutch historian<!--s: Erwin van Muilwijk: [http://home.tiscali.nl/erwinmuilwijk/index.htm Tiscali.nl], and... website no longer contains the referenced sources--> Marco Bijl: [http://www.8militia.net/ 8militia.net];{{Harvnb|Eenens|1879|pp=14\u201330, 131\u2013198}}; De Jongh, W.A.: Veldtocht van den Jare 1815, Historisch verhaal; in De Nieuwe Militaire Spectator (Nijmegen 1866), pp. 13\u201327.(This is the original account of Colonel de Jongh, commander of the Dutch 8th Militia.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

British cavalry troopers also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training. They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, cavalier in attitude, and unlike the infantry some units had scant experience of warfare.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=140\u2013142}} The Scots Greys, for example, had not been in action since 1795.{{sfn|Grant|1972|p=17}} According to Wellington, though they were superior individual horsemen, they were inflexible and lacked tactical ability.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=140\u2013142}} \"I considered one squadron a match for two French, I didn't like to see four British opposed to four French: and as the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary I was the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in numbers.\"{{sfn|Oman|Hall|1902|p=119}}\n\nThe two brigades had a combined field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they charged with the 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=188}}{{efn|The Royal Horse Guards (2 squadrons) were in reserve for the Household Brigade (9 or 10 squadrons strong) but the Union Brigade (9 squadrons) had no reserve (''Letter 5'', {{harvnb|Siborne<!--HT-->|1891|pp=7\u201310}}; ''Letter 16'' {{harvnb|Glover|2004}}).

He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded.

At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them.

He later served in the Russian Army.}}\n\n{{quote|\nIn my opinion, four principal causes led to this disaster:\n\nThe first, and most influential, was the arrival, skilfully combined, of Bl\u00fccher, and the false movement that favoured this arrival;{{efn|This \"false movement\" was the detachment of Grouchy's force in pursuit of the Prussians: Napoleon had overestimated the extent of his victory at Ligny and underestimated the resilience of the Prussians. He also seems to have discounted the presence of B\u00fclow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.}} the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.|Antoine-Henri Jomini.{{sfn|Jomini|1864|pp=223, 224}} }}\n\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\n\n{{quote|\nBonaparte and the authors who support him have always attempted to portray the great catastrophes that befell him as the result of chance. They seek to make their readers believe that through his great wisdom and extraordinary energy the whole project had already moved forward with the greatest confidence, that complete success was but a hair's breadth away, when treachery, accident, or even fate, as they sometimes call it, ruined everything. He and his supporters do not want to admit that huge mistakes, sheer recklessness, and, above all, overreaching ambition that exceeded all realistic possibilities, were the true causes.|Carl von Clausewitz.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Feldzug von 1815 (''Campaign of 1815'')|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm#Ch3 Chapter 3]''}} }}\n\nWellington himself wrote in his official dispatch back to London:\n\n{{quote|I should not do justice to my own feelings, or to Marshal Bl\u00fccher and the Prussian army, if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General B\u00fclow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded\".<ref name=\"Gazette, 17028\"/>}}\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the ''Campaign of 1815'' and ''Wellington's famous 1842 essay'' in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay]''}} Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|pp=144\u2013145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'')}}\n\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. .... Bl\u00fccher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat\".{{sfn|Parkinson|2000|pp=240\u2013241}} Steele (2014) writes: \"Bl\u00fccher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Bl\u00fccher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank, Wellington was able to shift to the offensive\".{{sfn|Steele|2014|p=178}}\n\n==Battlefield today==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:0 Braine-l'Alleud 051012 (1).JPG|thumb|The [[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo]]\n\nSome portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\".{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|p=345}} In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument. The [[Lion's Mound]], a giant artificial hill, was constructed here using {{convert|300000|m3|cuyd}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.\n\n{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on 18&nbsp;June 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10218931/Rescuing-the-farm-where-Wellington-won-the-battle-of-Waterloo.html|title=Rescuing the farm where Wellington won the battle of Waterloo|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2013-08-02|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo.

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]].

The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

The total of casualties for the whole brigade for the day was around 800 killed and wounded {{Harv|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=310\u2013311}}.}} D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear.

Van Zuylen rallied 400 men, according to his estimate, who were ready to join the counterattack and even captured two French fanions ({{Harvnb|Bas|Wommersom|1909|pp=338\u2013341}}(vol. 3); {{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=293\u2013295}}).}} A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10218931/Rescuing-the-farm-where-Wellington-won-the-battle-of-Waterloo.html|title=Rescuing the farm where Wellington won the battle of Waterloo|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2013-08-02|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a two-[[euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2{{sfrac|1|2}} euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==Recent discovery at Mont St. Jean==\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium]], found evidence of a shooting clash that happened there between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 [[musket ball]]s and 3 amputated human leg bones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/human-remains-and-cannon-ball-unearthed-at-battle-of-waterloo-hospital-site/ |title=Human remains and cannon ball unearthed at Battle of Waterloo hospital site |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |work=[[ITV News]] |publisher=[[ITV plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/17/veterans-unearth-amputated-leg-bones-musket-balls-waterloo-field/ |title=Soldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital site |first=James |last=Crisp |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |page=16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre.

It was well preplanned, initiated by the Germans, and utterly lacked any pogrom-like spontaneity.\" Chodakiewicz's good arguments, Wr\u00f3bel wrote, are \"overshadowed by numerous flaws\", lack a sense of proportion, and make selective use of information from sources that support Chodakiewicz's view.

According to various accounts, Persak writes, the Germans had set up a ''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'' in Jedwabne, staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} The police reportedly set up a \"collaborationist civilian town council\" led by a former mayor, Marian Karolak. Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. The town council is reported to have included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939.

The second group was \"led into a wooden, thatched barn owned by Bronis\u0142aw \u015aleszy\u0144ski. After the building had been closed, it was doused, probably with kerosene from the former Soviet warehouse.\" The exact number of victims could not be determined. The previously estimated figure of 1,600 \"seems highly unlikely, and was not confirmed in the course of the investigation\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}}\n\nThe report conclued that the perpetrators of the crime ''sensu stricto'' (\"in the strict sense\") were about 40 male \"Polish inhabitants of Jedwabne and its environs\". Responsibility for the crime ''sensu largo'' (\"in the broad sense\") could be ascribed to the Germans because of the presence of German military policemen at the Jedwabne police station. Their presence, \"though passive, was tantamount to consent to and tolerance of the crime against the Jewish inhabitants of the town\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}}<ref>Hooper, John (10 July 2002). \"No trial for Poles who killed Jews in 1941\".

IPN could neither conclusively prove nor disprove these accounts. \"Witness testimonies vary considerably\" on the question of whether the Germans took the Jews to the barn or were present there.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} The IPN found that the \"Polish population\" had played a \"decisive role in the execution of the criminal plan\". The IPN wrote: \"On the basis of the evidence gathered in the investigation, it is not possible to determine the reasons for the passive behavior of the majority of the town's population in the face of the crime. In particular, it cannot be determined whether this passivity resulted from acceptance of the crime or from intimidation caused by the brutality of the perpetrators' acts.\"{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}}\n\nLeon Kieres delivered the IPN report to the Polish parliament.

The 18th century saw upheaval in Jalandhar amidst an anarchy caused by the disintegration of the Mughals and power struggles involving [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|Persians]], [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]] and [[Sikhs]]. It was captured by the [[Singhpuria Misl|Faizullahpuria Misl]] in 1766, and in 1811 [[Ranjit Singh]] incorporated it within the [[Sikh Empire]].<ref>Parminder Singh Grover Moga, Davinderjit Singh, Discover Punjab: Attractions of Punjab, Parminder Singh Grover, 20 May 2011</ref> \n\nIn 1849, following the annexation of the Punjab by the [[East India Company]], the city of Jalandhar, now spelt ''Jullundur'', became the headquarters of the Division and [[Jalandhar district|District]] of the same name. In the mid 19th century, British officials regarded Jalandhar as densely populated and farmed to capacity. This led to the district being a chief recruitment area for settlers to colonise the newly irrigated [[Punjab Canal Colonies]] in western Punjab.<ref>Tom G. Kessinger, University of California, Berkeley.
