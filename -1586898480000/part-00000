Even those spots which are disordered by art, Nature is ever at work to reclaim, and to make them look as if the foot of man had never known them. Only a small plot of ground is occupied with graves and the old mansion is in ruins.\n\nThe most conspicuous glory of Bonaventure is its noble avenue of live-oaks. They are the most magnificent planted trees I have ever seen, about fifty feet high and perhaps three or four feet in diameter, with broad spreading leafy heads. The main branches reach out horizontally until they come together over the driveway, embowering it throughout its entire length, while each branch is adorned like a garden with ferns, flowers, grasses, and dwarf palmettos.\n\nBut of all the plants of these curious tree-gardens the most striking and characteristic is the so-called Long Moss ([[Spanish moss|''Tillandsia usneoides'']]). It drapes all the branches from top to bottom, hanging in long silvery-gray skeins, reaching a length of not less than eight or ten feet, and when slowly waving in the wind they produce a solemn funereal effect singularly impressive.\n\nThere are also thousands of smaller trees and clustered bushes, covered almost from sight in the glorious brightness of their own light. The place is half surrounded by the salt marshes and islands of the river, their reeds and sedges making a delightful fringe. Many bald eagles roost among the trees along the side of the marsh. Their screams are heard every morning, joined with the noise of crows and the songs of countless warblers, hidden deep in their dwellings of leafy bowers. Large flocks of butterflies, flies, all kinds of happy insects, seem to be in a perfect fever of joy and sportive gladness. The whole place seems like a center of life. The dead do not reign there alone.\n\nBonaventure to me is one of the most impressive assemblages of animal and plant creatures I ever met. I was fresh from the Western prairies, the garden-like openings of Wisconsin, the beech and maple and oak woods of Indiana and Kentucky, the dark mysterious Savannah cypress forests; but never since I was allowed to walk the woods have I found so impressive a company of trees as the [[Tillandsia|tillandsia-draped]] oaks of Bonaventure.\n\nI gazed awe-stricken as one new-arrived from another world.

He began his career in journalism when he was employed as a reporter for ''The Torquay Directory and South Devon Journal'', later working for the ''[[Western Morning News]]''. In 1863, he obtained a position with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in [[London]], beginning an association with the paper that would last for sixty years.<ref name=\"firth\">J. B. Firth, ''rev''.

(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 33, p. 414.</ref>\n\nLe Sage worked primarily as a foreign correspondent. Though not regarded as a great writer, he was best known for providing the first reports of the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|German troops marching into Paris]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. He was also present during the period of the [[Paris Commune]], as well as the coronation of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]]. He enjoyed a good relationship with first [[Joseph Moses Levy]] and then his son [[Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham|Edward Levy-Lawson]], successive owners of the ''Daily Telegraph''. When the senior Levy died, Le Sage was named as editor, though Levy-Lawson exercised firm control over the newspaper until he became Baron Burnham in 1903. As editor, Le Sage continued the traditions laid out by his predecessors, focusing on the middle class reader and ignoring criticism of his practices.<ref name=\"firth\" />\n\nThough Le Sage proved a successful editor, by the early 20th century he was having difficulties keeping up with changes in the journalistic profession.

He began his career in journalism when he was employed as a reporter for ''The Torquay Directory and South Devon Journal'', later working for the ''[[Western Morning News]]''. In 1863, he obtained a position with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in [[London]], beginning an association with the paper that would last for sixty years.<ref name=\"firth\">J. B. Firth, ''rev''.

(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 33, p. 414.</ref>\n\nLe Sage worked primarily as a foreign correspondent. Though not regarded as a great writer, he was best known for providing the first reports of the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|German troops marching into Paris]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871. He was also present during the period of the [[Paris Commune]], as well as the coronation of [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]]. He enjoyed a good relationship with first [[Joseph Moses Levy]] and then his son [[Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baron Burnham|Edward Levy-Lawson]], successive owners of the ''Daily Telegraph''. When the senior Levy died, Le Sage was named as editor, though Levy-Lawson exercised firm control over the newspaper until he became Baron Burnham in 1903. As editor, Le Sage continued the traditions laid out by his predecessors, focusing on the middle class reader and ignoring criticism of his practices.<ref name=\"firth\" />\n\nThough Le Sage proved a successful editor, by the early 20th century he was having difficulties keeping up with changes in the journalistic profession. Hampered by his age and an unwillingness to delegate responsibility, he nonetheless continued on as editor and was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]] in 1918 in recognition for his services to journalism.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]]. China has been characterized as a [[potential superpower]], mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Names{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}==\n{{Main|Names of China}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|collapse=no\n|title=China\n|pic=China (Chinese characters).svg\n|piccap=\"China\" in [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] (top) and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional]] (bottom) Chinese characters\n|picupright=0.45\n| t={{linktext|\u4e2d\u570b}}\n| s={{linktext|\u4e2d\u56fd}}\n| p=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3\n| w=Chung\u00b9-kuo\u00b2\n| mi={{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|g|wo|2}}\n| sic=Zong<sup>1</sup> gwe<sup>2</sup>\n| bpmf=\u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310d\u3128\u311b\u02ca\n| xej=\ufe9f\u0652\ufeee\ufed7\u064f\ufeee\u064e\u0639\n| tp=Jhonggu\u00f3\n| mps=J\u016bnggu\u00f3\n| gr=Jonggwo\n| myr=J\u016bnggw\u00f3\n| zh-dungan=\u0496\u0443\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0439\n| poj=Tiong-kok\n| tl=Tiong-kok\n| gan=Tung-koe\u030dt\n| hsn=Tan<sup>33</sup>-kw\u025b<sup>24</sup>/\n| wuu=Tson<sup>\u5e73</sup>-koh<sup>\u5165</sup>\n| j=Zung1gwok3\n| y=J\u00f9nggwok ''or'' J\u016bnggwok\n| ci={{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|gw|ok|3}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|gw|ok|3}}\n| h=Dung<sup>24</sup>-gued<sup>2</sup>\n| phfs=Ch\u00fbng-koet\n| buc=D\u1e73\u0306ng-gu\u00f3k\n| hhbuc=De\u0324ng-go\u0324h\n| mblmc=D\u00f4\u0324ng-g\u014f\n|tib = {{bo-textonly|\u0f40\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b}}\n|zwpy= Krung-go\n|mong = [[File:China in Mongolian.svg|35px|alt=Dumdadu ulus]]\n|monr =Dumdadu ulus\n|mnc = [[File:China in Manchu.svg|35px|alt=Dulimbai Gurun]]\n|mnc_rom =Dulimbai Gurun\n|uig = {{lang|ug|\u062c\u06c7\u06ad\u06af\u0648}}\n|uly= Junggo\n|zha= Cungguek \n| altname = Alternate name\n| t2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef}}\n| s2 = {{linktext|\u4e2d\u534e}}\n| p2 = Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1\n| gan2 = tung<sup>1</sup> fa<sup>4</sup> ''or''<br />Chungfa\n| w2 = Chung\u00b9-hua\u00b2\n| bpmf2 = \u3113\u3128\u3125&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u310f\u3128\u311a\u02ca|tp2 = Jhonghu\u00e1 |mps2 = J\u016bnghu\u00e1 |gr2 = Jonghwa |myr2 = J\u016bnghw\u00e1 |mi2 = {{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|.|h|wa|2}}\n| xej2 = \ufe9f\u0652\ufeee \ufea7\u064f\ufeee\u064e \n| poj2 = Tiong-h\u00f4a\n| tl2 = Tiong-hu\u00e2\n| wuu2 = tson<sup>\u5e73</sup> gho<sup>\u5e73</sup>\n| j2 = Zung1waa4\n| ci2 = {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|7|.|w|aa|4}} ''or'' {{IPAc-yue|z|ung|1|.|w|aa|4}}\n| y2 = J\u00f9ng'w\u00e0h ''or'' J\u016bng'w\u00e0h\n| h2 = dung<sup>24</sup> fa<sup>11</sup>\n| phfs2 = Ch\u00fbng-f\u00e0\n| buc2 = D\u1e73\u0306ng-hu\u00e0\n| showflag=p\n| order=st\n| l={{nowrap|\"Middle\" or \"Central State\"<ref name=zg>{{citation |contribution=Reconstructing China beyond Homogeneity |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 105] |series=Political Theories in East Asian Context |title=Patriotism in East Asia |editor=Jun-Hyeok Kwak |editor2=Koichiro Matsuda |display-editors=0 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |date=2015 |last=Bilik |first=Naran }}</ref>}}}}\n \nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century.

Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods.

Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.<ref>Cecil, pp.42\u20133</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Rosenberg founded the [[Militant League for German Culture]].

These would be:\n\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' ([[Baltic countries]] and [[Belarus]]),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' ([[Ukraine]] and nearest territories),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' ([[Caucasus]] area),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Moskau]]'' (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas)\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Alfred Rosenberg in 1939]]\n[[File:Alfred Rosenberg's office from 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Former Nazi Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin (2014)]]\n\nAlthough Rosenberg regarded all the Soviet peoples as subhumans for their communist beliefs,<ref>[[David Irving|Irving, David]] (1996) ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'', London: Focal Point. p. 769.  {{ISBN|1872197132}}</ref> such suggestions were intended to encourage certain non-[[Russia]]n nationalism and to promote German interests for the benefit of future [[Aryan race|Aryan]] generations, in accord with geopolitical \"[[Lebensraum]] im Osten\" plans. They would provide a buffer against Soviet expansion in preparation for the total eradication of Communism and [[Bolshevism]] by decisive pre-emptive military action.\n\nFollowing these plans, when [[Wehrmacht]] forces invaded Soviet-controlled territory, they immediately implemented the first of the proposed Reichskommissariats of [[Ostland]] and [[Ukraine]], under the leadership of [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]], respectively. The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation. As Nazi Germany's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg considered Slavs, though lesser than Germans, to be Aryan. Rosenberg often complained to Hitler and Himmler about the treatment of non-Jewish occupied peoples.<ref name = \"kev\">Kevin P.

German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were somewhat able to win him over.<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/rvol.html Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]</ref>\n\nAmongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming and restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as \"stupid\".<ref>Leonid Grenkevich, ''The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941\u20131945: A Critical Historiographical Analysis'', Routledge, New York, 1999, pp. 169\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThere were numerous German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') posters asking for assistance in the ''Bandenkrieg,'' the war against the [[Soviet partisans]], though, once again, German policy had the effect of adding to their problems. Posters for \"volunteer\" labour, with inscriptions such as \"Come work with us to shorten the war\", hid the appalling realities faced by [[OST-Arbeiter|Russian workers in Germany]]. Many people joined the partisans rather than risk being sent to an unknown fate in the west.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother of Rosenberg's initiatives, the \"Free Caucasus\" campaign, was rather more successful, attracting various nationalities into the so-called Eastern Legion (''[[Ostlegionen]]''), though in the end this made little difference in the outcome of the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\n==Trial and execution==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Alfred Jodl, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg\n| width1    = 187\n| caption1  = Rosenberg (right) at the Nuremberg trials, with [[Hans Frank]] (centre) and [[Alfred Jodl]]\n| image2    = Defendants Nuremberg-War-Crimes-Tribunal 1945-11-27.jpg\n| width2    = 255\n| caption2  = 1946 Nuremberg courtroom: Rosenberg (front row, left)\n}}\n[[File:Dead alfredrosenberg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rosenberg after his hanging]]\nRosenberg was captured by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops at the end of the war in [[Flensburg]]-[[M\u00fcrwik]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99007254 |title=Allies Capture Nazi Pagan Philosopher. |newspaper=[[The Northern Star|Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876\u20131954)]] |location=Lismore, NSW |date=22 May 1945 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He was tried at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and found guilty of all four counts: conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[wars of aggression]]; [[war crimes]]; and [[crimes against humanity]].

He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views, rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure \"Race\" whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by \"Providence\". In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a \"positive Christianity\".\n\nAfter Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]]. He placed himself in the position of being the man to save Positive Christianity from utter destruction at the hands of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|atheistic antitheist Communist]]s of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9SBndd4Jc0QC|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|author=Kershaw, Ian|year= 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|page= 109|isbn= 0-19-280206-2|oclc = 47063365\n|quote = Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations.

Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.<ref>Cecil, pp.42\u20133</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Rosenberg founded the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. He later formed the \"[[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question|Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question]],\" dedicated to identifying and attacking Jewish influence in German culture and to recording the history of Judaism from a radical nationalist perspective. He became a [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Deputy in 1930 and published his book on [[Master race|racial theory]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (''Der Mythus des 20.

Rosenberg built on the works of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], [[Madison Grant]], the [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]] as well as on the beliefs of Hitler. Rosenberg placed Blacks and Jews at the very bottom of the ladder, while at the very top stood the white \"[[Aryan]]\" race. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]] which regarded Nordics as the \"[[master race]]\",<ref group=notes>Rosenberg wrote: \"No people of Europe is racially homogeneous, also Germany is not. According to the latest research, we accept five races all of which reveal perceptibly different types.

The ERR were especially active in Paris in looting art stolen from famous Jewish families such as the [[Rothschilds]] and that of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].

[[Alfred Meyer]] served as his deputy and represented him at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. Another official of the Ministry, [[Georg Leibbrandt]], also attended the conference, at Rosenberg's request.\n\nRosenberg had presented Hitler with his plan for the organization of the conquered Eastern territories, suggesting the establishment of new administrative districts, to replace the previously [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories with new [[Reichskommissar]]iats. These would be:\n\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' ([[Baltic countries]] and [[Belarus]]),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' ([[Ukraine]] and nearest territories),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' ([[Caucasus]] area),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Moskau]]'' (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas)\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Alfred Rosenberg in 1939]]\n[[File:Alfred Rosenberg's office from 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Former Nazi Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin (2014)]]\n\nAlthough Rosenberg regarded all the Soviet peoples as subhumans for their communist beliefs,<ref>[[David Irving|Irving, David]] (1996) ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'', London: Focal Point. p. 769.  {{ISBN|1872197132}}</ref> such suggestions were intended to encourage certain non-[[Russia]]n nationalism and to promote German interests for the benefit of future [[Aryan race|Aryan]] generations, in accord with geopolitical \"[[Lebensraum]] im Osten\" plans. They would provide a buffer against Soviet expansion in preparation for the total eradication of Communism and [[Bolshevism]] by decisive pre-emptive military action.\n\nFollowing these plans, when [[Wehrmacht]] forces invaded Soviet-controlled territory, they immediately implemented the first of the proposed Reichskommissariats of [[Ostland]] and [[Ukraine]], under the leadership of [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]], respectively. The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation. As Nazi Germany's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg considered Slavs, though lesser than Germans, to be Aryan. Rosenberg often complained to Hitler and Himmler about the treatment of non-Jewish occupied peoples.<ref name = \"kev\">Kevin P.

German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were somewhat able to win him over.<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/rvol.html Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]</ref>\n\nAmongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming and restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as \"stupid\".<ref>Leonid Grenkevich, ''The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941\u20131945: A Critical Historiographical Analysis'', Routledge, New York, 1999, pp. 169\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThere were numerous German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') posters asking for assistance in the ''Bandenkrieg,'' the war against the [[Soviet partisans]], though, once again, German policy had the effect of adding to their problems. Posters for \"volunteer\" labour, with inscriptions like \"Come work with us to shorten the war\", hid the appalling realities faced by [[OST-Arbeiter|Russian workers in Germany]]. Many people joined the partisans rather than risk being sent to an unknown fate in the west.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother of Rosenberg's initiatives, the \"Free Caucasus\" campaign, was rather more successful, attracting various nationalities into the so-called Eastern Legion (''[[Ostlegionen]]''), though in the end this made little difference in the outcome of the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\n==Trial and execution==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Alfred Jodl, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg\n| width1    = 187\n| caption1  = Rosenberg (right) at the Nuremberg trials, with [[Hans Frank]] (centre) and [[Alfred Jodl]]\n| image2    = Defendants Nuremberg-War-Crimes-Tribunal 1945-11-27.jpg\n| width2    = 255\n| caption2  = 1946 Nuremberg courtroom: Rosenberg (front row, left)\n}}\n[[File:Dead alfredrosenberg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rosenberg after his hanging]]\nRosenberg was captured by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops at the end of the war in [[Flensburg]]-[[M\u00fcrwik]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99007254 |title=Allies Capture Nazi Pagan Philosopher. |newspaper=[[The Northern Star|Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876\u20131954)]] |location=Lismore, NSW |date=22 May 1945 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He was tried at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and found guilty of all four counts: conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[wars of aggression]]; [[war crimes]]; and [[crimes against humanity]].

He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views, rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure \"Race\" whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by \"Providence\". In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a \"positive Christianity\".\n\nAfter Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]].
