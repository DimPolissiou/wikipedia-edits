He headed the Yeshiva in Berlin, and published research on the Pentateuch and Mishna, both in reaction to erstwhile  Biblical criticism.\n\n==Education and career==\nBorn in [[Verb\u00f3]] in 1843, he attended various [[Yeshiva]]s in his native town before he entered the college at [[Bratislava|Pressburg]], from which he graduated in 1865. He then studied [[philosophy]], history, and Oriental languages at [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]], taking his doctor's degree in 1871<ref name=je/> from the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. His rabbinical training was at the hands of [[Moshe Schick]] and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].\n\nShortly after obtaining his degree, he became employed as a teacher in [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]'s ''Realschule'' school in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and in 1873 moved to Berlin to join the faculty of the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary|Rabbinical Seminary of Berlin]] where he eventually became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] ([[Rosh Yeshiva]]) in 1899 after the death of [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref name=je>{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Hoffmann, David|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7804-hoffmann-david|accessdate=Jan 30, 2017|first1=Isidore|last1=Singer|authorlink1=Isidore Singer}}</ref>\n\nHis commentary on the Pentateuch is still often referenced; he is referred to as \u05e8\u05d3\"\u05e6 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e4\u05de\u05df in later Rabbinic writing.\n\n==A selective ''Wissenschaft'' practitioner==\nDavid Hoffmann is in some ways the prototype of the contemporary [[Orthodox Jewish]] scholar, facing the ubiquitous tension between faithfulness to tradition and the demands of critical inquiry. Though born in [[Hungary]], he adapted the [[Jews of Germany|German-Jewish]] approach of openness towards general culture, world and society. \n\nHe employed the critical scientific method to the [[Talmud]] and wrote about the history of the development of the form of the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]] (as opposed to the development of the [[halachah|Law]] itself, the latter being an enterprise antithetical to traditional Jewish beliefs; see below). Despite his worldly inclinations, he was an original member of the more traditionally oriented ''[[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]]'' (council of great Torah sages), and was also known to be a person of great moral conduct and piety.\n\nHoffman was the leading authority on traditional ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) in [[Germany]] in his lifetime, as well as an expert in the area of ''[[midrash halakha]]'' (legalistic [[Biblical exegesis]]). He was also known for his efforts to disprove the [[Documentary Hypothesis]], as expressed by the [[Julius Wellhausen|Graf-Wellhausen]] theory, with his arguments presented in the work ''Die wichtigsten Instanzen gegen die Graf-Wellhausensche Hypothese'' (1903/1916).  [[A. Altmann]], however, sees Hoffmann's writings on these matters (though evidencing great expertise) as pure apologetics, the cause of which may be seen as laid out in his introduction to [[Leviticus]] {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}, where Hoffmann makes the following remarks:\n\n{{quotation|I willingly agree that, in consequence of the foundation of my belief, I am unable to arrive at the conclusion that the [[Pentateuch]] was written by anyone other than [[Moses]]... \nWe believe that the whole [[Jewish Bible|Bible]] is true, holy, and of divine origin. That every word of the [[Torah]] was inscribed by divine command is expressed in the principle ''Torah min Ha Shamayim''... We must not presume to set ourselves up as critics of the author of a biblical text or doubt the truth of his statements or question the correctness of his teaching...\nThe Jewish commentator must (therefore) constantly be on guard against interpreting the passage in such a way as to appear to be in conflict with traditional [[Halachah]]. Just as the Torah as a divine revelation must not contradict itself, in the same way it must not contradict the Oral Law which is of divine origin.}}\n  \nYet, despite the piety of the above sentiments, and his repeated proclamations regarding the divinity of the Oral Law, Hoffmann was still very much the ''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums|Wissenschaft]]'' scholar. He cites in his work scholars such as [[Z. Frankel]], [[A. Geiger]], [[S.J. Rapoport]], and [[H. Graetz]], he studies the influences of [[Ancient Near Eastern]] culture on the evolution of the Talmud, and he identifies problems in the transmitted text. For example, Hoffmann in ''The First Mishna'' (discussed [[#Writings|below]]) sees the present Mishna [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]] as having been redacted from three different sources, a Mishna of [[Rabbi Akiva]], a Mishna of [[Rabbi Meir]], and a Mishna of [[Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi]], the originals of which cannot be completely reconstructed due to their thoroughgoing fusion and subsequent manipulation.\n\nThe extent to which Hoffmann resided in the ''Wissenschaft'' movement can also be seen from the criticism he received from such opponents of the movement as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hildesheimer notes regarding Hirsch's opinion of his Rabbinical Seminary (where Hoffmann worked<ref name=je/> after leaving Hirsch's institution) that \"a question certainly exists as to whether Rabbi Hirsch considers the seminary to be an Orthodox institution.\" Hirsch's opposition extended to Hoffmann's own work, judging Hoffmann's book ''Mar Samuel'' to contain heresies {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}.\n\nHoffmann's resolution of this tension between faithfulness to tradition and textual criticism is found by {{Harvtxt|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}} in the following passage from the introduction to ''The First Mishna'':\n\n{{quotation|Thus, in the study of the [[Tanakh|Holy Scriptures]] on the one hand, we consider the authenticity and integrity to be absolute, and we can recognize as true only such results as do not question that premise.

{"title_page": "Carnival Road March", "text_new": "The '''Carnival Road March''' is the musical composition played most often at the \"judging points\" along the parade route during a [[Caribbean Carnival]]. Originating as part of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], the term has been applied to other Caribbean carnivals. There it was and is still viewed as a musical genre.\n\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]] the Road March title has been officially given out every year since 1932 (with the exception of the years affected by [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] when Carnival did not officially take place). Popular Unofficial Road Marches have also been recognized in T&T from since 1834 after slavery was abolished. Prior to World War II, T&T Road Marches were referred to as \"Leggos\" or \"Breakaways\" by the general population but were rebranded by the Carnival authorities as the Road March from 1946. Scoring is based upon a register-and-count system devised by a Carnival committee before the start of the parade. \n\nAfter a [[Germany|German]] pop song \"[[The Happy Wanderer|Happy Wanderer]]\" by the Obernkirchen Children's Choir won the Trinidad & Tobago Road March title in 1955 the rules were amended to restrict songs eligible to be in the road march competition to only songs vocalised by local Trinidad & Tobago artistes. The Road March title is among the most prestigious in Trinidad Carnival. The most such titles have gone to the late [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]] with eleven wins, ahead of [[Superblue|Super Blue]] with ten wins, [[Machel Montano]] also with ten wins and the [[Mighty Sparrow]] with eight wins. In the mid-1970s, a woman officially broke through in the male dominated Calypso arena. [[Calypso Rose]] was the first female to officially win the Trinidad and Tobago Road March competition in 1977 with her song \"Give More Tempo\". The following year 1978 with \"Come Leh We Jam\" in addition to winning the Road March title again, Calypso Rose also won the \"Calypso King\" competition, the first time a woman had received that award. As a result, the \"Calypso King\" competition was officially renamed the \"[[Calypso Monarch]]\" competition to take into account that females also take part and have won titles.\n\nFirst Calypso recordings were made in 1912<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Loveys-Original-Trinidad-String-Band-Calypso-Dawn-1912/release/4554456|title=Lovey's Original Trinidad String Band* - Calypso Dawn: 1912|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref> so Trinidad & Tobago Road Marches prior to 1912 were not recorded that year but may have been recorded years later after recording technology became available to Calypso pioneers of the 1910s to 1930s. In 2019 [[Skinny Fabulous]] of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent & the Grenadines]] created history by becoming the second foreign artiste (after the German Obernkirchen Children's Choir) and the very first foreign soca artiste to win the prestigious Trinidad & Tobago Road March title with a song called \"Famalay\" which was vocalised by [[Skinny Fabulous]], [[Machel Montano]] and [[Bunji Garlin|Bunji Garllin]].\n\n==Trinidad and Tobago==\nBelow are over 100 T&T Road Marches starting from this year going back to the 1800s when most calypsos were sung in Patios.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Song\n!Album / Notes\n|-\n|2020\n| Neil \u201cIwer\u201d George & Kees Dieffenthaller\n|\u201cStage Gone Bad\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''2nd & 1st T&T RM wins''\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Skinny Fabulous]], [[Machel Montano]] & [[Bunji Garlin]] \n|\"Famalay\"\n|''G.O.A.T / 1st, 10th & 1st T&T RM wins''\n|-\n| 2018 \n| [[Machel Montano]] & [[Superblue]]\n| \"Soca Kingdom\" \n| ''9th & 10th T&T RM wins''\n|-\n|2017\n|Ultimate Rejects featuring [[Maximus Dan|MX Prime]]\n|\"Full Extreme\" (''also won [[Panorama (music competition)|Panorama]]'')\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Machel Montano\n|\"Waiting On the Stage\"\n|''Monk Evolution''\n|-\n|2015\n|Machel Montano\n|\"Like Ah Boss\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''Monk Monte''\n|-\n| 2014\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Ministry Of Road\" (MOR) ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n| ''Happiest Man Alive''\n|-\n| 2013\n|[[Superblue]]\n| \"Fantastic Friday\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''Soca Gold 2013''\n|-\n| 2012\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Pump Yuh Flag\" (PYF) ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n| ''Double M''\n|- \n| 2011\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Advantage\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n| ''The Return''\n|-\n| 2010\n| JW & Blaze\n| \"Palance\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''Monkey Steak Play Soca''\n|-\n| 2009\n| [[Fay-Ann Lyons]]\n| \"Meet Super Blue\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| Fay-Ann Lyons\n| \"Get On\"\n|''Best Of Best Soca 2008''\n|-\n| 2007\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Jumbie\"\n| ''[[Book of Angels (Machel Montano album)|Book of Angels]]''\n|-\n| 2006\n|[[Machel Montano]] & [[Patrice Roberts]]\n| \"Band Of De Year\" (BODY)\n| ''[[B.O.D.Y.

founded to celebrate the anniversary of the independence of Grenada, Carriacou, and Petit Martinique, which gained their independence on 7 February 1974. In 1978 Grenada Carnival was moved to the month of May by the Eric Gairy led government but after that government was overthrown in March 1979, the 1979 Carnival celebration was cancelled. In 1980 the new People\u2019s Revolutionary Government (PRG) led by Maurice Bishop brought back Grenada Carnival, which was held in May that year. After a feasibility study Grenada Carnival was moved to August the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spicemas Grenada|url=http://www.spicemasgrenada.com/press/2009/05/spicemas_25.html|publisher=Grenada Carnival Committee|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> Hence annually from 1981 Grenada's Carnival has been held in August culminating with their Road March competition.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Song\n!Album / Notes\n|-\n|2019\n|Runi J\n|\"Diagnosis\"\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Lil Natty & Thunda\n|\"Get In Your Section\"\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Lil Natty & Thunda\n|\"Top Striker\"\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2016\n|Lil Natty & Thunda\n|\"Take It To Dem\"\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2015\n|Synnah\n|\"Jab on Sesame Street\"\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2014\n|Squeeze Head\n|\"Turbo Charge\"\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Boyzie\n|\"Mas Everywhere\"\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Boyzie\n|\"Born Troublesome\"\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Lavaman\n|\"So We Dey\"\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Otis\n|\"Tornado\"\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Mr. Killa\n|\"Swing It Away\"\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Miney\n|\"10,000 Masqueraders\"\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|Berbice\n|\"Traffic\"\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Soca Banton\n|\"Over You Head\"\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Boogie B\n|\"Clear The Smoke\"\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|General PP\n|\"Never Say Never\"\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|Super P\n|\"Do What You Want\"\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|Japs\n|\"Helicopter\"\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|[[Tallpree]]\n|\"Rags Invasion\"\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|Tallpree\n|\"Grave, Jail, Hospital\"\n|\n|-\n|1999\n|Sheldon Douglas\n|\"Find Something\"\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Sheldon Douglas\n|\"Stamp Up\"\n|\n|-\n|1997 \n|Tangler\n|\"Chala Baiti\"\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|Tangler\n|\"Bouncing Low\"\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Inspector\n|\"Madness\"\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|Inspector\n|\"Sweeter Than Home\"\n|\n|-\n|1993\n|Flying Cloud\n|\"Way You Man\"\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|Flying Cloud\n|\"Raise You Hand\"\n|\n|-\n|1991\n|Moss International\n|\"Jambalesse Rule\"\n|\n|-\n|1990\n|Ajamu\n|\"Open Up\"\n|\n|-\n|1989\n|Skylark\n|\"Simple Policeman\"\n|\n|-\n|1988\n|Black Wizard\n|\"Soca Feeling\"\n|\n|-\n|1987\n|Squeezy\n|\"To Cork Ah Hole\"\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|Inspector\n|\"No Kicks\"\n|\n|-\n|1985\n|Inspector\n|\"Dance\"\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|Flying Turkey\n|\"Byron\"\n|\n|-\n|1983\n|African Teller\n|\"You Cock Ain\u2019t Dey\"\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|Snakey Boy\n|\"Charmaine Darling\"\n|\n|-\n|1981\n|Timpo\n|\"We Want We Carnival\"\n|\n|}\n\n==St. Lucia==\nInvader has won the Road March in St. Lucia seven times.

Originating as part of the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], the term has been applied to other Caribbean carnivals. There it was and is still viewed as a musical genre.\n\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]] the Road March title has been officially given out every year since 1932 (with the exception of the years affected by [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] when Carnival did not officially take place). Popular Unofficial Road Marches have also been recognized in T&T from since 1834 after slavery was abolished. Prior to World War II, T&T Road Marches were referred to as \"Leggos\" or \"Breakaways\" by the general population but were rebranded by the Carnival authorities as the Road March from 1946. Scoring is based upon a register-and-count system devised by a Carnival committee before the start of the parade. \n\nAfter a [[Germany|German]] pop song \"[[The Happy Wanderer|Happy Wanderer]]\" by the Obernkirchen Children's Choir won the Trinidad & Tobago Road March title in 1955 the rules were amended to restrict songs eligible to be in the road march competition to only songs vocalised by local Trinidad & Tobago artistes. The Road March title is among the most prestigious in Trinidad Carnival. The most such titles have gone to the late [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]] with eleven wins, ahead of [[Superblue|Super Blue]] with ten wins, [[Machel Montano]] also with ten wins and the [[Mighty Sparrow]] with eight wins. In the mid-1970s, a woman officially broke through in the male dominated Calypso arena. [[Calypso Rose]] was the first female to officially win the Trinidad and Tobago Road March competition in 1977 with her song \"Give More Tempo\". The following year 1978 with \"Come Leh We Jam\" in addition to winning the Road March title again, Calypso Rose also won the \"Calypso King\" competition, the first time a woman had received that award. As a result, the \"Calypso King\" competition was officially renamed the \"[[Calypso Monarch]]\" competition to take into account that females also take part and have won titles.\n\nFirst Calypso recordings were made in 1912<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Loveys-Original-Trinidad-String-Band-Calypso-Dawn-1912/release/4554456|title=Lovey's Original Trinidad String Band* - Calypso Dawn: 1912|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref> so Trinidad & Tobago Road Marches prior to 1912 were not recorded that year but may have been recorded years later after recording technology became available to Calypso pioneers of the 1910s to 1930s. In 2019 [[Skinny Fabulous]] of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent & the Grenadines]] created history by becoming the second foreign artiste (after the German Obernkirchen Children's Choir) and the very first foreign soca artiste to win the prestigious Trinidad & Tobago Road March title with a song called \"Famalay\" which was vocalised by [[Skinny Fabulous]], [[Machel Montano]] and [[Bunji Garlin|Bunji Garllin]].\n\n==Trinidad and Tobago==\nBelow are over 100 T&T Road Marches starting from this year going back to the 1800s when most calypsos were sung in Patios.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Song\n!Album / Notes\n|-\n|2020\n| Neil \u201cIwer\u201d George & Kees Dieffenthaller\n|\u201cStage Gone Bad\" (also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])\n|''2nd & 1st T&T RM wins''\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Skinny Fabulous]], [[Machel Montano]] & [[Bunji Garlin]] \n|\"Famalay\"\n|''G.O.A.T / 1st, 10th & 1st T&T RM wins''\n|-\n| 2018 \n| [[Machel Montano]] & [[Superblue]]\n| \"Soca Kingdom\" \n| ''9th & 10th T&T RM wins''\n|-\n|2017\n|Ultimate Rejects featuring [[Maximus Dan|MX Prime]]\n|\"Full Extreme\" (''also won [[Panorama (music competition)|Panorama]]'')\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Machel Montano\n|\"Waiting On the Stage\"\n|''Monk Evolution''\n|-\n|2015\n|Machel Montano\n|\"Like Ah Boss\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''Monk Monte''\n|-\n| 2014\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Ministry Of Road\" (MOR) ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n| ''Happiest Man Alive''\n|-\n| 2013\n|[[Superblue]]\n| \"Fantastic Friday\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''Soca Gold 2013''\n|-\n| 2012\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Pump Yuh Flag\" (PYF) ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n| ''Double M''\n|- \n| 2011\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Advantage\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n| ''The Return''\n|-\n| 2010\n| JW & Blaze\n| \"Palance\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|''Monkey Steak Play Soca''\n|-\n| 2009\n| [[Fay-Ann Lyons]]\n| \"Meet Super Blue\" ''(also won [[International Soca Monarch|ISM]])''\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| Fay-Ann Lyons\n| \"Get On\"\n|''Best Of Best Soca 2008''\n|-\n| 2007\n| Machel Montano\n| \"Jumbie\"\n| ''[[Book of Angels (Machel Montano album)|Book of Angels]]''\n|-\n| 2006\n|[[Machel Montano]] & [[Patrice Roberts]]\n| \"Band Of De Year\" (BODY)\n| ''[[B.O.D.Y.

founded to celebrate the anniversary of the independence of Grenada, Carriacou, and Petit Martinique, which gained their independence on 7 February 1974. In 1978 Grenada Carnival was moved to the month of May by the Eric Gairy led government but after that government was overthrown in March 1979, the 1979 Carnival celebration was cancelled. In 1980 the new People\u2019s Revolutionary Government (PRG) led by Maurice Bishop brought back Grenada Carnival, which was held in May that year. After a feasibility study Grenada Carnival was moved to August the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spicemas Grenada|url=http://www.spicemasgrenada.com/press/2009/05/spicemas_25.html|publisher=Grenada Carnival Committee|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> Hence annually from 1981 Grenada's Carnival has been held in August culminating with their Road March competition.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Performer\n!Song\n!Album / Notes\n|-\n|2019\n|Runi J\n|\"Diagnosis\"\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Lil Natty & Thunda\n|\"Get In Your Section\"\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Lil Natty & Thunda\n|\"Top Striker\"\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2016\n|Lil Natty & Thunda\n|\"Take It To Dem\"\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2015\n|Synnah\n|\"Jab on Sesame Street\"\n|\n|-\n|-\n|2014\n|Squeeze Head\n|\"Turbo Charge\"\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Boyzie\n|\"Mas Everywhere\"\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Boyzie\n|\"Born Troublesome\"\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Lavaman\n|\"So We Dey\"\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Otis\n|\"Tornado\"\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Mr. Killa\n|\"Swing It Away\"\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Miney\n|\"10,000 Masqueraders\"\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|Berbice\n|\"Traffic\"\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Soca Banton\n|\"Over You Head\"\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Boogie B\n|\"Clear The Smoke\"\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|General PP\n|\"Never Say Never\"\n|\n|-\n|2003\n|Super P\n|\"Do What You Want\"\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|Japs\n|\"Helicopter\"\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|[[Tallpree]]\n|\"Rags Invasion\"\n|\n|-\n|2000\n|Tallpree\n|\"Grave, Jail, Hospital\"\n|\n|-\n|1999\n|Sheldon Douglas\n|\"Find Something\"\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Sheldon Douglas\n|\"Stamp Up\"\n|\n|-\n|1997 \n|Tangler\n|\"Chala Baiti\"\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|Tangler\n|\"Bouncing Low\"\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Inspector\n|\"Madness\"\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|Inspector\n|\"Sweeter Than Home\"\n|\n|-\n|1993\n|Flying Cloud\n|\"Way You Man\"\n|\n|-\n|1992\n|Flying Cloud\n|\"Raise You Hand\"\n|\n|-\n|1991\n|Moss International\n|\"Jambalesse Rule\"\n|\n|-\n|1990\n|Ajamu\n|\"Open Up\"\n|\n|-\n|1989\n|Skylark\n|\"Simple Policeman\"\n|\n|-\n|1988\n|Black Wizard\n|\"Soca Feeling\"\n|\n|-\n|1987\n|Squeezy\n|\"To Cork Ah Hole\"\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|Inspector\n|\"No Kicks\"\n|\n|-\n|1985\n|Inspector\n|\"Dance\"\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|Flying Turkey\n|\"Byron\"\n|\n|-\n|1983\n|African Teller\n|\"You Cock Ain\u2019t Dey\"\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|Snakey Boy\n|\"Charmaine Darling\"\n|\n|-\n|1981\n|Timpo\n|\"We Want We Carnival\"\n|\n|}\n\n==St. Lucia==\nInvader has won the Road March in St. Lucia seven times.

It shares the postcode [[London SW16]] with neighbouring districts [[Streatham]] and [[Croydon]]. Norbury is {{convert|6.7|mi|km|1}} south of [[Charing Cross]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2016}}\nThe name Norbury derives from ''North [[Burh]]'', (North Borough). Some local histories note that this was due to Norbury's position on the northern boundary of the former Manor of [[Croydon]]. Others state that it takes its name from a split in the borough of Bensham, one of the former seven boroughs of Croydon. \"Northbenchesham\" became the Northborough, then Norbury; \"Southbenchesham\" later became [[Thornton Heath]].\n\n==History==\nFor most of its history Norbury was rural countryside through which the [[London to Brighton Way]] Roman road passed. At Hepworth Road, the intact road, 32 feet wide, was excavated in 1961. Remnants of a metalled ford across the stream were found further south at Hermitage Bridge on the [[Norbury Brook|River Graveney]] which forms part of the boundary between Norbury and Streatham, before flowing on to the [[River Wandle]], then the [[River Thames]].<ref name=Margary>{{cite book|author=I. D. Margary|title=Roman Ways in the Weald|year=1965|publisher=Phoenix House}}</ref>\n\n===Norbury Manor===\nBy the early thirteenth century, Norbury was a sub-manor within the chief manor of Croydon. The first recorded mention of Norbury Manor was in 1229 when Peter de Bendings conveyed the Manor to John de Kemsing and his wife Idonea and is referred to as the \"lands stretching out either side of the London Road\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> In 1269 the Manor comprised 91 acres of arable land in [[Pollards Hill]], 30 acres in [[Thornton Heath|Grandon]], 55 acres of pasture, 36 acres of heathland, 2 acres of woodland and 17 acres of meadow land.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> In 1337, Norbury Manor was granted to Nicolas de Carew, who also held neighbouring [[Beddington|Beddington Manor]]. The Carew family remained Lords of the Manor of Norbury until 1859 except for a brief interlude during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. Norbury remained rural and agricultural throughout this period. By 1800 most of the land in Norbury was owned by a handful of people; approximately half was owned by the Carew family, and the remaining large landowners were Peter du Cane, Croydon Hospital and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]].<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> \n\n===Victorian period===\nAt the start of the Victorian period, the population consisted of fifty six people and three main dwellings; the Hermitage, Norbury Manor Farm House and Norbury Hall.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> The Hermitage was situated alongside Green Lane and backed onto Hermitage Sports Ground (now Norbury Park). The last resident of The Hermitage was [[Jenny Hill (music hall performer)|Jenny Hill]], a famous music hall performer in the 1890s.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> In 1894 the North Surrey Golf Club built a 90-acre golf club on Hermitage Sports Ground and in 1896 purchased The Hermitage to use as their club house. The following year it was destroyed by fire.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> Norbury Manor Farm House was situated on the corner where Norbury Avenue meets Kensington Avenue and was the Norbury Manor House until Norbury Hall was built in 1802.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> The Farm House was demolished in 1914. Only Norbury Hall remains, now used as a retirement home and protected as a [[Listed building|Grade II listed building]].<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1859, the first Victorian villa, known as Norbury Villa, was built on the London Road.  A second villa followed in 1878, and thereafter followed the construction of clusters of large villas along both sides of the London Road. In 1867, the Committee of Croydon Steeple Chase and Hurdle Races leased approximately 100 acres at Lonesome Farm.

It shares the postcode [[London SW16]] with neighbouring districts [[Streatham]] and [[Croydon]]. Norbury is {{convert|6.7|mi|km|1}} south of [[Charing Cross]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2016}}\nThe name Norbury derives from ''North [[Burh]]'', (North Borough). Some local histories note that this was due to Norbury's position on the northern boundary of the former Manor of [[Croydon]]. Others state that it takes its name from a split in the borough of Bensham, one of the former seven boroughs of Croydon. \"Northbenchesham\" became the Northborough, then Norbury; \"Southbenchesham\" later became [[Thornton Heath]].\n\n==History==\nFor most of its history Norbury was rural countryside through which the [[London to Brighton Way]] Roman road passed. At Hepworth Road, the intact road, 32 feet wide, was excavated in 1961. Remnants of a metalled ford across the stream were found further south at Hermitage Bridge on the [[Norbury Brook|River Graveney]] which forms part of the boundary between Norbury and Streatham, before flowing on to the [[River Wandle]], then the [[River Thames]].<ref name=Margary>{{cite book|author=I. D. Margary|title=Roman Ways in the Weald|year=1965|publisher=Phoenix House}}</ref>\n\n===Norbury Manor===\nBy the early thirteenth century, Norbury was a sub-manor within the chief manor of Croydon. The first recorded mention of Norbury Manor was in 1229 when Peter de Bendings conveyed the Manor to John de Kemsing and his wife Idonea and is referred to as the \"lands stretching out either side of the London Road\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> In 1269 the Manor comprised 91 acres of arable land in [[Pollards Hill]], 30 acres in [[Thornton Heath|Grandon]], 55 acres of pasture, 36 acres of heathland, 2 acres of woodland and 17 acres of meadow land.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> In 1337, Norbury Manor was granted to Nicolas de Carew, who also held neighbouring [[Beddington|Beddington Manor]]. The Carew family remained Lords of the Manor of Norbury until 1859 except for a brief interlude during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. Norbury remained rural and agricultural throughout this period. By 1800 most of the land in Norbury was owned by a handful of people; approximately half was owned by the Carew family, and the remaining large landowners were Peter du Cane, Croydon Hospital and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]].<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> \n\n===Victorian period===\nAt the start of the Victorian period, the population consisted of fifty six people and three main dwellings; the Hermitage, Norbury Manor Farm House and Norbury Hall.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> The Hermitage was situated alongside Green Lane and backed onto Hermitage Sports Ground (now Norbury Park). The last resident of The Hermitage was [[Jenny Hill (music hall performer)|Jenny Hill]], a famous music hall performer in the 1890s.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> In 1894 the North Surrey Golf Club built a 90 acre golf club on Hermitage Sports Ground and in 1896 purchased The Hermitage to use as their club house. The following year it was destroyed by fire.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> Norbury Manor Farm House was situated on the corner where Norbury Avenue meets Kensington Avenue and was the Norbury Manor House until Norbury Hall was built in 1802.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> The Farm House was demolished in 1914. Only Norbury Hall remains, now used as a retirement home and protected as a [[Listed building|Grade II listed building]].<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1859, the first Victorian villa, known as Norbury Villa, was built on the London Road.  A second villa followed in 1878, and thereafter followed the construction of clusters of large villas along both sides of the London Road. In 1867, the Committee of Croydon Steeple Chase and Hurdle Races leased approximately 100 acres at Lonesome Farm. The following year, the first Streatham Horse Race meeting was held and a temporary grandstand was built on Northborough Road. The two day meets, held four or five times a year, proved successful and attracted large crowds from London.<ref name=\"auto1\">Clark, David, A History of Norbury, The Streatham Society, 2013</ref> To cater for the crowds, [[Norbury railway station]] opened in 1878, built on a railway line which had run through Norbury since 1862.

From 1851 Southgate constituted a district chapelry under Edmonton which replaced a semi-private chapel at [[Arnos Grove]] built in the 17th century &mdash; immediately north-east of Betstyle.<ref name=origins/> The parent chapelry was upgraded with a church in 1863 and installed with stained glass windows in 1865 by [[D.G. Rossetti]] by which date it had many isolated streets of housing to serve such as around the crossroads at Betstyle (also written as Betstile).<ref name=origins>A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Eileen P Scarff and G C Tyack, 'Edmonton: Churches', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5 ed.

It was estimated the hamlet had 12 of 78 taxable houses in the narrow parish in 1795; but 33 inhabited houses in Colney Hatch are recorded in 1801. This co-parent parish extended a total of {{convert|3|mi}} west, [[Friern Barnet]].  Maps show the name Colney Hatch, interchangeably with New Southgate, coming to cover the more developed hamlet Betstyle, in the chapelry of [[Southgate, London|Southgate]] within the parish of [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]]; the refined hamlet and grand asylum outweighed  the initial stigma in official maps and deeds, but less so in social organisations and in the naming of the railway station, the line of which resembles the historic split between the two parishes and later districts including today's boroughs. The crossroads of Colney Hatch had Halliwick manor house standing north of some cottages on the south-west corner; The White House and The Orange Tree Inn on the north-west side near to Brook House; The Priory, north-east with Woodlands, Greenbank, and Springfield to the north to which were added the Hermitage and several cottages on the south-west corner by 1783.<ref name=friern/> It saw very little change in the 19th century before the construction of the county lunatic asylum: in 1882 Colney Hatch was described \"as a village which had sprung up to serve the staff\".<ref name=friern/>\n\nHowever Colney Hatch was from 1851 slowly erased from the names of schools, churches and most other organisations as residents sought to distance themselves from a lingering [[social stigma]] from passers-by and social gossip across the county of the large mental health institution. The vast site operated for many decades, first under an enforced mass segregation regime which was later abolished nationwide, to treat the mentally unwell &mdash; [[Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum]]. \n\nAll 19th century urban development was concentrated in the east on what had been Betstyle, {{convert|1|mi}} from the rural centre of the ancient, that is to say medieval-founded, elongated parish of [[Friern Barnet]] to the northwest. The name Colney Hatch Park was used by some developers for this area; however the new name New Southgate was increasingly adopted.\n\nParishes had taken over from [[manorial court]]s by devolution to their [[vestry|vestries]] chiefly in the 17th century. Southgate, extending to the north and east, became a [[local board]] in 1881, and later an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] and municipal borough. [[Friern Barnet]] civil parish, extending in the other directions, became [[Friern Barnet Urban District]] which existed between 1883 and 1965.<ref>http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10102704</ref> \n\n[[St Paul's Church, New Southgate]] was consecrated in 1873<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol5/pp181-187</ref>, taking part of its parish from [[Christ Church, Southgate]] and part from [[St James the Great, Friern Barnet]], the latter transferring land east of the [[Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol6/pp29-32</ref> The extant ecclesiastical parish boundary likewise traverses the boroughs of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] and [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] while additionally a small portion is within the [[London Borough of Haringey]], Bounds Green Ward.<ref>https://www.london.anglican.org/directory/st-paul-new-southgate/</ref>\n\n===Friern Hospital===\n{{main|Friern Hospital|Colney Hatch}}\nMany tens of acres were bought and used by the second county lunatic asylum for [[Middlesex]], as maps of before [[World War II]] show.

From 1851 Southgate constituted a district chapelry under Edmonton which replaced a semi-private chapel at [[Arnos Grove]] built in the 17th century &mdash; immediately north-east of Betstyle.<ref name=origins/> The parent chapelry was upgraded with a church in 1863 and installed with stained glass windows in 1865 by [[D.G. Rossetti]] by which date it had many isolated streets of housing to serve such as around the crossroads at Betstyle (also written as Betstile).<ref name=origins>A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Eileen P Scarff and G C Tyack, 'Edmonton: Churches', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5 ed.

T F T Baker and C R Elrington (London, 1980), pp. 6-15. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol6/pp6-15</ref> Development was tightly constrained.  It was estimated the hamlet had 12 of 78 taxable houses in the narrow parish in 1795; but 33 inhabited houses in Colney Hatch are recorded in 1801. This co-parent parish extended a total of {{convert|3|mi}} west, [[Friern Barnet]].  Maps show the name Colney Hatch, interchangeably with New Southgate, coming to cover the more developed hamlet Betstyle, in the chapelry of [[Southgate, London|Southgate]] within the parish of [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]]; the refined hamlet and grand asylum outweighed  the initial stigma in official maps and deeds, but less so in social organisations and in the naming of the railway station, the line of which resembles the historic split between the two parishes and later districts including today's boroughs. The crossroads of Colney Hatch had Halliwick manor house standing north of some cottages on the south-west corner; The White House and The Orange Tree Inn on the north-west side near to Brook House; The Priory, north-east with Woodlands, Greenbank, and Springfield to the north to which were added the Hermitage and several cottages on the south-west corner by 1783.<ref name=friern/> It saw very little change in the 19th century before the construction of the county lunatic asylum: in 1882 Colney Hatch was described \"as a village which had sprung up to serve the staff\".<ref name=friern/>\n\nHowever Colney Hatch was from 1851 slowly erased from the names of schools, churches and most other organisations as residents sought to distance themselves from a lingering [[social stigma]] from passers-by and social gossip across the county of the large mental health institution. The vast site operated for many decades, first under an enforced mass segregation regime which was later abolished nationwide, to treat the mentally unwell &mdash; [[Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum]]. \n\nAll 19th century urban development was concentrated in the east on what had been Betstyle, {{convert|1|mi}} from the rural centre of the ancient, that is to say medieval-founded, elongated parish of [[Friern Barnet]] to the northwest. The name Colney Hatch Park was used by some developers for this area; however the new name New Southgate was increasingly adopted.\n\nParishes had taken over from [[manorial court]]s by devolution to their [[vestry|vestries]] chiefly in the 17th century. Southgate, extending to the north and east, became a [[local board]] in 1881, and later an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] and municipal borough. [[Friern Barnet]] civil parish, extending in the other directions, became [[Friern Barnet Urban District]] which existed between 1883 and 1965.<ref>http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10102704</ref> \n\n[[St Paul's Church, New Southgate]] was consecrated in 1873<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol5/pp181-187</ref>, taking part of its parish from [[Christ Church, Southgate]] and part from [[St James the Great, Friern Barnet]], the latter transferring land east of the [[Great_Northern_Railway_(Great_Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].<ref>https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol6/pp29-32</ref> The extant ecclesiastical parish boundary likewise traverses the boroughs of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] and [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]] while additionally a small portion is within the [[London Borough of Haringey]], Bounds Green Ward.<ref>https://www.london.anglican.org/directory/st-paul-new-southgate/</ref>\n\n===Friern Hospital===\n{{main|Friern Hospital|Colney Hatch}}\nMany tens of acres were bought and used by the second county lunatic asylum for [[Middlesex]], as maps of before [[World War II]] show. The later mental health hospital on the site closed in 1993.

Villeneuve won the [[1995 PPG Indy Car World Series|1995]] [[Champ Car|CART]] Championship, the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995]] [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] [[Formula One]] World Championship, making him only the third driver after [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] to achieve such a feat. {{As of|2019}}, no other Canadian has won the Indianapolis 500 or the Formula One Drivers' title.\n\nFollowing two successful years in [[Champ Car|CART]], Villeneuve moved into [[Formula One]] with the front-running [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team, alongside [[Damon Hill]]. In his [[1996 Formula One season|debut season]], Villeneuve challenged teammate Hill for the title, winning four races and taking the fight to the final round in [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], where Villeneuve retired and Hill won the race and the title. Villeneuve, however, did win the following year's title, this time challenging [[Michael Schumacher]] and once again taking it to the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]], where Schumacher retired after [[Michael Schumacher#Championship-deciding collisions|the two collided]]. 1997 would be the last year in which Villeneuve would win a championship level race and finish the season in the top three. For [[1998 Formula One season|1998]], Villeneuve's Williams team had to fare with less competitive [[Mecachrome]] engines, and Villeneuve moved to the newly formed [[British American Racing]] team in [[1999 Formula One season|1999]]. He stayed there for the next four seasons but, following poor results he was replaced by former [[BRDC British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula Three Champion]] [[Takuma Sato]]. Villeneuve also drove for [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] at the end of [[2004 Formula One season|2004]], and [[Sauber]] in the [[2005 Formula One season|2005 season]] and eleven races of the [[2006 Formula One season|2006 season]] before suffering an injury in [[2006 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. Villeneuve was replaced by [[Robert Kubica]] and soon BMW and Villeneuve parted company.\n\nOutside Formula One, Villeneuve has taken on several new careers: in sportscar racing, racing for [[Peugeot]] in the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|2007]] and [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008]] [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], jumping to NASCAR in August 2007 and racing as an invited driver in the Argentinian [[TRV6|Top Race V6]] series and the Australian-based [[V8 Supercars|International V8 Supercars Championship]]. As a musician, he has released an album titled ''Private Paradise''.\n\nVilleneuve was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in 1998.\n\nVilleneuve remains the last racing driver to have won [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One]] and [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART IndyCar]] double driver titles to date.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n==Personal and early life==\nVilleneuve was born in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], Quebec, to aspiring [[Formula One]] driver [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and his wife Joann and raised in [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\">Collings and Edworthy, pg 272</ref> He has a sister Melanie and a [[Siblings#Half sibling|half sister]] Jessica.

When Villeneuve was eleven years old, his father was killed during the qualifying session for the [[1982 Belgian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuit Zolder|Zolder]] following a collision with [[Jochen Mass]].\n\nVilleneuve was engaged to Australian singer [[Dannii Minogue]] in the late 1990s and was once engaged to American ballerina Ellen Green. He married his Parisienne girlfriend Johanna Martinez on May 29, 2006, at a civil ceremony in Switzerland. After the ceremony, it was announced the Villeneuves were expecting a baby in November.

In return for helping in the garage, Villeneuve received guidance in terms of race craft as he attempted to hone his skills.<ref name=\"JV World Bio Page 1\" /> At the age of seventeen, Villeneuve was too young to obtain a racing license in both his native Canada and Italy and so, with help from the Canadian Automotive Federation, got a license from [[Andorra]].<ref name=\"JV World Bio Page 1\" />\n\nIn 1988, the seventeen-year-old entered the [[Alfa Romeo|Alfa]] Cup and, against former [[Formula One]] drivers [[Johnny Cecotto]] and [[Mauro Baldi]], finished the two legged race in tenth position.<ref name=\"JV World Bio Page 2\">{{cite web|url=http://jv-world.com/lifestyle/biography/story_36.shtml |title=Biography (Part II) |accessdate=2007-08-08 |publisher=Jacque Villeneuve Official Website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703224326/http://www.jv-world.com/lifestyle/biography/story_36.shtml |archivedate=July 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Two weeks later at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], Villeneuve was up against the likes of [[Riccardo Patrese]] and [[Nicola Larini]].<ref name=\"JV World Bio Page 2\" />\n\nVilleneuve competed in the Italian [[Formula Three]] series from 1989 through 1991, but failed to make an impression.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\nIn 1992, he raced in the Japanese Formula Three series with the [[TOM's]] team, winning three races and placing second in the championship, as well as third in the non-championship [[Macau Grand Prix]]. Daniel Desmarais acted as Jacques' facilitator during his season in Japan. \n\nVilleneuve soon received an invitation from [[Craig Pollock]] to compete as a one-off in the [[Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|Trois Rivi\u00e8res]] [[Formula Atlantic]] race, Villeneuve finished the race third and Pollock was impressed by Villeneuve, leading him to arrange for him to race in the North American [[Toyota Atlantic]] series for the upcoming season.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Villeneuve took seven [[pole positions]] and five race victories from the 15 races.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> However, a few crucial driving errors cost him the series title and so finished his debut season third in the standings.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\n===CART IndyCar World Series===\n[[File:Villeneuve 500.jpg|thumb|Villeneuve's [[1995 Indianapolis 500]]-winning car.]]\nHis Forsythe-Green team took Villeneuve up a level into the [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] championship in 1994. In his first year, Villeneuve came second at [[1994 Indianapolis 500|that year's Indianapolis 500]] and won his first race at [[Road America]], the circuit where his uncle had become the first Canadian to win a CART race nine years before. Villeneuve finished the season in sixth position; 131 points behind champion [[Al Unser Jr.]] and also taking the [[Champ Car|Rookie of the Year]] award.\n\nVilleneuve started the 1995 campaign strongly, winning the first race on the streets of Miami. Along with the win in Miami came three other victories, the most significant of which came at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] for the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]]. Despite a mid-race two lap penalty, Villeneuve fought his way back up through the field. Running second with less than 10 laps to go, Villeneuve claimed the lead from fellow Canadian [[Scott Goodyear]] after Goodyear was penalized for having passed the pace-car before the restart. With Goodyear out of the picture Villeneuve went on to win the race by two seconds over Brazilian [[Christian Fittipaldi]].\n\nHis performances, as well as his family name, brought him to the attention of [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], Managerial Director of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams Grand Prix team]]. Williams signed him to his [[Formula One]] team for [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] and Villeneuve began testing the Williams F1 car in 1995 after the IndyCar season. Villeneuve was the last CART IndyCar World Series champion before the 1996 CART/IRL split created two rival series: The [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) and the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve wins series title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o90jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9ywEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3486,648292&dq=jacques+villeneuve&hl=en|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=September 11, 1995|page=78}}</ref>\n\n===Formula One===\n\n====Williams====\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1996.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Formula One team at the 1996 [[Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1996\nVilleneuve signed a two-year contract with Williams with an option year available to him as well.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> Villeneuve impressed during his debut race in [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], taking pole position and almost won the race. But due to an oil leak Villeneuve was forced to slow down and allow teammate [[Damon Hill]] to pass and take victory at the opening round of the Championship, the Canadian however did manage to hold onto second place. It would be another 11 years before another driver finished on the podium on his debut which was [[Lewis Hamilton]] during the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]].\n\nVilleneuve won his first Formula One race at the fourth round at the [[1996 European Grand Prix|N\u00fcrburgring]] despite coming under pressure from the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] of [[Michael Schumacher]]. Villeneuve won a further three races and managed to take the title to the final round at [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]]. The Canadian and teammate Hill were the only drivers who could win the title, but with a gap of nine points between himself and Hill prior to the final race his chances of winning the title were slim. In the end, Hill won the race while Villeneuve retired on the 37th lap after his right-rear wheel came off.\n\nHaving won 4 races in his debut season, Villeneuve took the [[List of Formula One driver records|record]] for most wins in his first championship season. He also became the first driver in Formula One history to finish second in his first championship season. Both records were later equaled by [[Lewis Hamilton]] in {{F1|2007}}.\n\n;1997\nHill was dropped by Williams for {{F1|1997}}, making Villeneuve the team's lead driver. German [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was brought in to replace Hill. Villeneuve once again challenged for the title, but instead of Hill, the Canadian found himself battling with then double World Champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n[[David Coulthard]] took the opening race in Australia but Villeneuve took the next two wins in Brazil and Argentina. Five more victories came that season at the Spanish, British, Hungarian, Austrian and Luxembourg Grand Prix. Villeneuve also claimed ten pole positions. His main rival Schumacher had five wins of his own to set up a showdown at the final race of the season.\n\nAt Suzuka, the penultimate race of the season, Villeneuve started on pole but was placed at the back of the grid after ignoring yellow flags during Saturday practice. An appeal by Williams saw his position reinstated. However, Villeneuve finished 5th but was disqualified from the race leaving Schumacher leading the Drivers' Championship by one point.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve Awaits Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/14/sports/plus-auto-racing-villeneuve-awaits-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 14, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe title was decided at the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]]. Villeneuve came out on top and won the World Championship in only his second season, but the race was remembered for a collision between himself and title rival Schumacher. As Villeneuve passed Schumacher at the ''Dry Sac'' corner during the 48th lap, the German turned into the Canadian's car; leaving Villeneuve with a damaged sidepod. Villeneuve recovered however and took third place and the title while Schumacher retired and was disqualified from the Championship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve wins first title after Schumacher crashes out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/16176.stm|work=BBC News|date=October 26, 1997|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1998 Italy.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for Williams at the [[1998 Italian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1998\nVilleneuve's career went into sharp decline following his World Championship title. Remaining with Williams in {{f1|1998}} (and becoming the first Williams driver since [[Keke Rosberg]] in {{f1|1982}} to stay with the team for his title defense), he struggled with an underpowered [[Mecachrome]] engine which were basically rebadged [[Renault F1|Renault]] V10 engines from the previous season that despite some development had been overtaken in power by both Ferrari and the [[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes-Benz]] powered [[McLaren]]s. He failed to win a single race (like Hill the previous season), although he did finish on the podium twice in [[1998 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1998 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 21 points, 79 points behind Champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] in the McLaren-Mercedes.\n\n====British American Racing====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1999 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR in the team's first season, at the [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1999\nIn [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], Villeneuve joined the newly founded [[British American Racing]] (BAR) team, co-founded and partly owned by Villeneuve's personal manager, [[Craig Pollock]], and by [[Adrian Reynard]]. Joining him as his teammate was Brazilian [[Ricardo Zonta]]. There was a lot of media hype about the new squad, but despite the high expectations, BAR had a poor season, retiring from the first eleven races of the season and not scoring a single Championship point. At times the car showed a promising pace, with Villeneuve running in third place at Barcelona, but often technical problems ruined his chances. Villeneuve suffered a high speed crash during practice at the {{F1 GP|1999|Belgian}} at the Eau Rouge corner, from which he emerged unharmed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motor racing: Villeneuve plays down his brush with disaster|first=David|last=Tremayne|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-villeneuve-plays-down-his-brush-with-disaster-1118201.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 29, 1999}}</ref>\n\n;2000\n\nDespite the lack of a competitive car in 1999, Villeneuve remained loyal to Pollock's team, as did Zonta. The [[Supertec]] engines of the previous season were replaced by [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] engines, and the new BAR-Honda package proved to be more competitive, with Villeneuve finishing in the points on seven different occasions and almost securing a podium finish at the [[2000 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]].\n\n;2001\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2001 Canada 2.jpg|thumb|left|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nZonta left BAR in [[2001 Formula One season|2001]] to join [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] as a test driver. Zonta was replaced by experienced [[France|Frenchman]] [[Olivier Panis]]. Villeneuve was involved in a crash at the [[2001 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], the first race of the season, when he hit the back of [[Ralf Schumacher]]'s Williams. A track marshal was killed when a stray tyre hit him in the chest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve's Crash Debris Kills Track Official : Schumacher Captures Australian Grand Prix|first=Brad|last=Spurgeon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/05/sports/05iht-prix.2.t_0.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2001}}</ref> Villeneuve scored five points less than the previous season, but finished on the podium twice in [[2001 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and [[2001 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. The latter was the final podium finish of his Grand Prix career.\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2002.jpg|right|thumb|Villeneuve in 2002.]]\n\n;2002\n\nPollock was removed from his post as team manager in 2002 and was replaced by [[Prodrive]] boss [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]]. Along with Pollock, Richards removed Technical Director [[Malcolm Oastler]] and fifty members of staff at BAR.<ref name=\"F1 Rejects Sec 12\">[[F1 Rejects]], Paragraph 24</ref> Richards soon began to debate over Villeneuve's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]15 million annual salary.<ref name=\"F1 Rejects Sec 12\" /> From this point on, Villeneuve felt less comfortable at the team. The BAR 004 proved to be a much less competitive car than the teams' previous two, with neither Villeneuve or Panis scoring points consistently with only seven points scored between them, Villeneuve scoring four points to Panis's three.\n\n;2003\n\n[[File:Villeneuve BAR USGP 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]. Villeneuve retired from the race ten laps from the finish with an engine problem.]]\n\nWith one year left to run on his contract Villeneuve turned down a lucrative offer to spend a season racing in CART before returning to BAR for 2004 and 2005, a deal which Villeneuve claimed was spoken about but never actually produced for him to sign. Instead, he decided that he would see out his present deal in the hope of landing a role at another Grand Prix team the following year. Villeneuve was joined by [[Jenson Button]] from [[Renault F1|Renault]] in [[2003 Formula One season|2003]] as Panis was offered a position at [[Toyota F1|Toyota]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve rejects CART return|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2220045.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=August 27, 2002}}</ref> Button would prove to become the second of Villeneuve's teammates to outscore him in the Drivers' Championship as, unlike Villeneuve, Button was able to score consistently with the BAR 005, finishing in the points every two races on average.\n\nVilleneuve was criticized by the media for being outpaced by his inexperienced teammate and before the final round in [[2003 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]; he was replaced by former [[British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula 3]] Champion [[Takuma Sato]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sato replaces Villeneuve|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3167332.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n====Renault====\nWith no contract for 2004, Villeneuve was forced to take a sabbatical, but maintained that he wanted to return to the sport. He continued training and made a special appearance at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] driving his late father's Ferrari. In September, Villeneuve returned to Formula One, driving the final three Grands Prix of the season for the French [[Renault F1|Renault]] team. [[Jarno Trulli]] had fallen out of favour and team boss [[Flavio Briatore]] felt Villeneuve would be worth a gamble.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renault hand Villeneuve an F1 lifeline|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/sports/2004/sep/15f1.htm|publisher=rediff sports|accessdate=September 15, 2004}}</ref> Although vowing to help Renault achieve second place in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of his former team BAR, Villeneuve failed to score a single point, unable to finish any of his races on the lead lap; Renault settled for third in the final standings. Villeneuve admitted that the enforced lay-off had cost him vital seat time. With the cars so much faster than in 2003, he found it difficult to adapt, and with an up-and-coming [[Fernando Alonso]] as teammate his task was made all the more difficult. Just before his 3-race Renault comeback, Villeneuve signed a two-year contract to drive for [[Sauber]], starting in [[2005 Formula One season|2005]].<ref>[http://xserve2.com/ns/ns13501.html GrandPrix.com&nbsp;\u2013 Sauber announces Villeneuve deal&nbsp;\u2013 15 Sept. 2004]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Sauber====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2005 Canada 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Villeneuve driving for [[Sauber]] at the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n;2005\nHis Sauber debut at the [[2005 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] saw him start on the grid in fourth position, although he would finish the race nine places down the order in thirteenth and a lap down. For the opening three races he was the slowest driver on [[Michelin]] tyres, and rumors began to spread that he would soon be replaced. The rumors proved unfounded, and at [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] he scored his first points for the team with a fourth place. The pressure was soon back on him when he forced teammate [[Felipe Massa]] off the track when attempting to overtake the Brazilian in [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], ruining both their races.\nTowards the end of the season, his pace improved and he scored more points at Belgium, where he finished sixth, moving ahead of Massa in the championship tables, although Massa repassed him after finishing 6th in the season finale in China. In terms of speed, the two teammates were fairly evenly matched by the end of the year. Massa was later drafted into [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to support Michael Schumacher's 2006 campaign.\n\nAfter much uncertainty, in late 2005 BMW confirmed that Villeneuve would race for BMW Sauber in 2006. GP2 frontrunner [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Indy Racing League|Indycar]] champion [[Dan Wheldon]] had both been linked with the seat, but BMW opted to honour Villeneuve's contract; to cut the contract would possibly have been an expensive exercise that would have cost them around [[United States dollar|$]]2 million, and Villeneuve was popular with the sponsors and team personnel.\n\n;2006\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve Canada 2006.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Villeneuve at the [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nSeveral changes were made at Sauber during the off season. First, the Swiss team were bought by [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] and renamed BMW Sauber. The German manufacturer wished to start their own works team following a six-year partnership with Villeneuve's former employers Williams. In addition, Massa left Sauber for the vacant role left by [[Rubens Barrichello]] at [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] was brought in to replace him. Villeneuve scored seven points during the first twelve rounds of the season. But at the [[2006 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Villeneuve had allegedly sustained an injury in a crash on lap 31.<ref name=\"Kubica replaces Villeneuve\">{{cite news | title=Kubica replaces Villeneuve | publisher=GrandPrix.com | date= August 1, 2006 | url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17241.html | accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Villeneuve Germany2006.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Villeneuve walks away from his crashed [[BMW Sauber F1.06|F1.06]] at the [[2006 German Grand Prix]], his last F1 race.]]\n\nAfter replacing Villeneuve in [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], test driver [[Robert Kubica]] drove to a solid seventh place, despite the chaotic wet conditions, but was later disqualified because his car was too light.

Villeneuve won the [[1995 PPG Indy Car World Series|1995]] [[Champ Car|CART]] Championship, the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995]] [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[1997 Formula One season|1997]] [[Formula One]] World Championship, making him only the third driver after [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] to achieve such a feat. {{As of|2019}}, no other Canadian has won the Indianapolis 500 or the Formula One Drivers' title.\n\nFollowing two successful years in [[Champ Car|CART]], Villeneuve moved into [[Formula One]] with the front-running [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team, alongside [[Damon Hill]]. In his [[1996 Formula One season|debut season]], Villeneuve challenged teammate Hill for the title, winning four races and taking the fight to the final round in [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], where Villeneuve retired and Hill won the race and the title. Villeneuve, however, did win the following year's title, this time challenging [[Michael Schumacher]] and once again taking it to the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]], where Schumacher retired after [[Michael Schumacher#Championship-deciding collisions|the two collided]]. 1997 would be the last year in which Villeneuve would win a championship level race and finish the season in the top three. For [[1998 Formula One season|1998]], Villeneuve's Williams team had to fare with less competitive [[Mecachrome]] engines, and Villeneuve moved to the newly formed [[British American Racing]] team in [[1999 Formula One season|1999]]. He stayed there for the next four seasons but, following poor results he was replaced by former [[BRDC British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula Three Champion]] [[Takuma Sato]]. Villeneuve also drove for [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] at the end of [[2004 Formula One season|2004]], and [[Sauber]] in the [[2005 Formula One season|2005 season]] and eleven races of the [[2006 Formula One season|2006 season]] before suffering an injury in [[2006 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. Villeneuve was replaced by [[Robert Kubica]] and soon BMW and Villeneuve parted company.\n\nOutside Formula One, Villeneuve has taken on several new careers: in sportscar racing, racing for [[Peugeot]] in the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|2007]] and [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008]] [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], jumping to NASCAR in August 2007 and racing as an invited driver in the Argentinian [[TRV6|Top Race V6]] series and the Australian-based [[V8 Supercars|International V8 Supercars Championship]]. As a musician, he has released an album titled ''Private Paradise''.\n\nVilleneuve was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in 1998.\n\nVilleneuve remains the last racing driver to won [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One]] and [[Championship Auto Racing Teams|CART IndyCar]] double driver titles to date.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n==Personal and early life==\nVilleneuve was born in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], Quebec, to aspiring [[Formula One]] driver [[Gilles Villeneuve]] and his wife Joann and raised in [[Monaco]].<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\">Collings and Edworthy, pg 272</ref> He has a sister Melanie and a [[Siblings#Half sibling|half sister]] Jessica.

Daniel Desmarais acted as Jacques' facilitator during his season in Japan. \n\nVilleneuve soon received an invitation from [[Craig Pollock]] to compete as a one-off in the [[Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res|Trois Rivi\u00e8res]] [[Formula Atlantic]] race, Villeneuve finished the race third and Pollock was impressed by Villeneuve, leading him to arrange for him to race in the North American [[Toyota Atlantic]] series for the upcoming season.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\nDuring the 1993 season, Villeneuve took seven [[pole positions]] and five race victories from the 15 races.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> However, a few crucial driving errors cost him the series title and so finished his debut season third in the standings.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" />\n\n===CART IndyCar World Series===\n[[File:Villeneuve 500.jpg|thumb|Villeneuve's [[1995 Indianapolis 500]]-winning car.]]\nHis Forsythe-Green team took Villeneuve up a level into the [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] championship in 1994. In his first year, Villeneuve came second at [[1994 Indianapolis 500|that year's Indianapolis 500]] and won his first race at [[Road America]], the circuit where his uncle had become the first Canadian to win a CART race nine years before. Villeneuve finished the season in sixth position; 131 points behind champion [[Al Unser Jr.]] and also taking the [[Champ Car|Rookie of the Year]] award.\n\nVilleneuve started the 1995 campaign strongly, winning the first race on the streets of Miami. Along with the win in Miami came three other victories, the most significant of which came at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] for the [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]]. Despite a mid-race two lap penalty, Villeneuve fought his way back up through the field. Running second with less than 10 laps to go, Villeneuve claimed the lead from fellow Canadian [[Scott Goodyear]] after Goodyear was penalized for having passed the pace-car before the restart. With Goodyear out of the picture Villeneuve went on to win the race by two seconds over Brazilian [[Christian Fittipaldi]].\n\nHis performances, as well as his family name, brought him to the attention of [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], Managerial Director of the [[WilliamsF1|Williams Grand Prix team]]. Williams signed him to his [[Formula One]] team for [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] and Villeneuve began testing the Williams F1 car in 1995 after the IndyCar season. Villeneuve was the last CART IndyCar World Series champion before the 1996 CART/IRL split created two rival series: The [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) and the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve wins series title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o90jAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9ywEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3486,648292&dq=jacques+villeneuve&hl=en|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=September 11, 1995|page=78}}</ref>\n\n===Formula One===\n\n====Williams====\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1996.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Formula One team at the 1996 [[Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1996\nVilleneuve signed a two-year contract with Williams with an option year available to him as well.<ref name=\"Collings and Edworthy pg. 272\" /> Villeneuve impressed during his debut race in [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], taking pole position and almost won the race. But due to an oil leak Villeneuve was forced to slow down and allow teammate [[Damon Hill]] to pass and take victory at the opening round of the Championship, the Canadian however did manage to hold onto second place. It would be another 11 years before another driver finished on the podium on his debut which was [[Lewis Hamilton]] during the [[2007 Australian Grand Prix]].\n\nVilleneuve won his first Formula One race at the fourth round at the [[1996 European Grand Prix|N\u00fcrburgring]] despite coming under pressure from the [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] of [[Michael Schumacher]]. Villeneuve won a further three races and managed to take the title to the final round at [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Suzuka]]. The Canadian and teammate Hill were the only drivers who could win the title, but with a gap of nine points between himself and Hill prior to the final race his chances of winning the title were slim. In the end, Hill won the race while Villeneuve retired on the 37th lap after his right-rear wheel came off.\n\nHaving won 4 races in his debut season, Villeneuve took the [[List of Formula One driver records|record]] for most wins in his first championship season. He also became the first driver in Formula One history to finish second in his first championship season. Both records were later equaled by [[Lewis Hamilton]] in {{F1|2007}}.\n\n;1997\nHill was dropped by Williams for {{F1|1997}}, making Villeneuve the team's lead driver. German [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was brought in to replace Hill. Villeneuve once again challenged for the title, but instead of Hill, the Canadian found himself battling with then double World Champion Michael Schumacher.\n\n[[David Coulthard]] took the opening race in Australia but Villeneuve took the next two wins in Brazil and Argentina. Five more victories came that season at the Spanish, British, Hungarian, Austrian and Luxembourg Grand Prix. Villeneuve also claimed ten pole positions. His main rival Schumacher had five wins of his own to set up a showdown at the final race of the season.\n\nAt Suzuka, the penultimate race of the season, Villeneuve started on pole but was placed at the back of the grid after ignoring yellow flags during Saturday practice. An appeal by Williams saw his position reinstated. However, Villeneuve finished 5th but was disqualified from the race leaving Schumacher leading the Drivers' Championship by one point.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve Awaits Ruling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/14/sports/plus-auto-racing-villeneuve-awaits-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 14, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe title was decided at the final round in [[1997 European Grand Prix|Jerez]]. Villeneuve came out on top and won the World Championship in only his second season, but the race was remembered for a collision between himself and title rival Schumacher. As Villeneuve passed Schumacher at the ''Dry Sac'' corner during the 48th lap, the German turned into the Canadian's car; leaving Villeneuve with a damaged sidepod. Villeneuve recovered however and took third place and the title while Schumacher retired and was disqualified from the Championship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve wins first title after Schumacher crashes out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/16176.stm|work=BBC News|date=October 26, 1997|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1998 Italy.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for Williams at the [[1998 Italian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1998\nVilleneuve's career went into sharp decline following his World Championship title. Remaining with Williams in {{f1|1998}} (and becoming the first Williams driver since [[Keke Rosberg]] in {{f1|1982}} to stay with the team for his title defense), he struggled with an underpowered [[Mecachrome]] engine which were basically rebadged [[Renault F1|Renault]] V10 engines from the previous season that despite some development had been overtaken in power by both Ferrari and the [[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes-Benz]] powered [[McLaren]]s. He failed to win a single race (like Hill the previous season), although he did finish on the podium twice in [[1998 German Grand Prix|Germany]] and [[1998 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]]. Villeneuve finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 21 points, 79 points behind Champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] in the McLaren-Mercedes.\n\n====British American Racing====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1999 Canada.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR in the team's first season, at the [[1999 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\n;1999\nIn [[1999 Formula One season|1999]], Villeneuve joined the newly founded [[British American Racing]] (BAR) team, co-founded and partly owned by Villeneuve's personal manager, [[Craig Pollock]], and by [[Adrian Reynard]]. Joining him as his teammate was Brazilian [[Ricardo Zonta]]. There was a lot of media hype about the new squad, but despite the high expectations, BAR had a poor season, retiring from the first eleven races of the season and not scoring a single Championship point. At times the car showed a promising pace, with Villeneuve running in third place at Barcelona, but often technical problems ruined his chances. Villeneuve suffered a high speed crash during practice at the {{F1 GP|1999|Belgian}} at the Eau Rouge corner, from which he emerged unharmed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Motor racing: Villeneuve plays down his brush with disaster|first=David|last=Tremayne|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-villeneuve-plays-down-his-brush-with-disaster-1118201.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=August 29, 1999}}</ref>\n\n;2000\n\nDespite the lack of a competitive car in 1999, Villeneuve remained loyal to Pollock's team, as did Zonta. The [[Supertec]] engines of the previous season were replaced by [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] engines, and the new BAR-Honda package proved to be more competitive, with Villeneuve finishing in the points on seven different occasions and almost securing a podium finish at the [[2000 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]].\n\n;2001\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2001 Canada 2.jpg|thumb|left|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2001 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nZonta left BAR in [[2001 Formula One season|2001]] to join [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] as a test driver. Zonta was replaced by experienced [[France|Frenchman]] [[Olivier Panis]]. Villeneuve was involved in a crash at the [[2001 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]], the first race of the season, when he hit the back of [[Ralf Schumacher]]'s Williams. A track marshal was killed when a stray tyre hit him in the chest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve's Crash Debris Kills Track Official : Schumacher Captures Australian Grand Prix|first=Brad|last=Spurgeon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/05/sports/05iht-prix.2.t_0.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 5, 2001}}</ref> Villeneuve scored five points less than the previous season, but finished on the podium twice in [[2001 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and [[2001 German Grand Prix|Germany]]. The latter was the final podium finish of his Grand Prix career.\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2002.jpg|right|thumb|Villeneuve in 2002.]]\n\n;2002\n\nPollock was removed from his post as team manager in 2002 and was replaced by [[Prodrive]] boss [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]]. Along with Pollock, Richards removed Technical Director [[Malcolm Oastler]] and fifty members of staff at BAR.<ref name=\"F1 Rejects Sec 12\">[[F1 Rejects]], Paragraph 24</ref> Richards soon began to debate over Villeneuve's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]15 million annual salary.<ref name=\"F1 Rejects Sec 12\" /> From this point on, Villeneuve felt less comfortable at the team. The BAR 004 proved to be a much less competitive car than the teams' previous two, with neither Villeneuve or Panis scoring points consistently with only seven points scored between them, Villeneuve scoring four points to Panis's three.\n\n;2003\n\n[[File:Villeneuve BAR USGP 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Villeneuve driving for BAR at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]. Villeneuve retired from the race ten laps from the finish with an engine problem.]]\n\nWith one year left to run on his contract Villeneuve turned down a lucrative offer to spend a season racing in CART before returning to BAR for 2004 and 2005, a deal which Villeneuve claimed was spoken about but never actually produced for him to sign. Instead, he decided that he would see out his present deal in the hope of landing a role at another Grand Prix team the following year. Villeneuve was joined by [[Jenson Button]] from [[Renault F1|Renault]] in [[2003 Formula One season|2003]] as Panis was offered a position at [[Toyota F1|Toyota]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Villeneuve rejects CART return|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2220045.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=August 27, 2002}}</ref> Button would prove to become the second of Villeneuve's teammates to outscore him in the Drivers' Championship as, unlike Villeneuve, Button was able to score consistently with the BAR 005, finishing in the points every two races on average.\n\nVilleneuve was criticized by the media for being outpaced by his inexperienced teammate and before the final round in [[2003 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]; he was replaced by former [[British Formula 3 Championship|British Formula 3]] Champion [[Takuma Sato]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sato replaces Villeneuve|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3167332.stm|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=October 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n====Renault====\nWith no contract for 2004, Villeneuve was forced to take a sabbatical, but maintained that he wanted to return to the sport. He continued training and made a special appearance at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] driving his late father's Ferrari. In September, Villeneuve returned to Formula One, driving the final three Grands Prix of the season for the French [[Renault F1|Renault]] team. [[Jarno Trulli]] had fallen out of favour and team boss [[Flavio Briatore]] felt Villeneuve would be worth a gamble.<ref>{{cite web|title=Renault hand Villeneuve an F1 lifeline|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/sports/2004/sep/15f1.htm|publisher=rediff sports|accessdate=September 15, 2004}}</ref> Although vowing to help Renault achieve second place in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of his former team BAR, Villeneuve failed to score a single point, unable to finish any of his races on the lead lap; Renault settled for third in the final standings. Villeneuve admitted that the enforced lay-off had cost him vital seat time. With the cars so much faster than in 2003, he found it difficult to adapt, and with an up-and-coming [[Fernando Alonso]] as teammate his task was made all the more difficult. Just before his 3-race Renault comeback, Villeneuve signed a two-year contract to drive for [[Sauber]], starting in [[2005 Formula One season|2005]].<ref>[http://xserve2.com/ns/ns13501.html GrandPrix.com&nbsp;\u2013 Sauber announces Villeneuve deal&nbsp;\u2013 15 Sept. 2004]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Sauber====\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 2005 Canada 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Villeneuve driving for [[Sauber]] at the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n;2005\nHis Sauber debut at the [[2005 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] saw him start on the grid in fourth position, although he would finish the race nine places down the order in thirteenth and a lap down. For the opening three races he was the slowest driver on [[Michelin]] tyres, and rumors began to spread that he would soon be replaced. The rumors proved unfounded, and at [[2005 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] he scored his first points for the team with a fourth place. The pressure was soon back on him when he forced teammate [[Felipe Massa]] off the track when attempting to overtake the Brazilian in [[2005 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], ruining both their races.\nTowards the end of the season, his pace improved and he scored more points at Belgium, where he finished sixth, moving ahead of Massa in the championship tables, although Massa repassed him after finishing 6th in the season finale in China. In terms of speed, the two teammates were fairly evenly matched by the end of the year. Massa was later drafted into [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to support Michael Schumacher's 2006 campaign.\n\nAfter much uncertainty, in late 2005 BMW confirmed that Villeneuve would race for BMW Sauber in 2006. GP2 frontrunner [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Indy Racing League|Indycar]] champion [[Dan Wheldon]] had both been linked with the seat, but BMW opted to honour Villeneuve's contract; to cut the contract would possibly have been an expensive exercise that would have cost them around [[United States dollar|$]]2 million, and Villeneuve was popular with the sponsors and team personnel.\n\n;2006\n\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve Canada 2006.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Villeneuve at the [[2006 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]\n\nSeveral changes were made at Sauber during the off season. First, the Swiss team were bought by [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]] and renamed BMW Sauber. The German manufacturer wished to start their own works team following a six-year partnership with Villeneuve's former employers Williams. In addition, Massa left Sauber for the vacant role left by [[Rubens Barrichello]] at [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and [[Nick Heidfeld]] was brought in to replace him. Villeneuve scored seven points during the first twelve rounds of the season. But at the [[2006 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Villeneuve had allegedly sustained an injury in a crash on lap 31.<ref name=\"Kubica replaces Villeneuve\">{{cite news | title=Kubica replaces Villeneuve | publisher=GrandPrix.com | date= August 1, 2006 | url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns17241.html | accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Villeneuve Germany2006.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Villeneuve walks away from his crashed [[BMW Sauber F1.06|F1.06]] at the [[2006 German Grand Prix]], his last F1 race.]]\n\nAfter replacing Villeneuve in [[2006 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], test driver [[Robert Kubica]] drove to a solid seventh place, despite the chaotic wet conditions, but was later disqualified because his car was too light.

The report went on to suggest that Villeneuve Racing had satisfied the entry criteria set by the FIA and had joined two other outfits on a shortlist of teams under consideration for the grid entry.

He began to study music under the guidance of his father - conductor and teacher [[Alexander Ignatievich Klimov]]. From the age of 7 he studied (with a break for evacuation in Stalingrad during the war) at the Odessa Music Boarding School for Gifted Children with [[Pyotr Stolyarsky]] (now called the [[School of Stolyarsky]]), Starting in 1945, he studied with B.Z. Mordkovich. In 1949 he performed public concerts featuring repertoire by [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[W.A. Mozart]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]].

New Cross is near [[St Johns, London|St Johns]], [[Telegraph Hill, Lewisham|Telegraph Hill]], [[Nunhead]], [[Peckham]], [[Brockley]], [[Deptford]] and [[Greenwich]], and home to [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], [[Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College]] and [[Addey and Stanhope School]].\n\nNew Cross Gate, on the west of New Cross, is named after the New Cross tollgate, established in 1718 by the New Cross Turnpike Trust. It is the location of [[New Cross station]] and [[New Cross Gate station]]. New Cross Gate corresponds to the manor and district formerly known as [[Hatcham]].<ref name=mills>Mills, A., ''Dictionary of London Place Names'', (2001), Oxford</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ward of New Cross.GIF|thumb|200px|The electoral ward of New Cross (red) within the London Borough of Lewisham (orange)]]\nThe area was originally known as [[Hatcham]] (the name persists in the title of the [[Anglican]] parishes of St. James, Hatcham along with its school, and All Saints, Hatcham Park). The earliest reference to Hatcham is the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Hacheham''. It was held by the [[Bishop of Lisieux]] from the [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop of Bayeux]]. According to the entry in the Domesday Book Hatcham's assets were: 3 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s; 3 [[plough]]s, {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] worth 3 [[hog (swine)|hog]] and rendered \u00a32.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |archivedate=15 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHatcham tithes were paid to [[Bermondsey Abbey]] from 1173 until the dissolution of the monasteries. A series of individuals then held land locally before the manor was bought in the 17th century by the [[Worshipful Company of Haberdashers|Haberdashers' Company]], a wealthy [[livery company]] that was instrumental in the area's development in the 19th century. Telegraph Hill was for many years covered by market gardens also owned by the [[Worshipful Company of Haberdashers]]. Until the creation of the [[London County Council]] in 1889, the area was a part of the [[counties]] of [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]].\n\nNew Cross is believed to have taken its name from a coaching house originally known as the Golden Cross, which stood close to the current New Cross House pub. The diarist [[John Evelyn]], who lived in [[Deptford]], wrote in 1675 that he met a friend at 'New Crosse' in his coach before travelling down through Kent and on to France.\n\nIn the later 19th century, the area became known as the New Cross Tangle on account of its numerous railway lines, workshops and two stations \u2014 both originally called New Cross (one was later renamed New Cross Gate).\n\n[[George England and Co.|Hatcham Iron Works]] in Pomeroy Street was an important [[steam locomotive]] factory, the scene of a bitter confrontation in 1865 between its manager, [[George England]], and the workers. The Strike Committee met at the Crown and Anchor pub in New Cross Road, now the site of Hong Kong City Chinese restaurant. George England's house, Hatcham Lodge, is now 56 Kender Street.<ref>{{Quine-FR}}</ref>\n\nNew Cross bus garage was formerly the largest tram depot in London, opening in 1906. During the 1926 General Strike in support of the miners, strikebreakers were brought in to drive trams from the depot. On 7 May, police baton charges were launched to clear a crowd of 2\u20133,000 pickets blockading the entrance (reported as \"Rowdyism in New Cross\" by the ''Kentish Mercury'').\n\nThe last [[Trams in London|London tram]], in July 1952, ran from [[Woolwich]] to New Cross. It was driven through enormous crowds, finally arriving at its destination in the early hours of 6 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/july.htm|title=Greenwich Guide - Greenwich Day by Day - July|work=greenwich-guide.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 1944 a [[V-2]] rocket exploded at the [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] store in New Cross Road (on the site later occupied by an [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] supermarket), 168 people were killed, and 121 were seriously injured. It was London's most devastating V-bombing of the entire war. On Wednesday 25 November 2009 a new commemorative plaque was unveiled on the site by the Mayor of Lewisham, marking the 65th anniversary of the explosion.\n\nIn August 1977 the area saw the so-called [[Battle of Lewisham]], during which the far right [[British National Front]] were beaten back by [[militant anti-fascism|militant anti-fascists]] and local people.\n\nOn 18 January 1981 13 young black people were killed in the [[New Cross Fire]] at a party at 439 New Cross Road. Suspicions that the fire was caused by a racist attack, and apparent official indifference to the deaths, led to the largest ever political mobilisation of black people seen in [[UK|Britain]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Music===\nDuring the 1980s, the [[Goldsmiths Tavern]] hosted alternative cabaret nights, organised by [[Nikky Smedley]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Playing host to fledgling acts including [[The Cholmondeleys]], [[Julian Clary]] and [[Vic Reeves]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Goldsmiths' Students' Union also had a reputation for putting on established and up and coming bands of the era including [[The B-52's]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Monochrome Set]], [[Simply Red]], [[Wet Wet Wet]] and [[Wild Willy Barrett]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

Morton, a [[cannery]] and food processing plant in [[Millwall]] on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in 1885, was based at [[The Old Den|The Den]] in Cold Blow Lane from 1910 to 1993. The ground attracted crowds of more than 45,000 at its peak, but by the 1980s was notorious for the club's repeated incidents of [[football hooliganism]]. Millwall moved a short distance to a new stadium, [[The New Den]], situated off Ilderton Road and just within [[Bermondsey]], at the start of the 1993\u201394 season. The club remains within the New Cross electoral ward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openlylocal.com/wards/1625-New-Cross|title=New Cross ward :: London Borough of Lewisham :: Openly Local|work=openlylocal.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520234200/http://openlylocal.com/wards/1625-New-Cross|archivedate=20 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway racing]] was staged at the [[New Cross Stadium|New Cross Speedway and Greyhound Stadium]], situated at the end of Hornshay Street, off Ilderton Road. The venue became home to the New Cross Rangers in 1934 when the Crystal Palace promotion moved en bloc. The track, reputed to be one of the shortest and known as \"The Frying Pan Bowl\", operated until 1939 and re-opened in 1946 running until the early 1950s. The track re-opened for a short spell 1959 - 1961 and closed its doors to the sport for the last time mid season 1963. The stadium was also the scene of the UK's first [[Stock car racing|stock car race]] at Easter 1954, with 26,000 in the crowd and thousands more locked outside. The site of the Stadium is now an open space, Bridge House Meadows. The 1949 speedway film ''[[Once a Jolly Swagman]]'', starring [[Dirk Bogarde]], was filmed at New Cross.\n\n===Dance===\n\nFor many years New Cross was home to the Laban Centre, now [[Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance]] which was based at Laurie Grove producing choreographers such as [[Matthew Bourne]] and [[Lea Anderson]]. In 2002 Laban moved to new studios in Deptford. However, it still uses its New Cross campus, where studios have since been refurbished.\n\n=== Literature ===\nIts library, New Cross Learning, which was formerly known as the New Cross People's Library, was saved from permanent closure after government cuts. A series of protests in 2011, namely from the \u2018Save New Cross Library Campaign\u2019 and the subsequent media coverage, garnered enough support to see it re-open in 2013 as a community led library. It now offers learning activities and workshops, and has a lending catalogue of over 5,000 books.\n\n==Demography==\nThe New Cross ward of Lewisham has the lowest female life expectancy of all the wards of Greater London: 77.6 years. For males the rate was 74.3 years, tied with Camberwell Green in Southwark and only higher than Selhurst ward in Croydon.<ref>https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Pimlott Building1.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Pimlott]] Building]]\n[[File:RISB.JPG|thumb|Goldsmith's Library]]\n\nThe proximity of New Cross to [[Deptford]] and [[Greenwich]], both of which have strong maritime connections, led to the establishment of the [[Royal Naval School]] in New Cross in 1843 (designed by architect [[John Shaw Jr]], 1803\u20131870) to house \"the sons of impecunious naval officers\". The school relocated further south-east to [[Mottingham]] in 1889, and the former school building was bought by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, who opened the Goldsmiths\u2019 Company's Technical and Recreative Institute in 1891. This was in turn handed over to the University of London in 1904 and is now [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].\n\nThe former Deptford Town Hall building in New Cross Road, now also used by Goldsmiths, was built in the [[Edwardian Baroque]] style by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester|Lanchester]] and Rickards, 1903\u20135.

It opened as the New Cross Super Kinema in 1925, with a cinema on the ground floor and the New Cross Palais de Danse above, as well as a cafe. The name was shortened to New Cross Kinema from 1927, the plain Kinema in 1948, and finally Gaumont in 1950. It closed in August 1960, and remained derelict for some time. Part of the building was demolished before the old dancehall became The Harp Club and then The Venue in the late 1980s.\n\nAlso, the Duke of Albany [[public house]] (converted to flats in 2008) was the facade for The Winchester pub in the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.\n{{-}}\n\n==Transport==\n===Rail===\nThe area is served by two railway stations, [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]].\n\nBoth stations are served by [[London Overground]].

New Cross is near [[St Johns, London|St Johns]], [[Telegraph Hill, Lewisham|Telegraph Hill]], [[Nunhead]], [[Peckham]], [[Brockley]], [[Deptford]] and [[Greenwich]], and home to [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], [[Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College]] and [[Addey and Stanhope School]].\n\nNew Cross Gate, on the west of New Cross, is named after the New Cross tollgate, established in 1718 by the New Cross Turnpike Trust. It is the location of [[New Cross station]] and [[New Cross Gate station]]. New Cross Gate corresponds to the manor and district formerly known as [[Hatcham]].<ref name=mills>Mills, A., ''Dictionary of London Place Names'', (2001), Oxford</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ward of New Cross.GIF|thumb|200px|The electoral ward of New Cross (red) within the London Borough of Lewisham (orange)]]\nThe area was originally known as [[Hatcham]] (the name persists in the title of the [[Anglican]] parishes of St. James, Hatcham along with its school, and All Saints, Hatcham Park). The earliest reference to Hatcham is the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Hacheham''. It was held by the [[Bishop of Lisieux]] from the [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop of Bayeux]]. According to the entry in the Domesday Book Hatcham's assets were: 3 [[hide (unit)|hide]]s; 3 [[plough]]s, {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] worth 3 [[hog (swine)|hog]] and rendered \u00a32.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015325/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |archivedate=15 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHatcham tithes were paid to [[Bermondsey Abbey]] from 1173 until the dissolution of the monasteries. A series of individuals then held land locally before the manor was bought in the 17th century by the [[Worshipful Company of Haberdashers|Haberdashers' Company]], a wealthy [[livery company]] that was instrumental in the area's development in the 19th century. Telegraph Hill was for many years covered by market gardens also owned by the [[Worshipful Company of Haberdashers]]. Until the creation of the [[London County Council]] in 1889, the area was a part of the [[counties]] of [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]].\n\nNew Cross is believed to have taken its name from a coaching house originally known as the Golden Cross, which stood close to the current New Cross House pub. The diarist [[John Evelyn]], who lived in [[Deptford]], wrote in 1675 that he met a friend at 'New Crosse' in his coach before travelling down through Kent and on to France.\n\nIn the later 19th century, the area became known as the New Cross Tangle on account of its numerous railway lines, workshops and two stations \u2014 both originally called New Cross (one was later renamed New Cross Gate).\n\n[[George England and Co.|Hatcham Iron Works]] in Pomeroy Street was an important [[steam locomotive]] factory, the scene of a bitter confrontation in 1865 between its manager, [[George England]], and the workers. The Strike Committee met at the Crown and Anchor pub in New Cross Road, now the site of Hong Kong City Chinese restaurant. George England's house, Hatcham Lodge, is now 56 Kender Street.<ref>{{Quine-FR}}</ref>\n\nNew Cross bus garage was formerly the largest tram depot in London, opening in 1906. During the 1926 General Strike in support of the miners, strikebreakers were brought in to drive trams from the depot. On 7 May, police baton charges were launched to clear a crowd of 2\u20133,000 pickets blockading the entrance (reported as \"Rowdyism in New Cross\" by the ''Kentish Mercury'').\n\nThe last [[Trams in London|London tram]], in July 1952, ran from [[Woolwich]] to New Cross. It was driven through enormous crowds, finally arriving at its destination in the early hours of 6 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/july.htm|title=Greenwich Guide - Greenwich Day by Day - July|work=greenwich-guide.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 1944 a [[V-2]] rocket exploded at the [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]] store in New Cross Road (on the site later occupied by an [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] supermarket), 168 people were killed, and 121 were seriously injured. It was London's most devastating V-bombing of the entire war. On Wednesday 25 November 2009 a new commemorative plaque was unveiled on the site by the Mayor of Lewisham, marking the 65th anniversary of the explosion.\n\nIn August 1977 the area saw the so-called [[Battle of Lewisham]], during which the far right [[British National Front]] were beaten back by [[militant anti-fascism|militant anti-fascists]] and local people.\n\nOn 18 January 1981 13 young black people were killed in the [[New Cross Fire]] at a party at 439 New Cross Road. Suspicions that the fire was caused by a racist attack, and apparent official indifference to the deaths, led to the largest ever political mobilisation of black people seen in [[UK|Britain]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Music===\nDuring the 1980s, the [[Goldsmiths Tavern]] hosted alternative cabaret nights, organised by [[Nikky Smedley]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Playing host to fledgling acts including [[The Cholmondeleys]], [[Julian Clary]] and [[Vic Reeves]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Goldsmiths' Students' Union also had a reputation for putting on established and up and coming bands of the era including [[The B-52's]], [[The Pogues]], [[The Monochrome Set]], [[Simply Red]], [[Wet Wet Wet]] and [[Wild Willy Barrett]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

Morton, a [[cannery]] and food processing plant in [[Millwall]] on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in 1885, was based at [[The Old Den|The Den]] in Cold Blow Lane from 1910 to 1993. The ground attracted crowds of more than 45,000 at its peak, but by the 1980s was notorious for the club's repeated incidents of [[football hooliganism]]. Millwall moved a short distance to a new stadium, [[The New Den]], situated off Ilderton Road and just within [[Bermondsey]], at the start of the 1993\u201394 season. The club remains within the New Cross electoral ward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openlylocal.com/wards/1625-New-Cross|title=New Cross ward :: London Borough of Lewisham :: Openly Local|work=openlylocal.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520234200/http://openlylocal.com/wards/1625-New-Cross|archivedate=20 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway racing]] was staged at the [[New Cross Stadium|New Cross Speedway and Greyhound Stadium]], situated at the end of Hornshay Street, off Ilderton Road. The venue became home to the New Cross Rangers in 1934 when the Crystal Palace promotion moved en bloc. The track, reputed to be one of the shortest and known as \"The Frying Pan Bowl\", operated until 1939 and re-opened in 1946 running until the early 1950s. The track re-opened for a short spell 1959 - 1961 and closed its doors to the sport for the last time mid season 1963. The stadium was also the scene of the UK's first [[Stock car racing|stock car race]] at Easter 1954, with 26,000 in the crowd and thousands more locked outside. The site of the Stadium is now an open space, Bridge House Meadows. The 1949 speedway film ''[[Once a Jolly Swagman]]'', starring [[Dirk Bogarde]], was filmed at New Cross.\n\n===Dance===\n\nFor many years New Cross was home to the Laban Centre, now [[Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance]] which was based at Laurie Grove producing choreographers such as [[Matthew Bourne]] and [[Lea Anderson]]. In 2002 Laban moved to new studios in Deptford. However, it still uses its New Cross campus, where studios have since been refurbished.\n\n=== Literature ===\nIts library, New Cross Learning, which was formerly known as the New Cross People's Library, was saved from permanent closure after government cuts. A series of protests in 2011, namely from the \u2018Save New Cross Library Campaign\u2019 and the subsequent media coverage, garnered enough support to see it re-open in 2013 as a community led library. It now offers learning activities and workshops, and has a lending catalogue of over 5,000 books.\n\n==Demography==\nThe New Cross ward of Lewisham has the lowest female life expectancy of all the wards of Greater London: 77.6 years. For males the rate was 74.3 years, tied with Camberwell Green in Southwark and only higher than Selhurst ward in Croydon.<ref>https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Pimlott Building1.jpg|thumb|[[Ben Pimlott]] Building]]\n[[File:RISB.JPG|thumb|Goldsmith's Library]]\n\nThe proximity of New Cross to [[Deptford]] and [[Greenwich]], both of which have strong maritime connections, led to the establishment of the [[Royal Naval School]] in New Cross in 1843 (designed by architect [[John Shaw Jr]], 1803\u20131870) to house \"the sons of impecunious naval officers\". The school relocated further south-east to [[Mottingham]] in 1889, and the former school building was bought by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, who opened the Goldsmiths\u2019 Company's Technical and Recreative Institute in 1891. This was in turn handed over to the University of London in 1904 and is now [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].\n\nThe former Deptford Town Hall building in New Cross Road, now also used by Goldsmiths, was built in the [[Edwardian Baroque]] style by [[Henry Vaughan Lanchester|Lanchester]] and Rickards, 1903\u20135.

It opened as the New Cross Super Kinema in 1925, with a cinema on the ground floor and the New Cross Palais de Danse above, as well as a cafe. The name was shortened to New Cross Kinema from 1927, the plain Kinema in 1948, and finally Gaumont in 1950. It closed in August 1960, and remained derelict for some time. Part of the building was demolished before the old dancehall became The Harp Club and then The Venue in the late 1980s.\n\nAlso, the Duke of Albany [[public house]] (converted to flats in 2008) was the facade for The Winchester pub in the film ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.\n{{-}}\n\n==Transport==\n===Rail===\nThe area is served by two railway stations, [[New Cross railway station|New Cross]] and [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross Gate]].\n\nBoth stations are served by [[London Overground]].
