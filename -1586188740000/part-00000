lies on the opposite bank of the river, connected by the [[Natchez\u2013Vidalia Bridge]], carrying U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 65|65]], [[U.S. Route 84|84]], and [[U.S. Route 425|425]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.7|km2|disp=flip}}, all land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==History==\nVidalia was founded by [[Don Jos\u00e9 Vidal]], when He was secretary to Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, the Spanish Governor of the Natchez District from 1792\u20131797, before the United States acquired it in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. The Orleans Territorial legislature in 1811 changed the name of the city to Vidalia after its founder. Vidal had donated land along the river to the city, where its civic buildings were later constructed. He also donated land for the first school in Concordia Parish.\n\nThe Great Sandbar Duel, featuring [[Jim Bowie]] was a formal one-on-one duel that erupted into a violent brawl involving multiple combatants on September 19, 1827 and is one of the regional stories still told by local residents.\n\nOn July 14, 1863, shortly after the fall of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]-controlled Vidalia was entered by 200 mounted infantrymen led by [[Major (rank)|Major]] Asa Worden of the [[14th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. This detachment captured the rear of Confederate General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]'s [[Military logistics|ordnance]] train on the Trinity Road, {{convert|15|mi}} from the river. The Union forces took a large supply of muskets, cartridges, and ammunition.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 301</ref>\n\nThe longest-serving [[sheriff]] of Concordia Parish was Eugene P. Campbell, who held the position from 1908 until his death in February 1940. Another long-serving sheriff was [[Noah W. Cross]] of Ferriday, who was in office from 1944 to 1948, and 1952 to 1973. [[Fred L. Schiele]], a Vidalia native, was appointed and then elected sheriff from Cross' resignation until 1980.\n\nIn 1976, the former West and Company Department Store in Vidalia, owned by the late [[H. O. West]] of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], gained national attention when six female employees filed a [[civil rights]] suit claiming [[gender discrimination]] for the store's failure to promote women. They said they had been passed over for managerial promotions, although none had filed written applications for such positions. In its 1986 ruling, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in [[New Orleans]] ruled that the lack of written applications is no defense for companies in such matters, because the women had made verbal requests or may have feared retaliation for filing written records.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://openjurist.org/805/f2d/1171/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-west-brothers-department-store-of-mansfield-louisiana-inc| title=United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, New Orleans, October 23, 1986| publisher=openjurist.org| accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nVidalia is home to Louisiana's first [[hydroelectric power]] plant and the largest prefabricated power plant in the world.

The power plant began operation in 1990. The office is located on Texas Street in town.\n\n[[Hyram Copeland]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], had served as mayor of Vidalia from 1992 to 2016.

The park provides a way for residents to reconnect with the river, which was so important to its past as a riverport.\n\nVidalia leaders joined to partner in the creation of Municipal Park. With the City's purchase of 70+ acres, Concordia Recreation District #3 constructed a Sports Complex. Municipal Park is also home to the newly constructed City Hall, Police Station, and Fire Department.  In addition to municipal services and sports, the park accommodates the Dr. William T. Polk City Park and the Vidalia Community Garden.\n\nThrough a grant from the TDF Foundation, both Vidalia Landing Riverfront Park and Municipal Park, have free [[WiFi]] service. \n \nConcordia Parish is the northern gateway to the [[Atchafalaya Trace Heritage Area]], a culturally rich natural wonder encompassing 13 parishes in and around the [[Atchafalaya Basin]]. The lives and traditions of the people of this region are emphasized. The state of Louisiana and representatives from each of the thirteen member parishes are working to support projects that recognize this special heritage. A scenic byway will be part of the Atchafalaya Trace Heritage Area.\n\nThe Delta Museum, which is now housed in the former post office building in downtown [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], honors [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], journalist [[Howard K.

The museum, featuring six life-sized exhibits, is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.\n\nThe [[Frogmore (Ferriday, Louisiana)|Frogmore Plantation]] west of Vidalia is a {{convert|1,800|acre|ha|adj=on}} working historic cotton plantation.

lies on the opposite bank of the river, connected by the [[Natchez\u2013Vidalia Bridge]], carrying U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 65|65]], [[U.S. Route 84|84]], and [[U.S. Route 425|425]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.7|km2|disp=flip}}, all land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==History==\nVidalia was founded by [[Don Jos\u00e9 Vidal]], when He was secretary to Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, the Spanish Governor of the Natchez District from 1792-1797, before the United States acquired it in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. The Orleans Territorial legislature in 1811 changed the name of the city to Vidalia after its founder. Vidal had donated land along the river to the city, where its civic buildings were later constructed. He also donated land for the first school in Concordia Parish.\n\nThe Great Sandbar Duel, featuring [[Jim Bowie]] was a formal one-on-one duel that erupted into a violent brawl involving multiple combatants on September 19, 1827 and is one of the regional stories still told by local residents.\n\nOn July 14, 1863, shortly after the fall of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]]-controlled Vidalia was entered by 200 mounted infantrymen led by [[Major (rank)|Major]] Asa Worden of the [[14th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. This detachment captured the rear of Confederate General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]'s [[Military logistics|ordnance]] train on the Trinity Road, {{convert|15|mi}} from the river. The Union forces took a large supply of muskets, cartridges, and ammunition.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 301</ref>\n\nThe longest-serving [[sheriff]] of Concordia Parish was Eugene P. Campbell, who held the position from 1908 until his death in February 1940. Another long-serving sheriff was [[Noah W. Cross]] of Ferriday, who was in office from 1944 to 1948, and 1952 to 1973. [[Fred L. Schiele]], a Vidalia native, was appointed and then elected sheriff from Cross' resignation until 1980.\n\nIn 1976, the former West and Company Department Store in Vidalia, owned by the late [[H. O. West]] of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]], gained national attention when six female employees filed a [[civil rights]] suit claiming [[gender discrimination]] for the store's failure to promote women. They said they had been passed over for managerial promotions, although none had filed written applications for such positions. In its 1986 ruling, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] in [[New Orleans]] ruled that the lack of written applications is no defense for companies in such matters, because the women had made verbal requests or may have feared retaliation for filing written records.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://openjurist.org/805/f2d/1171/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-west-brothers-department-store-of-mansfield-louisiana-inc| title=United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, New Orleans, October 23, 1986| publisher=openjurist.org| accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nVidalia is home to Louisiana's first [[hydroelectric power]] plant and the largest prefabricated power plant in the world. A total of 41 countries and 21 states collaborated in this historic endeavor, the [[Sidney A. Murray, Jr. Hydroelectric Station]], located in the southern portion of Concordia Parish. The power plant began operation in 1990. The office is located on Texas Street in town.\n\n[[Hyram Copeland]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], had served as mayor of Vidalia from 1992 to 2016.

The park provides a way for residents to reconnect with the river, which was so important to its past as a riverport.\n\nVidalia leaders joined to partner in the creation of Municipal Park. With the City's purchase of 70+ acres, Concordia Recreation District #3 constructed a Sports Complex. Municipal Park is also home to the newly constructed City Hall, Police Station, and Fire Department.  In addition to municipal services and sports, the park accommodates the Dr. William T. Polk City Park and the Vidalia Community Garden.\n\nThrough a grant from the TDF Foundation, both Vidalia Landing Riverfront Park and Municipal Park, have free [[WiFi]] service. \n \nConcordia Parish is the northern gateway to the [[Atchafalaya Trace Heritage Area]], a culturally rich natural wonder encompassing 13 parishes in and around the [[Atchafalaya Basin]]. The lives and traditions of the people of this region are emphasized. The state of Louisiana and representatives from each of the thirteen member parishes are working to support projects that recognize this special heritage. A scenic byway will be part of the Atchafalaya Trace Heritage Area.\n\nThe Delta Museum, which is now housed in the former post office building in downtown [[Ferriday, Louisiana|Ferriday]], honors [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], journalist [[Howard K.

The shopping street in the pedestrian zone is within walking distance.\n \nDinslaken is only an intermediate stop on the line, but it is a major transport node. In addition to its role as a stop for trains from [[Oberhausen]] to [[Emmerich am Rhein]], the station also serves for interchange between trains and [[Trams in Duisburg|Duisburg trams]] (line 903) and is therefore also important for the neighbouring city of [[Duisburg]].\n \nThe districts in northern Duisburg such as Walsum or Fahrn have not been accessible by train since passenger services ended on the [[Oberhausen\u2013Wesel railway|Walsum Railway]]. There is no rail-based local transport in northern Duisburg except for trams since the main line runs via Oberhausen. Tram line 903 thus serves the connection between Duisburg and Dinslaken and is the feeder line to regional rail transport for people in northern Duisburg. Within Duisburg, line 903 is the main line on the north-south axis of the city of Duisburg and is the most powerful line in the entire ''Duisburger Verkehrsgesellschaft'' (municipal transport company) network.\n\n== History==\n[[File:Bahnhof Dinslaken 02 Bahnsteig.JPG|thumb|Former island platform on track 304 in 2015]]\nThe station was opened in 1 July 1856<ref name=\"operations\"/> by the [[Cologne-Minden Railway Company]] (''C\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', CME) when the first section of the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem line was opened to Dinslaken and it was the terminus of the line for a few months.\n\nThe section between Dinslaken and [[Emmerich station|Emmerich]] went into operation on 20&nbsp;October 1856, completing the line between Oberhausen and [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Rolf|last= Swoboda |title=Venloer Bahn.

The station is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\n== Location and importance ==\nThe station is located at line-km&nbsp;13.9 of the [[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]] ([[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof|Oberhausen&nbsp;Hbf]]\u2013[[Emmerich station|Emmerich]]\u2013[[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]]). It has six mainline tracks, of which tracks 301 and 302 are the main through tracks. The station has a 325&nbsp;metre-long and 76&nbsp;centimetres-high island platform (tracks&nbsp;301/302),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=1223&c2235748=Dinslaken&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |title=Platform information.

Tracks 305 to 307 are sidings. The station precincts are managed by [[DB Station&Service]], which categorised it as a [[German railway station categories|class]]&nbsp;3 station.<ref name =categories/>\n \nThe tracks have been remotely controlled from the Emmerich [[Computer-based interlocking|computer based interlocking]] since June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|first=Andr\u00e9 |last=Joost |url=http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/stwesn/EDIN-ESTW-A.htm |title=Signal box: Dinslaken ESTW-A |work=NRW rail archive |language=de | accessdate= 6 April 2020}}</ref> The previously responsible [[relay interlocking]]&nbsp;\"Dif\" (class SpDrS60) built in 1975 was abandoned at its opening.

The shopping street in the pedestrian zone is within walking distance.\n \nDinslaken is only an intermediate stop on the line, but it is a major transport node. In addition to its role as a stop for trains from [[Oberhausen]] to [[Emmerich am Rhein]], the station also serves for interchange between trains and [[Trams in Duisburg|Duisburg trams]] (line 903) and is therefore also important for the neighbouring city of [[Duisburg]].\n \nThe districts in northern Duisburg such as Walsum or Fahrn have not been accessible by train since passenger services ended on the [[Oberhausen\u2013Wesel railway|Walsum Railway]]. There is no rail-based local transport in northern Duisburg except for trams since the main line runs via Oberhausen. Tram line 903 thus serves the connection between Duisburg and Dinslaken and is the feeder line to regional rail transport for people in northern Duisburg. Within Duisburg, line 903 is the main line on the north-south axis of the city of Duisburg and is the most powerful line in the entire ''Duisburger Verkehrsgesellschaft'' (municipal transport company) network.\n\n== History==\n[[File:Bahnhof Dinslaken 02 Bahnsteig.JPG|thumb|Former island platform on track 304 in 2015]]\nThe station was opened in 1 July 1856<ref name=\"operations\"/> by the [[Cologne-Minden Railway Company]] (''C\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', CME) when the first section of the the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem line was opened to Dinslaken and it was the terminus of the line for a few months.\n\nThe section between Dinslaken and [[Emmerich station|Emmerich]] went into operation on 20&nbsp;October 1856, completing the line between Oberhausen and [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Rolf|last= Swoboda |title=Venloer Bahn.

Ethiopia, in its speech, stated that, in regards to security in the Horn of Africa region, that Eritrea had played a destructive role since its independence.

The Delegation continued by stating that Ethiopia was using Eritrea as a scapegoat for the problems it had created Somalia. It further pointed out that it was Ethiopia\u2019s campaign in Somalia in 2006 that contributed to the rise of the Al-Shabaab, and not Eritrean support as Ethiopia claimed. Finally, it stated that Ethiopia had created one of the biggest humanitarian crises African had ever seen and that Ethiopia had significantly contributed to the destabilization of the Somalia. Eritrea finished by calling on Ethiopia to end its occupation of Eritrean territories in order to ensure stability in the region. \n<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to respond to Eritrea's Right of Reply.

The Delegation further stated that despite Eritrea's role in the destabilization of the region, and the passage of UNSC Resolution 1907, that the international community had failed to take tangible measures to stop Eritrea. Ethiopia then accused the Eritrean regime of waging a campaign to deflect attention from itself by bringing up the border dispute between the two states, and making Eritrea out to be an \"underdog.\" Finally, it finished by calling upon the international community to exert more pressure on Eritrea to comply with UNSC Resolution 1907.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Pakistan''' <br>\nPakistan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by India in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. India, in its speech, stated that, [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] was is an integral part of India, and that it had been the target of Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism. India called upon Pakistan to fulfill its commitment to not to allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India. India finished by stating that Pakistan could not impart lessons  on democracy and human rights to the international community as long as it continued to allow terrorism against India to remain unchecked.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_IN_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E. Mr. S. M.

It also mentioned that the United Nations had adopted more than a dozen resolutions calling for the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite. Pakistan then reminded India that its first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], had said in a speech on 2 January 1952 that \"Kashmir is not the property of either India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people. When Kashmir acceded to India, we made it clear\nto the leaders of the Kashmiri people that we would ultimately abide by the verdict of their plebiscite.\" Pakistan stated that India had continued to violate several United Nations resolutions, and failed to fulfill the commitments made by its leaders.\n\nPakistan then stated that India had used their speech to distract the international community from their human rights violations of Kashmiris in Indian-occupied Kashmir. It brought up statements by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] which both had called on the Indian authorities to take steps to ensure respect for the right to life of Kashmiri demonstrators, as well as to respect the [[United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials]]. Finally, Pakistan accused India of maligning Pakistan on the issue of terrorism in order to conceal the state terrorism it had been using to stifle Kashmiri voices demanding the right to self-determination.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Armenia in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Armenia, in its speech, stated that Azerbaijan was a threat to regional peace and security through its continued denial of the right to self-determination by the people of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] by rejecting the [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|1991 independence referendum]]. Armenia continued by accusing Azerbaijan of attempting to cleanse the people of Nagorno-Karabakh from their ancestral home via a brutal war. Azerbaijan was then accused of undermining the peace process by misleading the international community by distorting of the nature of the conflict, by undermining the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] by rejecting its proposed principles and by rejecting proposals to come to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat of force. Armenia finished by condemning Azerbaijan's destruction of thousands of cultural and religious heritage objects in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_AM_en_fr_0.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

It further accused Armenia of unleashing the war, attacking Azerbaijan, occupying its ancestral territories, carrying out ethnic cleansing and establishing a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. Azerbaijan also called into the question the legitimacy of the 1991 referendum, claiming that it was not recognized by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Finally, it called on Armenia to realize that in order for peace to be achieved, there was no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Armenia''' <br>\nArmenia used its Right of Reply to respond to Azerbaijan's Right of Reply. It replied by stating that claims of any military expansionism by Armenia made by Azerbaijan were totally misleading; asserting that Armenia had never started any aggression whatsoever. Armenia continued by pinning the full blame of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on Azerbaijan, accusing them of starting a full-scale war against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. Finally, it finished by stating that Armenia had fully complied with the [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|various Security Council resolutions]] concerning the conflict, whereas Azerbaijan had not, and was attempting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe Republic of Korea (ROK) used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. The DPRK, in its speech, stated that, its efforts towards peaceful development were being constantly threatened and undermined. It then commented on the situation regarding the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|''Cheonan'' incident]], and how sabre-rattling and arms build-ups by the United States and the ROK were leading the Korean peninsula to brink of war. It further rejected the findings of the international team that was assembled to investigate the sinking, citing the ROK's refusal to allow a team from the DPRK to investigate the incident for scientific and objective verification. Finally, the DPRK castigated the ROK, accusing them of rejecting reunification efforts by creating tension on the Korean peninsula by waging war exercises with outside forces and by stepping up an atmosphere of war against their fellow countrymen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_KP_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

Finally, it refuted the DPRK's claims that it was a nuclear-weapon state, citing reports of the [[2010 NPT Review Conference|eighth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference]].<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/><ref>{{UN doc |docid=S/PRST/2010/13 |body=S |session=64 |type=PRST |resolution_number=13 |title=Statement by the President of the Security Council |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate= 27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Eritrea''' <br>\nEritrea used its Right of Reply to respond to Ethiopia's Right of Reply. It stated that the key to resolving the problems between Eritrea and Ethiopia was the withdrawal of Ethiopian soldiers and institutions from Eritrean sovereign territories. It then mentioned that the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission had already delimited and demarcated the border, and that Ethiopia\u2019s dishonoring of the Commission's agreement by refusing to withdrawal its soldiers was irresponsible and shameful. Finally, it reminded the General Assembly that Ethiopia continues to be the only constant factor throughout the political crisis in Somalia, and that Ethiopia\u2019s continued meddling in the affairs of Somalia was dangerous to Somalis and to the rest of the region.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''India''' <br>\nIndia used its Right of Reply to respond to Pakistan's Right of Reply. India responded by stating that in its speech, Pakistan had made various baseless and false allegations against India. It continued by reminding Pakistan that it should concentrate on addressing the enormous challenges confronting it, such as terrorism, extremism and sectarianism, rather than making unsolicited remarks about the internal affairs of other states in an attempt to divert attention. Finally, it finished by stating that the [[Indian Constitution]] guaranteed the fundamental rights of all Indians, including those in Jammu and Kashmir, and that, contrary to claims made by Pakistan, free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir had been regularly held allowing people in the region to exercised their right to franchise in order to elect their representatives.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to Armenia's Right of Reply. It stated the United Nations should only be resorted to by\nMember States in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Organization and not misused for political advantage. It then accused Armenia of using the Organization to advocate for a culture of impunity and promote dangerous ideas of racial, ethnic and religious superiority. It further asserted that it considered Armenia's behavior an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and a threat to international and regional peace and security. Finally, it asked for the international communities help to persuade Armenia to cease its destructive policies, respect the generally accepted norms and principles of international law and negotiate in good faith with a view to achieving a durable solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe DPRK used its Right of Reply to respond to ROK's Right of Reply. It stated the ROK, in regards to the sinking of the ''Cheonan'' incident, was attempting to bring to the attention of the General Assembly an issue which not even the Security Council had prepared an appropriate judgement.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\nIt continued by reiterating that the DPRK had nothing to do with the sinking, and that the evidence presented by the ROK in the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group was not scientifically based or objective, and that it did nothing more but to raise conclusive doubts. It then mentioned that the ROK had rejected its offer to dispatch its own inspection group in order to verify the investigation's results objectively and scientifically, instead insisting that the international community should only accept the ROK's investigation results. It then stated that if the ROK had nothing to hide, then there was no reason for them not to accept the DPRK's inspection group to verify the investigation results, and that as long as the ROK refused to accept the inspection group, suspicion would continue to grow.\n\nFinally, it stated that it did not need the ROK, or any country, to recognize or accept the status of the DPRK as a nuclear State, and that their nuclear program was no created in order to intimidate, but rather as a means to deter attacks from the outside.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to touch upon the situation with Eritrea. It stated that both Ethiopia and Eritrea had expressed their views on the topic, and that they both had been throwing accusations and allegations at each other for almost a decade, to no avail. It continued by talking about the situation in Somalia and called upon members of the Assembly to refer to the outcome of the Summit on Somalia convened by Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], which imposed sanction on Eritrea, and not Ethiopia. It then talked about how the African Union and the international community had both sanctioned Eritrea, stating that it would be unlikely that they had got it all wrong and that Eritrea had got it right. With regards to demarcation, Ethiopia stated that the only way forward was through dialogue.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Pakistan''' <br>\nPakistan used to Right of Reply to respond to India's Right of Reply. It started by stating that India's arguments regarding elections in Indian-occupied Kashmir had been rejected by both the people of the region, as well as by the international community.

Sweden, in its speech, called upon the international community to uphold human rights as enshrined in the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. One of the rights specifically mentioned was the freedom of expression, and how it must be protected even in the era of information technology.

The Delegation continued by stating that Ethiopia was using Eritrea as a scapegoat for the problems it had created Somalia. It further pointed out that it was Ethiopia\u2019s campaign in Somalia in 2006 that contributed to the rise of the Al-Shabaab, and not Eritrean support as Ethiopia claimed. Finally, it stated that Ethiopia had created one of the biggest humanitarian crises African had ever seen and that Ethiopia had significantly contributed to the destabilization of the Somalia. Eritrea finished by calling on Ethiopia to end its occupation of Eritrean territories in order to ensure stability in the region. \n<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to respond to Eritrea's Right of Reply.

The Delegation further stated that despite Eritrea's role in the destabilization of the region, and the passage of UNSC Resolution 1907, that the international community had failed to take tangible measures to stop Eritrea. Ethiopia then accused the Eritrean regime of waging a campaign to deflect attention from itself by bringing up the border dispute between the two states, and making Eritrea out to be an \"underdog.\" Finally, it finished by calling upon the international community to exert more pressure on Eritrea to comply with UNSC Resolution 1907.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Pakistan''' <br>\nPakistan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by India in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. India, in its speech, stated that, [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] was is an integral part of India, and that it had been the target of Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism. India called upon Pakistan to fulfill its commitment to not to allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India. India finished by stating that Pakistan could not impart lessons  on democracy and human rights to the international community as long as it continued to allow terrorism against India to remain unchecked.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_IN_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

It also mentioned that the United Nations had adopted more than a dozen resolutions calling for the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite. Pakistan then reminded India that its first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], had said in a speech on 2 January 1952 that \"Kashmir is not the property of either India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people. When Kashmir acceded to India, we made it clear\nto the leaders of the Kashmiri people that we would ultimately abide by the verdict of their plebiscite.\" Pakistan stated that India had continued to violate several United Nations resolutions, and failed to fulfill the commitments made by its leaders.\n\nPakistan then stated that India had used their speech to distract the international community from their human rights violations of Kashmiris in Indian-occupied Kashmir. It brought up statements by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] which both had called on the Indian authorities to take steps to ensure respect for the right to life of Kashmiri demonstrators, as well as to respect the [[United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials]]. Finally, Pakistan accused India of maligning Pakistan on the issue of terrorism in order to conceal the state terrorism it had been using to stifle Kashmiri voices demanding the right to self-determination.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Armenia in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Armenia, in its speech, stated that Azerbaijan was a threat to regional peace and security through its continued denial of the right to self-determination by the people of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] by rejecting the [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|1991 independence referendum]]. Armenia continued by accusing Azerbaijan of attempting to cleanse the people of Nagorno-Karabakh from their ancestral home via a brutal war. Azerbaijan was then accused of undermining the peace process by misleading the international community by distorting of the nature of the conflict, by undermining the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] by rejecting its proposed principles and by rejecting proposals to come to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat of force. Armenia finished by condemning Azerbaijan's destruction of thousands of cultural and religious heritage objects in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_AM_en_fr_0.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

It further accused Armenia of unleashing the war, attacking Azerbaijan, occupying its ancestral territories, carrying out ethnic cleansing and establishing a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. Azerbaijan also called into the question the legitimacy of the 1991 referendum, claiming that it was not recognized by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Finally, it called on Armenia to realize that in order for peace to be achieved, there was no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Armenia''' <br>\nArmenia used its Right of Reply to respond to Azerbaijan's Right of Reply. It replied by stating that claims of any military expansionism by Armenia made by Azerbaijan were totally misleading; asserting that Armenia had never started any aggression whatsoever. Armenia continued by pinning the full blame of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on Azerbaijan, accusing them of starting a full-scale war against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. Finally, it finished by stating that Armenia had fully complied with the [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|various Security Council resolutions]] concerning the conflict, whereas Azerbaijan had not, and was attempting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe Republic of Korea (ROK) used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. The DPRK, in its speech, stated that, its efforts towards peaceful development were being constantly threatened and undermined. It then commented on the situation regarding the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|''Cheonan'' incident]], and how sabre-rattling and arms build-ups by the United States and the ROK were leading the Korean peninsula to brink of war. It further rejected the findings of the international team that was assembled to investigate the sinking, citing the ROK's refusal to allow a team from the DPRK to investigate the incident for scientific and objective verification. Finally, the DPRK castigated the ROK, accusing them of rejecting reunification efforts by creating tension on the Korean peninsula by waging war exercises with outside forces and by stepping up an atmosphere of war against their fellow countrymen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_KP_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

Finally, it refuted the DPRK's claims that it was a nuclear-weapon state, citing reports of the [[2010 NPT Review Conference|eighth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference]].<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/><ref>{{UN doc |docid=S/PRST/2010/13 |body=S |session=64 |type=PRST |resolution_number=13 |title=Statement by the President of the Security Council |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate= 27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Eritrea''' <br>\nEritrea used its Right of Reply to respond to Ethiopia's Right of Reply. It stated that the key to resolving the problems between Eritrea and Ethiopia was the withdrawal of Ethiopian soldiers and institutions from Eritrean sovereign territories. It then mentioned that the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission had already delimited and demarcated the border, and that Ethiopia\u2019s dishonoring of the Commission's agreement by refusing to withdrawal its soldiers was irresponsible and shameful. Finally, it reminded the General Assembly that Ethiopia continues to be the only constant factor throughout the political crisis in Somalia, and that Ethiopia\u2019s continued meddling in the affairs of Somalia was dangerous to Somalis and to the rest of the region.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''India''' <br>\nIndia used its Right of Reply to respond to Pakistan's Right of Reply. India responded by stating that in its speech, Pakistan had made various baseless and false allegations against India. It continued by reminding Pakistan that it should concentrate on addressing the enormous challenges confronting it, such as terrorism, extremism and sectarianism, rather than making unsolicited remarks about the internal affairs of other states in an attempt to divert attention. Finally, it finished by stating that the [[Indian Constitution]] guaranteed the fundamental rights of all Indians, including those in Jammu and Kashmir, and that, contrary to claims made by Pakistan, free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir had been regularly held allowing people in the region to exercised their right to franchise in order to elect their representatives.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to Armenia's Right of Reply. It stated the United Nations should only be resorted to by\nMember States in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Organization and not misused for political advantage. It then accused Armenia of using the Organization to advocate for a culture of impunity and promote dangerous ideas of racial, ethnic and religious superiority. It further asserted that it considered Armenia's behavior an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and a threat to international and regional peace and security. Finally, it asked for the international communities help to persuade Armenia to cease its destructive policies, respect the generally accepted norms and principles of international law and negotiate in good faith with a view to achieving a durable solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe DPRK used its Right of Reply to respond to ROK's Right of Reply. It stated the ROK, in regards to the sinking of the ''Cheonan'' incident, was attempting to bring to the attention of the General Assembly an issue which not even the Security Council had prepared an appropriate judgement.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\nIt continued by reiterating that the DPRK had nothing to do with the sinking, and that the evidence presented by the ROK in the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group was not scientifically based or objective, and that it did nothing more but to raise conclusive doubts. It then mentioned that the ROK had rejected its offer to dispatch its own inspection group in order to verify the investigation's results objectively and scientifically, instead insisting that the international community should only accept the ROK's investigation results. It then stated that if the ROK had nothing to hide, then there was no reason for them not to accept the DPRK's inspection group to verify the investigation results, and that as long as the ROK refused to accept the inspection group, suspicion would continue to grow.\n\nFinally, it stated that it did not need the ROK, or any country, to recognize or accept the status of the DPRK as a nuclear State, and that their nuclear program was no created in order to intimidate, but rather as a means to deter attacks from the outside.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to touch upon the situation with Eritrea. It stated that both Ethiopia and Eritrea had expressed their views on the topic, and that they both had been throwing accusations and allegations at each other for almost a decade, to no avail. It continued by talking about the situation in Somalia and called upon members of the Assembly to refer to the outcome of the Summit on Somalia convened by Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], which imposed sanction on Eritrea, and not Ethiopia. It then talked about how the African Union and the international community had both sanctioned Eritrea, stating that it would be unlikely that they had got it all wrong and that Eritrea had got it right. With regards to demarcation, Ethiopia stated that the only way forward was through dialogue.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Pakistan''' <br>\nPakistan used to Right of Reply to respond to India's Right of Reply. It started by stating that India's arguments regarding elections in Indian-occupied Kashmir had been rejected by both the people of the region, as well as by the international community. It then stated that Pakistan did not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and that the Jammu and Kashmir issue was not an internal Indian matter. It continued by stating that due to the fact that Pakistan was a stakeholder in the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, it retained the right to raise this issue in all international forums, saying it would continue to support the people of Jammu and Kashmir morally, politically and diplomatically.\n\nPakistan then continued by stating that despite decades of repression and human rights violations at the hands of Indian forces, the people of Jammu and Kashmir refused to accept any solution other than the exercise of their right to self-determination. It then stated that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir should not be used as a tool of State politics. Finally, it finished by stating that Pakistan remained committed to a peaceful resolution of all issues with India, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Armenia''' <br>\nArmenia used to Right of Reply to respond to its situation with Azerbaijan. It started by stating that its previous statement were intended to sincerely address the burning issues of the people of the region. It continued by stating that its previous statement applied to all national and ethnic groups living in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Finally, it stated that the comments by Azerbaijan were politically motivated, and in no way served the goals of the Assembly, which are aimed at uniting all nations.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''India''' <br>\nIndia used to Right of Reply to reject all untenable and unsolicited remarks from Pakistan.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Viet Nam''' <br>\nViet Nam used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Sweden in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Sweden, in its speech, stated that the harassment and jailing of journalists and bloggers in various countries, including Viet Nam, had to stop. It also called upon the international community to to addresses the issue of the violation of freedom of expression in the digital age.<ref name=\"SWEDEN\"/>\n\nViet Nam responded by stating that it was open to all comments concerning the country, as long as these comments were constructive and well-informed. It continued by stating that Sweden's comments about the jailing and harassment of journalists in Viet Nam, however, were uninformed, misinformed and ungrounded. Finally it stated that these comments were contrary to the tradition of friendship\nbetween the two countries on the basis of mutual respect and respect for international law.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.un.org/en/ga/65/ 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly]\n* [https://gadebate.un.org/en/sessions-archive/65 General Debate of the 65th Session]\n\n{{United Nations General Assembly General Debates}}\n\n[[Category:General debates of United Nations General Assembly|65]]\n[[Category:2010 in international relations]]\n[[Category:2010 in New York City]]\n[[Category:2010 politics in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:September 2010 events]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_debate_of_the_sixty-fifth_session_of_the_United_Nations_General_Assembly"}

There was a suspicion that Gaspar da Gama was an Arabic spy, but the Portuguese recognized his value, because beside having traded in some of their centers in India, he spoke [[Latin]], [[Arabic]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some languages of India. Because of this, the King Manuel I appointed him counselor and interpreter of the second fleet sailing to the Indies, led by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].<ref name=\"cordeiro\"/>\n\nAlways with a cap on his head and dressed in white linen, Gaspar da Gama was one of the more exotic characters in the fleet of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.<ref name=\"lipener\"/> Although not the only linguist at the expedition that discovered the Brazil, he was the main interpreter in the trade negotiations between the Portuguese and Brazilian Indians, along with Gon\u00e7alo Madeira. Once in India, Gaspar da Gama fulfilled his mission with his interpreter services and knowledge of geopolitics and customs of India important in business meetings of Portuguese and Indian rajas in Calicut and Cochin.\n\nHe returned on his own will to Portugal with Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral. In 1501, the fleet met the expedition of [[Gaspar de Lemos]] appointed by the king of Portugal to explore the newly discovered lands of Brazil, near modern Dakar, Senegal. Talks between Gaspar da Gama and other members of the expedition with the Florentine [[Amerigo Vespucci]] who accompanied Gaspar de Lemos certainly strengthened the idea that the lands discovered by Christopher Columbus were not the Indies, but a new continent.\n\nIn 1502 Gaspar da Gama participated in another travel to India commanded by Vasco da Gama, and again in 1505 with the recently appointed viceroy [[Francisco de Almeida]]. During these trips, he learned a few African languages.\n\nHe participated in the Indian expeditions of the Portuguese who tried to conquer Hormuz in 1508 and Calicut in 1510, when some assume that he died. Others believe that he returned to Portugal where he died. Some say that his death occurred between 1510 and 1515, or even by about 1520, with nearly eighty years. The change of Christian name \"[[Terra de Santa Cruz]]\" to \"Brazil\" is attributed by some to Gaspar da Gama and [[Fern\u00e3o de Noronha]], both being Jewish. However, this does not have an historical basis, being due to the intense trade in [[Brazilwood]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gaspar Da Gama}}\n[[Category:Portuguese exploration in the Age of Discovery]]\n[[Category:Interpreters]]\n[[Category:Polish Jews]]\n[[Category:1444 births]]\n[[Category:1510s deaths]]\n[[Category:History of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Maritime history of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Medieval Polish Jews]]\n[[Category:15th-century Jews]]\n[[Category:16th-century Jews]]\n", "text_old": "'''Gaspar da Gama''' also known as '''Gaspar da India''' and '''Gaspar de Almeida''' (c. 1444 \u2013 c. 1510) was a traveler of [[Jewish]] origin who was probably born in in [[Pozna\u0144]] in the Kingdom of Poland.

Some sources confuse the latest with [[Gaspar de Lemos]], a Portuguese sailor who commanded a ship in the fleet that discovered Brazil.

According to Gaspar's own account, he became a Jewish traveller, making his way to [[Jerusalem]], and then [[Alexandria]], where he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave in India, in India he secured his freedom in the service of the ruler of [[Goa]].<ref name=\"JVL1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/gaspar-da-gama|title=Gaspar da Gama|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|location=Chevy Chase, Maryland|page=|language=|trans-title=|isbn=|volume=}}</ref> The [[chronicler]] Gaspar Correia states that, when found by the Portuguese, Gaspar da Gama was Captain of the fleet of [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], the [[Bijapur Sultanate|Sultan of Bijapur]], Arab governor of [[Goa]] in India.<ref name=\"cordeiro\"/> Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is says Gaspar da Gama was a Jew born in the city of [[Pozna\u0144]] in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and that at that time he did not speak Spanish, but the [[Venetian language]],<ref name=\"magno\"/> the very language used in European based commercial centers in the East.\n\n===Controversy===\nThe historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], reports that Gaspar da Gama informed him that his parents were from Bosna (or Posner, i.e., Poznan) in Poland. His parents migrated to [[Jerusalem]] and then to [[Alexandria]], where Gaspar da Gama was born. The Israeli journalist Elias Lipiner, studied the documentation of the Portuguese chroniclers of the [[Age of Discovery]] and considered Jo\u00e3o de Barros version as the most faithful to facts, suggesting that Gaspar da Gama must have been born in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt) around 1458.<ref name=\"cordeiro\"/> Following [[Radhanite|Jewish Radhanite trade routes]] at the time, he went very young to India where he established himself as a merchant. Other historians, such as the scholar of Brazilian Jewish history Arnold Wiznitzer, think he was born in [[Granada]] or circa 1440 in Bosnia (perhaps confusion with the name of Poznan).\n\n=== Meeting the Portuguese ===\nIn 1498, when the returning Vasco da Gama fleet landed on the [[Anjadip Island|island of Angediva]], about 20 miles off the coast of Goa, Gaspar da Gama, uninvited, went on the ship of Vasco da Gama and asked happily to go aboard, to visit his native Spain.<ref name=\"magno\">[http://www2.correioweb.com.br/hotsites/500anos/portugal-brasil/dia29/dia29-1.htm MAGNO, Ana Beatriz.
