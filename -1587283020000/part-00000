Her father, who worked as a painter and decorator, became involved in a fight when she was three, defending his wife.   The man whom he hit was an off-duty [[Volkspolizei|policeman]].   Klier's father spent the next twelve months in prison while her mother was switched to night shift work.   Freya and her four-year-old brother were sent to a state orphanage.   The family were reunited a year later, but the children were from this point marked out as the children of political prisoners, a stigma that affected them adversely until the [[German Democratic Republic|East German dictatorship]] finally [[East German general election, 1990|crumbled into history]] in [[German reunification|1990]].<ref name=FKlautISK>{{cite web|title=Freya Klier, geboren 1950|work= Biographisches Lexikon: Widerstand und Opposition im Kommunismus 1945-91|url=https://dissidenten.eu/laender/deutschland-ddr/biografien/freya-klier/freya-klier-teil-1/|author=Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk| date=September 2016 |publisher=Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=23 August 2017|author-link= Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 her brother, at the time barely seventeen years old, was accused of \"slandering the state\" and sentenced to a four-year jail term, following which she resolved to emigrate.   As a result of the slaughter of [[Second World War|war]] in the 1940s and [[Republikflucht|massive emigration]] in the 1950s East Germany was desperately short of working-age population.   By 1966 leaving the country - even temporarily - was for most people \"against the rules\" and impossible.   Freya Klier nevertheless devised a plan to escape with an acquaintance from a Swedish theatre group, armed with a false passport and travelling aboard a [[Sweden|Swedish]] merchant ship.<ref name=FKlautHohensch>{{cite web|title=Freya Klier|work=Biographies |url= http://www.stiftung-hsh.de/history/stasi-prison/biographies/the-eighties/freya-klier-en-gb/|publisher=[[Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial|Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial (Gedenkst\u00e4tte Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen)]]|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>  Shortly before the ship was due to sail, in July 1966, she was betrayed and arrested.   She was sentenced \"for attempting to flee the Republic\" (''wegen \"versuchter Republikflucht\"'')<ref name=FKlautwww/> to a sixteen-month jail term but served only twelve months, after which the four month balance was [[Suspended sentence|\"suspended\"]] for two years.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== After school ===\nIn 1968 she passed her [[Abitur|school final exams (''\"Abitur\"'')]] which under other circumstances would have opened the way to a university-level education, at the same time, due to the subjects studied, earning a diploma in mechanical draftsmanship.   Her school years had involved a \"twin-track\" path, which for her generation was not unusual.   Although she was a member of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]]-backed [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], outside school she was also participating in religious studies.   Later, despite her membership of the [[Free German Youth|party's youth wing (FDJ)]], she was also involved with the church-sponsored [[Katholische Junge Gemeinde|\"Young Community\"]].<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Once she had finished with school and prison she undertook various low status jobs including waitressing and post office work.<ref name=FKlautwww/>   She also took \"behind the scenes\" work with the Dresden Puppet Theatre.<ref name=FKlautFK>{{cite web|url=http://www.freya-klier.de/homepage/bio.html|title=Biographie |author=Freya Klier|work=Mein elftes Gebot: \"Du sollst Dich erinnern!\"|accessdate= 23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre career ===\nIn 1970, thanks to the intervention of a [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Party]] Secretary, Klier was able to embark on a study course at the [[Theaterhochschule Leipzig|Theatre Academy]] in [[Leipzig]], emerging with a degree in 1975.<ref name=FKlautISK/>  Next she received a contract at the [[:de:Neue B\u00fchne Senftenberg|Neue B\u00fchne (theatre)]] in [[Senftenberg]], a small town in the flat countryside north of Dresden, where she worked as an actress.   Alongside the acting she also became increasingly interested in directing.   That led to a four-year period of study at the Berlin Institute for Theater direction, for which she received her diploma in 1982.<ref name=FKlautISK/>   During the early 1980s she worked on productions of works by [[Fernando Arrabal]] (at [[Halle an der Saale|Halle]]), [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]] (at [[Bautzen]]), Carl Sternberg and [[John Millington Synge]] (both at [[Berlin]]).<ref name=FKlautFK/>\n\nIn the 1970s Klier developed a growing interest in the cultural scene in [[Poland]].   That led her, almost unavoidably, to become increasingly critical of the reality of the communist states in central Europe.  She tried to present her criticisms both politically and through her artistic work.   The East German authorities were never receptive to criticism, however finely it might or might not be nuanced.   Accordingly, at this time most of Klier's theatrical productions in East Germany were met with official suspicion or open criticism from the many channels employed by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]].  Most of her productions found themselves rapidly cancelled or reconfigured (''\"uminszeniert\"''), so that relatively little survives of her own work.   She was, necessarily, a member of the official \"East German Theatrical Union\" (''\"Theaterverband der DDR\"''), but found herself prevented from accepting invitations to work in theatres abroad - for instance in [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]].   Sources attribute this to the critical stance detected in much of her theatre work and to her involvement, from 1981, in the church-backed [[:de:Friedensbewegung#In der DDR|peace movement]].<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Nevertheless, in 1984 she received a director's prize for the premier of \"Legende vom Gl\u00fcck ohne Ende\" (''\"Legends of Endless Joy\"'') by [[Ulrich Plenzdorf]] at the [[:de:Uckerm\u00e4rkische B\u00fchnen Schwedt|Schwedt Theatre]] where she was working between 1982 and 1984.   Despite, or possibly because of this accolade, she left the theatre that year, and in 1985, after resigning her [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership in April, she was served with a ban on further professional work.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Beyond theatre ===\nKlier became increasingly involved with the [[:de:Friedenskreis Pankow|Pankow Peace Circle]] in East Berlin during the early 1980s.   The Pankow circle was, for many years, one of the more active and high-profile (but still localised) opposition groups cautiously emerging at the time.   She was nevertheless internally conflicted because of her professional goals, and tried to integrate her artistic ambitions and her political goals.   That was not always easy.   In July 1981 she staged a small production for a church peace festival despite the threat of exclusion from the Institute for Theater direction (at which she was studying).<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Her preference for true facts also made the authorities nervous.   In order to provide a factual basis for the social critique incorporated in and promoted by her artistic work, in 1983 Freya Klier began to make systematic enquiries of women with children about their home lives.   She had herself been a single mother since the birth of Nadja, her daughter, in 1973:  she knew from personal experience that there was a stark contrast between official propaganda and the actual condition of women in society.   But her questionnaire based approach threatened a national taboo.   Sociological or demographic studies were to be undertaken only by a small number of researchers who enjoyed the confidence of [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]].   Otherwise there was an ever-present danger that \"right theory\" might be undermined by \"false empiricism\".<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Stephan Krawczyk ===\nIn February 1984 Klier met the songwriter [[Stephan Krawczyk]].   At the start of the 1980s he was a member of the still younger generation of artists whom the authorities confidently saw as the great hope for the nation's artistic future.   He had won first prize at the 1981 [[:de:Chansontage der DDR|National Song Festival]] and was, naturally, a [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] member.   It was only in April 1985 that he resigned his party membership\".<ref name=FKlautISK/><ref name=SKlautwww>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=1894|title=Krawczyk, Stephan * 31.12.1955 Liedermacher, Schriftsteller, Dissident|author=Silvia M\u00fcller| publisher=Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>   Krawczyk had by this time become something of an iconic figure, especially for younger East German fans:  later in 1985 he and Klier were both served with what amounted to a nationwide ban on professional work (''Berufsverbot''), which was linked with exclusion from the national \"Theatrical Union\" (''\"Theaterverband\"'').   The authorities, with a characteristic absence of subtelty, sought to destroy Krawczyk's fan base, describing him as a \"national enemy\" (''\"Staatsfeind\"'') and even as the \"new [[Wolf Biermann]]\".<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Opposing dictatorship ===\nOver the next twelve months the two of them worked together on a programme of dramatic pieces and prose readings critical of the \"socialist\" society.<ref name=FKlautwww/>    These received supportive responses from audiences of church groups and in community halls.   The authorities responded by pressuring the church authorities to block their appearances.   But as matters turned out there were more and more churches and community groups that continued to provide them with venues for their presentations.   Klier and Krawczyk (who married in 1986) also found themselves deluged with official ordinances and injunctions.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\nDuring 1985, believing that she had identified the roots of the country's dictatorship in its education system, Klier began a new questionnaire-based research project into the East German education and training system.   She conducted structured interviews with young people and, from 1986, with teachers, revealing a picture of a society riddled with dishonesty, depression and hopelessness.   At the same time she found that the limits of the state's ideological power to influence had been reached, and that most young people  of the 80s generation - if only inwardly - resisted [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party's]] preposterous claims for the society over which it presided.   Klier's researches were written up and presented early in 1990 in her book \"L\u00fcg Vaterland. Erziehung in der DDR\" (''loosely: \"Lie, Fatherland: Education in East Germany\"''), the publication of which excited much attention during a critical year in East German history.<ref name=FKlautISK/><ref name=FKlautKAS>{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_8879-1442-1-30.pdf?130207124520|title=Freya Klier ...

The [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (''Stasi'')]] subjected them both to a programme of intense monitoring, identified in their files as \"Operation Sinus\" (''\"OV Sinus\"'').   As a result of Stasi interventions it became increasingly difficult to organise presentations.   Their car was tampered with several times:  on at least one occasion the brake cable on one side was cut.  Krawczyk experience a nerve gas attack as he was opening the car door.<ref name=FKlautPV>{{cite web|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/freiburg/zeitzeugen-lassen-sich-nicht-ersetzen--56661689.html|title=Zeitzeugen lassen sich nicht ersetzen|work=Die DDR-B\u00fcrgerrechtlerin und Schriftstellerin Freya Klier erz\u00e4hlte am Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium von ihrem Leben im Widerstand. |date=7 March 2012| author=Petra V\u00f6lzing|publisher=Badischer Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nevertheless, unlike her sixteen year old self, Freya Klier was now determined to stay the course and not to abandon East Germany.<ref name=FKlautISK/><ref name=FKlautKAS/>\n\nIn October 1986 Klier was a co-founder of the [[:de:Arbeitskreis Solidarische Kirche|\"Solidarity Church\"]], an opposition group that sought to create a network across the country that took a critical position in respect of the [[one-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]], and she became a member of its co-ordination committee.   She was nevertheless not without her own criticisms of it.   Her personal experiences made her all too conscious of the shortage of that \"solidarity\" which the group purported to represent, and she called for more radical thought and action.   Her contribution was more individualistic and less \"collegiate\" than that of many of the opposition activists in the build-up to the so-called \"[[Peaceful Revolution]]\".   She always remained in touch with the more important of the opposition groups, however.   Because her activities involved much travelling between the country's various regions, she was able to network intensively between opposition groups on a personal level.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\nIn November 1987 Klier and Krawczyk sent a joint open letter to [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party's]] top ideologist, [[Kurt Hager]].   Copies of this letter were widely distributed through the usual informal channels across East Germany and it was also published in the West German media.   It was read out at a church concert on 9 November 1987.<ref name=FKlautCB>{{cite web|url=http://www.exil-club.de/html/30_projekte/31_projekte_00/biografien/klier/wirken.htm|author=Christina Buck|title=Freya Kliers Wirken in der DDR|publisher=Deutsche Zentrum f\u00fcr Verfolgte K\u00fcnste|accessdate=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021251/http://www.exil-club.de/html/30_projekte/31_projekte_00/biografien/klier/wirken.htm|archive-date=25 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>   The letter criticised social conditions in East Germany and called for extensive reforms.   At the same time Klier and Krawczyk agreed together to take part in the annual mass parade held each year in January to honour [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], two pioneers of German Communism who had been assassinated during [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|months of revolution]] that followed the [[First World War]].   The 69th anniversary of the killings was to be commemorated on 17 January 1988, a Sunday.  It was an officially sanctioned and promoted celebration.   However, Klier and Krawczyk intended to attend it in order to display banners of their own devising.   The idea was to draw attention to their own work bans and to highlight more generally their criticisms of the East German social structure.   However, at the last minute they learned that other dissident demonstrators had planned to use the event to highlight government refusal to permit them to [[Republikflucht|emigrate]] to [[West Germany|the west]], an issue that had never gone away.   It was anticipated that western television teams would attempt to report the demonstration, and in order to avoid the risk of \"mixed messaging\" Klier and Krawczyk decided to leave their own alternative banners at home.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\nWeeks in advance, and well informed as ever, the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] had made their own plans to deal with dissident disruption of the 17 January 1988 celebration.   In a series of house arrests immediately before the event approximately 120 civil rights activists were arrested and held for (and in some cases beyond) the duration of the event.<ref name=LuxLieDem>{{cite web|url=https://www.jugendopposition.de/node/145392?guid=198&0=|title=Luxemburg-Liebknecht-Demonstration| publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische Bildung und Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V.|date= November 2016|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>   (Other sources give the number arrested as 160.)   Those arrested included [[Vera Lengsfeld|Vera Wollenberger]], Herbert Mi\u00dflitz and [[Stephan Krawczyk]].<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Some dissidents nevertheless did participate in the demonstration, and despite the best endeavours of [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] officials, several \"unauthorized\" banners appears on international television reports.   The one that resonated most widely used a quote from [[Rosa Luxemburg]] herself:  \"Freedom is always the freedom to think differently\" (''\"Die Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden\"'').<ref name=LuxLieDem/>\n\nFreya Klier, still at liberty, reacted to the arrests with an appeal, widely reported, to artists in West Germany that they should show solidarity with comrades in [[East Germany|the east]] by not themselves performing in East Germany.<ref name=Appell>{{cite web|title=Radio Glasnost: Appell von Freya Klier an westdeutsche K\u00fcnstler, sich f\u00fcr die Freilassung von Stephan Krawczyk einzusetzen|publisher=Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V., Berlin|url=https://www.jugendopposition.de/node/145392?video=144962#vplayer|author=Freya Klier, Theaterregisseurin, Freunde und Anh\u00e4nger seiner Lieder aus der ganzen DDR| date=21 January 1988|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>   A few days later there was another wave of arrests.   Leading opposition figures targeted now included Regina and [[Wolfgang Templin]], [[:de:Werner Fischer (B\u00fcrgerrechtler)|Werner Fischer]], [[B\u00e4rbel Bohley]], Ralf Hirsch and Freya Klier herself.   East German media launched a reinvigorated defamation campaign against those detained, but in [[West Germany]] and from opposition groups in other [[Soviet Empire|Soviet sponsored states]] in central Europe there came various declarations of support and solidarity.   Nevertheless, there were also certain West German politicians who placed on record their \"understanding\" for the measures taken.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Expulsion ===\nInside East Germany the arrests unleashed the largest wave of solidarity with political prisoners since [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953]].   That was not apparent to the detainees themselves, however, since the only lawyers to whom they were given access were some employed by the [[Stasi]] themselves.   Not only did these lawyers fail to tell their clients what was going on \"outside\":  they also assured their \"clients\" that no one \"outside\" was showing the slightest interest in their fate.  Shortly afterwards the lawyer assigned to Freya Klier, [[Wolfgang Schnur]], greatly surprised her when he went public with vehement criticism of his client.<ref name=Spiegel061988Gespraech/>   It was only some years later, when the Stasi files were [[Stasi Records Agency|opened up]], that his role as a [[Informal collaborator|Stasi collaborator]] would become apparent.<ref name=WSlautZeit>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-01/ddr-oppositionspolitiker-stasi-spitzel-wolfgang-schnur|title=DDR-Anwalt Wolfgang Schnur ist tot|publisher=[[Die Zeit]] (online)|work=Er verteidigte Regimekritiker, nach der Wende flog er als Stasispitzel auf und versuchte sich als Gesch\u00e4ftsmann.

A [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Politburo of the Central Committee|Politburo meeting]] took place on Tuesday 2 February 1988.<ref name=Speigel061988/>   The government felt more insecure than many western commentators assumed at the time, faced with a growing surge of street protests at home and growing uncertainty over whether, in the era of [[Glasnost]], the authorities could still rely on fraternal military support from the [[Soviet Union]] of the kind employed the last time total breakdown had threatened, back in [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953]] (or more recently, in Czechoslovakia, [[Prague Spring|in 1968]]).   Applying a strategy of damage limitation the Politburo decided to expel the imprisoned dissidents to [[West Germany|the west]].   As presented to media by the government lawyer [[Wolfgang Vogel]], this meant that all the detainees would be released, including those in the Stasi's special [[Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial|Hohensch\u00f6nhausen jail]]  facing treason charges, and each one could freely choose whether he or she wished to be released in the [[East Berlin|east]] or in the [[West Berlin|west]].<ref name=Speigel061988>{{cite web|title= DDR ...

Most (though not all) of the other dissidents arrested at the same time, each subjected to their own differing sets of pressures and conditions, were persuaded to reach the same conclusion.   However, in [[West Germany|the west]] Klier and Krawczyk were the most \"high-profile\" of the dissidents expelled.<ref name=Speigel061988/>   All the expelled dissidents stated that one way or another they had been forced to agree to expulsion.

However, neither Klier nor Krawczyk had, in recent years, shown much interest in \"low-profile\" activism.   In the dissident congregations and meetings in East Germany there is reason to believe that the events that followed the 17 January 1988 demonstration, and the publicity they attracted, served only to increase pressure on the state authorities<ref name=Speigel061988/> and to hasten [[Die Wende|the regime's demise]] and thereby the [[East German general election, 1990|return of democracy]] after not quite 58 years of one-party dictatorship.\n\n=== Life in the west ===\nFreya Klier settled in [[West Berlin]].

Today she lives as a freelance author, stage director and film maker.   She ranges widely across political topics, but the East German dictatorship, along with the Nazi dictatorship that preceded it, feature prominently among her themes.   She also retains a role as a political activist, working in political education and making regular presentations in schools.<ref name=FKlautPV/>   In 1996 she was a founding instigator of the [[:de:B\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro (Verein)|B\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro initiative]] in Berlin which provides advice and support for surviving victims of East German's [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|one-party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]].

Her father, who worked as a painter and decorator, became involved in a fight when she was three, defending his wife.   The man whom he hit was an off-duty [[Volkspolizei|policeman]].   Klier's father spent the next twelve months in prison while her mother was switched to night shift work.   Freya and her four-year-old brother were sent to a state orphanage.   The family were reunited a year later, but the children were from this point marked out as the children of political prisoners, a stigma that affected them adversely until the [[German Democratic Republic|East German dictatorship]] finally [[East German general election, 1990|crumbled into history]] in [[German reunification|1990]].<ref name=FKlautISK>{{cite web|title=Freya Klier, geboren 1950|work= Biographisches Lexikon: Widerstand und Opposition im Kommunismus 1945-91|url=https://dissidenten.eu/laender/deutschland-ddr/biografien/freya-klier/freya-klier-teil-1/|author=Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk| date=September 2016 |publisher=Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=23 August 2017|author-link= Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 her brother, at the time barely seventeen years old, was accused of \"slandering the state\" and sentenced to a four-year jail term, following which she resolved to emigrate.   As a result of the slaughter of [[Second World War|war]] in the 1940s and [[Republikflucht|massive emigration]] in the 1950s East Germany was desperately short of working-age population.   By 1966 leaving the country - even temporarily - was for most people \"against the rules\" and impossible.   Freya Klier nevertheless devised a plan to escape with an acquaintance from a Swedish theatre group, armed with a false passport and travelling aboard a [[Sweden|Swedish]] merchant ship.<ref name=FKlautHohensch>{{cite web|title=Freya Klier|work=Biographies |url= http://www.stiftung-hsh.de/history/stasi-prison/biographies/the-eighties/freya-klier-en-gb/|publisher=[[Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial|Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial (Gedenkst\u00e4tte Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen)]]|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>  Shortly before the ship was due to sail, in July 1966, she was betrayed and arrested.   She was sentenced \"for attempting to flee the Republic\" (''wegen \"versuchter Republikflucht\"'')<ref name=FKlautwww/> to a sixteen-month jail term but served only twelve months, after which the four month balance was [[Suspended sentence|\"suspended\"]] for two years.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== After school ===\nIn 1968 she passed her [[Abitur|school final exams (''\"Abitur\"'')]] which under other circumstances would have opened the way to a university-level education, at the same time, due to the subjects studied, earning a diploma in mechanical draftsmanship.   Her school years had involved a \"twin-track\" path, which for her generation was not unusual.   Although she was a member of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]]-backed [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], outside school she was also participating in religious studies.   Later, despite her membership of the [[Free German Youth|party's youth wing (FDJ)]], she was also involved with the church-sponsored [[Katholische Junge Gemeinde|\"Young Community\"]].<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Once she had finished with school and prison she undertook various low status jobs including waitressing and post office work.<ref name=FKlautwww/>   She also took \"behind the scenes\" work with the Dresden Puppet Theatre.<ref name=FKlautFK>{{cite web|url=http://www.freya-klier.de/homepage/bio.html|title=Biographie |author=Freya Klier|work=Mein elftes Gebot: \"Du sollst Dich erinnern!\"|accessdate= 23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre career ===\nIn 1970, thanks to the intervention of a [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Party]] Secretary, Klier was able to embark on a study course at the [[Theaterhochschule Leipzig|Theatre Academy]] in [[Leipzig]], emerging with a degree in 1975.<ref name=FKlautISK/>  Next she received a contract at the [[:de:Neue B\u00fchne Senftenberg|Neue B\u00fchne (theatre)]] in [[Senftenberg]], a small town in the flat countryside north of Dresden, where she worked as an actress.   Alongside the acting she also became increasingly interested in directing.   That led to a four-year period of study at the Berlin Institute for Theater direction, for which she received her diploma in 1982.<ref name=FKlautISK/>   During the early 1980s she worked on productions of works by [[Fernando Arrabal]] (at [[Halle an der Saale|Halle]]), [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]] (at [[Bautzen]]), Carl Sternberg and [[John Millington Synge]] (both at [[Berlin]]).<ref name=FKlautFK/>\n\nIn the 1970s Klier developed a growing interest in the cultural scene in [[Poland]].   That led her, almost unavoidably, to become increasingly critical of the reality of the communist states in central Europe.  She tried to present her criticisms both politically and through her artistic work.   The East German authorities were never receptive to criticism, however finely it might or might not be nuanced.   Accordingly, at this time most of Klier's theatrical productions in East Germany were met with official suspicion or open criticism from the many channels employed by [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]].  Most of her productions found themselves rapidly cancelled or reconfigured (''\"uminszeniert\"''), so that relatively little survives of her own work.   She was, necessarily, a member of the official \"East German Theatrical Union\" (''\"Theaterverband der DDR\"''), but found herself prevented from accepting invitations to work in theatres abroad - for instance in [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]].   Sources attribute this to the critical stance detected in much of her theatre work and to her involvement, from 1981, in the church-backed [[:de:Friedensbewegung#In der DDR|peace movement]].<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Nevertheless, in 1984 she received a director's prize for the premier of \"Legende vom Gl\u00fcck ohne Ende\" (''\"Legends of Endless Joy\"'') by [[Ulrich Plenzdorf]] at the [[:de:Uckerm\u00e4rkische B\u00fchnen Schwedt|Schwedt Theatre]] where she was working between 1982 and 1984.   Despite, or possibly because of this accolade, she left the theatre that year, and in 1985, after resigning her [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] membership in April, she was served with a ban on further professional work.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Beyond theatre ===\nKlier became increasingly involved with the [[:de:Friedenskreis Pankow|Pankow Peace Circle]] in East Berlin during the early 1980s.   The Pankow circle was, for many years, one of the more active and high-profile (but still localised) opposition groups cautiously emerging at the time.   She was nevertheless internally conflicted because of her professional goals, and tried to integrate her artistic ambitions and her political goals.   That was not always easy.   In July 1981 she staged a small production for a church peace festival despite the threat of exclusion from the Institute for Theater direction (at which she was studying).<ref name=FKlautISK/>   Her preference for true facts also made the authorities nervous.   In order to provide a factual basis for the social critique incorporated in and promoted by her artistic work, in 1983 Freya Klier began to make systematic enquiries of women with children about their home lives.   She had herself been a single mother since the birth of Nadja, her daughter, in 1973:  she knew from personal experience that there was a stark contrast between official propaganda and the actual condition of women in society.   But her questionnaire based approach threatened a national taboo.   Sociological or demographic studies were to be undertaken only by a small number of researchers who enjoyed the confidence of [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party]].   Otherwise there was an ever-present danger that \"right theory\" might be undermined by \"false empiricism\".<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Stephan Krawczyk ===\nIn February 1984 Klier met the songwriter [[Stephan Krawczyk]].   At the start of the 1980s he was a member of the still younger generation of artists whom the authorities confidently saw as the great hope for the nation's artistic future.   He had won first prize at the 1981 [[:de:Chansontage der DDR|National Song Festival]] and was, naturally, a [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] member.   It was only in April 1985 that he resigned his party membership\".<ref name=FKlautISK/><ref name=SKlautwww>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3b-1424.html?ID=1894|title=Krawczyk, Stephan * 31.12.1955 Liedermacher, Schriftsteller, Dissident|author=Silvia M\u00fcller| publisher=Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin| accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>   Krawczyk had by this time become something of an iconic figure, especially for younger East German fans:  later in 1985 he and Klier were both served with what amounted to a nationwide ban on professional work (''Berufsverbot''), which was linked with exclusion from the national \"Theatrical Union\" (''\"Theaterverband\"'').   The authorities, with a characteristic absence of subtelty, sought to destroy Krawczyk's fan base, describing him as a \"national enemy\" (''\"Staatsfeind\"'') and even as the \"new [[Wolf Biermann]]\".<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Opposing dictatorship ===\nOver the next twelve months the two of them worked together on a programme of dramatic pieces and prose readings critical of the \"socialist\" society.<ref name=FKlautwww/>    These received supportive responses from audiences of church groups and in community halls.   The authorities responded by pressuring the church authorities to block their appearances.   But as matters turned out there were more and more churches and community groups that continued to provide them with venues for their presentations.   Klier and Krawczyk (who married in 1986) also found themselves deluged with official ordinances and injunctions.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\nDuring 1985, believing that she had identified the roots of the country's dictatorship in its education system, Klier began a new questionnaire-based research project into the East German education and training system.   She conducted structured interviews with young people and, from 1986, with teachers, revealing a picture of a society riddled with dishonesty, depression and hopelessness.   At the same time she found that the limits of the state's ideological power to influence had been reached, and that most young people  of the 80s generation - if only inwardly - resisted [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party's]] preposterous claims for the society over which it presided.   Klier's researches were written up and presented early in 1990 in her book \"L\u00fcg Vaterland. Erziehung in der DDR\" (''loosely: \"Lie, Fatherland: Education in East Germany\"''), the publication of which excited much attention during a critical year in East German history.<ref name=FKlautISK/><ref name=FKlautKAS>{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_8879-1442-1-30.pdf?130207124520|title=Freya Klier ...

The [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (''Stasi'')]] subjected them both to a programme of intense monitoring, identified in their files as \"Operation Sinus\" (''\"OV Sinus\"'').   As a result of Stasi interventions it became increasingly difficult to organise presentations.   Their car was tampered with several times:  on at least one occasion the brake cable on one side was cut.  Krawczyk experience a nerve gas attack as he was opening the car door.<ref name=FKlautPV>{{cite web|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/freiburg/zeitzeugen-lassen-sich-nicht-ersetzen--56661689.html|title=Zeitzeugen lassen sich nicht ersetzen|work=Die DDR-B\u00fcrgerrechtlerin und Schriftstellerin Freya Klier erz\u00e4hlte am Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium von ihrem Leben im Widerstand. |date=7 March 2012| author=Petra V\u00f6lzing|publisher=Badischer Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nevertheless, unlike her sixteen year old self, Freya Klier was now determined to stay the course and not to abandon East Germany.<ref name=FKlautISK/><ref name=FKlautKAS/>\n\nIn October 1986 Klier was a co-founder of the [[:de:Arbeitskreis Solidarische Kirche|\"Solidarity Church\"]], an opposition group that sought to create a network across the country that took a critical position in respect of the [[one-party state|one-]][[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]], and she became a member of its co-ordination committee.   She was nevertheless not without her own criticisms of it.   Her personal experiences made her all too conscious of the shortage of that \"solidarity\" which the group purported to represent, and she called for more radical thought and action.   Her contribution was more individualistic and less \"collegiate\" than that of many of the opposition activists in the build-up to the so-called \"[[Peaceful Revolution]]\".   She always remained in touch with the more important of the opposition groups, however.   Because her activities involved much travelling between the country's various regions, she was able to network intensively between opposition groups on a personal level.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\nIn November 1987 Klier and Krawczyk sent a joint open letter to [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the party's]] top ideologist, [[Kurt Hager]].   Copies of this letter were widely distributed through the usual informal channels across East Germany and it was also published in the West German media.   It was read out at a church concert on 9 November 1987.<ref name=FKlautCB>{{cite web|url=http://www.exil-club.de/html/30_projekte/31_projekte_00/biografien/klier/wirken.htm|author=Christina Buck|title=Freya Kliers Wirken in der DDR|publisher=Deutsche Zentrum f\u00fcr Verfolgte K\u00fcnste|accessdate=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021251/http://www.exil-club.de/html/30_projekte/31_projekte_00/biografien/klier/wirken.htm|archive-date=25 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>   The letter criticised social conditions in East Germany and called for extensive reforms.   At the same time Klier and Krawczyk agreed together to take part in the annual mass parade held each year in January to honour [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], two pioneers of German Communism who had been assassinated during [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|months of revolution]] that followed the [[First World War]].   The 69th anniversary of the killings was to be commemorated on 17 January 1988, a Sunday.  It was an officially sanctioned and promoted celebration.   However, Klier and Krawczyk intended to attend it in order to display banners of their own devising.   The idea was to draw attention to their own work bans and to highlight more generally their criticisms of the East German social structure.   However, at the last minute they learned that other dissident demonstrators had planned to use the event to highlight government refusal to permit them to [[Republikflucht|emigrate]] to [[West Germany|the west]], an issue that had never gone away.   It was anticipated that western television teams would attempt to report the demonstration, and in order to avoid the risk of \"mixed messaging\" Klier and Krawczyk decided to leave their own alternative banners at home.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\nWeeks in advance, and well informed as ever, the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] had made their own plans to deal with dissident disruption of the 17 January 1988 celebration.   In a series of house arrests immediately before the event approximately 120 civil rights activists were arrested and held for (and in some cases beyond) the duration of the event.<ref name=LuxLieDem>{{cite web|url=https://www.jugendopposition.de/node/145392?guid=198&0=|title=Luxemburg-Liebknecht-Demonstration| publisher=Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr politische Bildung und Robert-Havemann-Gesellschaft e.V.|date= November 2016|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref>   (Other sources give the number arrested as 160.)

Leading opposition figures targeted now included Regina and [[Wolfgang Templin]], [[:de:Werner Fischer (B\u00fcrgerrechtler)|Werner Fischer]], [[B\u00e4rbel Bohley]], Ralf Hirsch and Freya Klier herself.   East German media launched a reinvigorated defamation campaign against those detained, but in [[West Germany]] and from opposition groups in other [[Soviet Empire|Soviet sponsored states]] in central Europe there came various declarations of support and solidarity.   Nevertheless, there were also certain West German politicians who placed on record their \"understanding\" for the measures taken.<ref name=FKlautISK/>\n\n=== Expulsion ===\nInside East Germany the arrests unleashed the largest wave of solidarity with political prisoners since [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953]].   That was not apparent to the detainees themselves, however, since the only lawyers to whom they were given access were some employed by the [[Stasi]] themselves.   Not only did these lawyers fail to tell their clients what was going on \"outside\":  they also assured their \"clients\" that no one \"outside\" was showing the slightest interest in their fate.  Shortly afterwards the lawyer assigned to Freya Klier, [[Wolfgang Schnur]], greatly surprised her when he went public with vehement criticism of his client.<ref name=Spiegel061988Gespraech/>   It was only some years later, when the Stasi files were [[Stasi Records Agency|opened up]], that his role as a [[Informal collaborator|Stasi collaborator]] would become apparent.<ref name=WSlautZeit>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-01/ddr-oppositionspolitiker-stasi-spitzel-wolfgang-schnur|title=DDR-Anwalt Wolfgang Schnur ist tot|publisher=[[Die Zeit]] (online)|work=Er verteidigte Regimekritiker, nach der Wende flog er als Stasispitzel auf und versuchte sich als Gesch\u00e4ftsmann.

A [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Politburo of the Central Committee|Politburo meeting]] took place on Tuesday 2 February 1988.<ref name=Speigel061988/>   The government felt more insecure than many western commentators assumed at the time, faced with a growing surge of street protests at home and growing uncertainty over whether, in the era of [[Glasnost]], the authorities could still rely on fraternal military support from the [[Soviet Union]] of the kind employed the last time total breakdown had threatened, back in [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953]] (or more recently, in Czechoslovakia, [[Prague Spring|in 1968]]).   Applying a strategy of damage limitation the Politburo decided to expel the imprisoned dissidents to [[West Germany|the west]].   As presented to media by the government lawyer [[Wolfgang Vogel]], this meant that all the detainees would be released, including those in the Stasi's special [[Berlin-Hohensch\u00f6nhausen Memorial|Hohensch\u00f6nhausen jail]]  facing treason charges, and each one could freely choose whether he or she wished to be released in the [[East Berlin|east]] or in the [[West Berlin|west]].<ref name=Speigel061988>{{cite web|title= DDR ...

Most (though not all) of the other dissidents arrested at the same time, each subjected to their own differing sets of pressures and conditions, were persuaded to reach the same conclusion.   However, in [[West Germany|the west]] Klier and Krawczyk were the most \"high-profile\" of the dissidents expelled.<ref name=Speigel061988/>   All the expelled dissidents stated that one way or another they had been forced to agree to expulsion.   On arriving in the west Klier's first public action was arrange for her lawyer to read a sixteen line prepared statement to the television cameras stressing that she and Krawcyk had not left their country voluntarily, and were keen to return home as soon as possible.<ref name=Speigel061988/>   There were nevertheless accusations of betrayal from a number of \"left-wing\" East German dissidents left behind.<ref name=FKlautISK/>   A few days later Klier and Krawczyk gave an interview to [[Der Spiegel]] setting out their situation and some of the background to it more fully, and describing the treatment to which they had been subjected following their arrest.<ref name=Spiegel061988Gespraech/>   They repeated in the strongest possible terms their insistence that there had been nothing voluntary about their sudden appearance in the west.<ref name=Spiegel061988Gespraech>{{cite web|date=8 February 1988|title= Spiegel Gespr\u00e4ch: \"Ein schwerer R\u00fcckfall in die f\u00fcnfziger Jahre\" ....

However, neither Klier nor Krawczyk had, in recent years, shown much interest in \"low-profile\" activism.   In the dissident congregations and meetings in East Germany there is reason to believe that the events that followed the 17 January 1988 demonstration, and the publicity they attracted, served only to increase pressure on the state authorities<ref name=Speigel061988/> and to hasten [[Die Wende|the regime's demise]] and thereby the [[East German general election, 1990|return of democracy]] after not quite 58 years of one-party dictatorship.\n\n=== Life in the west ===\nFreya Klier settled in [[West Berlin]].   Two years later Berlin was reunified in the wider context of the [[German reunification|reunification process]].   Her marriage to [[:de:Stephan Krawczyk|Stephan Krawczyk]] lasted only till 1992.   Today she lives as a freelance author, stage director and film maker.   She ranges widely across political topics, but the East German dictatorship, along with the Nazi dictatorship that preceded it, feature prominently among her themes.   She also retains a role as a political activist, working in political education and making regular presentations in schools.<ref name=FKlautPV/>   In 1996 she was a founding instigator of the [[:de:B\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro (Verein)|B\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro initiative]] in Berlin which provides advice and support for surviving victims of East German's [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|one-party]] [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]].

According to one view, 'zo' means 'highland' (or hill) and Mizoram means 'land of the Mizos'. B.

The general geology of western Mizoram consists of repetitive succession of Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Surma Group and Tipam Formation such as sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and rare pockets of shell limestone. The eastern part is the Barail Group.<ref name=gsi/> Mizoram lies in [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone V]], according to the India Meteorological Department; as with other northeastern states of India, this means the state has the highest risk of earthquakes relative to other parts of India.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=India Meteorological Department |title=Seismic zoning map |url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/seismo/static/seismo-zone.htm |accessdate=20 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603143951/http://www.imd.gov.in/section/seismo/static/seismo-zone.htm |archivedate=3 June 2014  }}</ref>\n\nThe biggest river in Mizoram is Chhimtuipui, also known as Kaladan (or Kolodyne). It originates in Chin state in Burma and passes through [[Saiha district|Saiha]] and [[Lawngtlai district|Lawngtlai]] districts in the southern tip of Mizoram, goes back to Burma's Rakhine state. Although many more rivers and streams drain the hill ranges, the most important and useful rivers are the [[Tlawng]], [[Tut River|Tut]], [[Tuirial River|Tuirial]] and [[Tuivawl River|Tuivawl]] which flow through the northern territory and eventually join the [[Barak River]] in [[Cachar District]]. The rivers have a gentle drainage gradient particularly in the south.<ref name=gsi/>\n\nPalak lake is the biggest in Mizoram and covers {{convert|30|ha|acre}}. The lake is situated in Saiha district of southern Mizoram. It is believed that the lake was created as a result of an earthquake or a flood. The local people believe that a submerged village remains intact deep under the waters. The [[Tam Dil]] lake is a natural lake situated {{convert|85|km|mi}} from Aizawl. Legend has it that a huge [[mustard plant]] once stood in this place. When the plant was cut down, jets of water sprayed from the plant and created a pool of water, thus the lake was named \u0162am Dil which means of 'lake of mustard plant'. Today the lake is an important tourist attraction and a holiday resort. The most significant lake in Mizo history, [[Rih Lake|Rih Dil]], is ironically located in Burma, a few kilometres from the Indo-Burma border. It was believed that departed souls pass through this lake before making their way to [[Pialral]] or heaven. Mizoram is also called{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} a \"peninsula state\" as it is surrounded by international borders on three sides.\n\n===Climate===\nMizoram has a mild climate, being relatively cool in summer {{convert|20|to|29|C|F}} but progressively warmer, most probably due to climate change, with summer temperatures crossing 30 degrees Celsius and winter temperatures ranging from {{convert|7|to|22|C|F}}.

The rule was hereditary, and there were no written laws (the first script for Mizo language was developed by [[Christian Missionaries|Christian missionaries]] Lorraine and Savidge about 1895).<ref name=misai/>\n\nAfter annexation by the [[British Empire|British]] in the 1890s, northern part of Mizoram was administered as the [[Lushai Hills]] district of [[Assam]], while southern Mizoram was part of [[Bengal]]. In 1898, the southern part was transferred from Bengal to Assam. The colonial power retained the chiefs and Mizo customs, including the socially stratified hereditary transfer of political power. In 1937, under Section 6 of the Scheduled District Act, the British administration<ref name=misai/> consolidated executive and legislative political power to the [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]] and [[District magistrate|District Magistrates]], with village chiefs in advisory role. The political and judiciary powers of chiefs were neither final nor exclusive, thereafter. Rulings could be appealed to courts staffed with British officials. After India gained independence from the colonial rule, the region was granted autonomous status in 1952, where Mizo people formulated their own laws and delivered judicial decisions. The region was renamed as Mizo District within Assam State in April 1954 and in that year, the institution of hereditary chieftainship was abolished, and instead village courts/council were set up.<ref name=misai/> In the same year the [[Young Mizo Association]] was formed which is still an important institution in Mizoram.\n\nThe representatives of the Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council and the [[Mizo Union]] pleaded with the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] (SRC) to integrate the Mizo-dominated areas of [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]] with the District Council in Assam.

A medical college, Mizoram Institute of Medical Education and Research (MIMER) was also inaugurated on 2018 and offer 100 seats for MBBS course.\n\n==Culture==\nThe culture of the Mizo tribes and its social structure has undergone tremendous change over 100 years, since the arrival of Christianity in the late 1890s. Contemporary people of Mizoram celebrate Christmas, Easter and other Christian celebrations replacing many of old tribal customs and practices.\n\nThe growth of Christianity, scholars state,<ref>Z. Hlawndo, A STUDY OF THE CULTURAL FACTORS IN THE FOREIGN MISSIONS THINKING OF THE MIZORAM PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Ph.D. Thesis (Awarded), University of Birmingham (2011)</ref> was shaped from a foundation of cultural, religious and socio-political structure. One such foundation cultural element of Mizo people was ''Hnatlang'', states Hlawndo, which literally means social work, united labour or community labour (the word hna\u2018 means job or work in the Mizo language; and tlang\u2018 means together and mutual). The tribal members who were absent from such social work (for reasons other than illness and disability) were penalised \u2014 a form of strong peer pressure. Jhum cultivation and raids on neighbouring tribes required ''Hnatlang'', the spirit of united labour and equal sharing of the end result.\n\nA consequence of Hnatlang was the culture of ''Tlawmngaihna'', which does not have a direct English translation. ''Tlawmngaihna'' as cultural concept incorporates behaviour that is self-sacrificing, self-denying, doing what an occasion demands unselfishly and without concern for inconvenience caused, persevering, stoical, stout-hearted, plucky, brave, firm, independent, loath to lose one's good reputation.<ref>James Dokhuma, \"Tlawmngaihna\" in Meichher, Vol XI, No. 11, April 1976</ref><ref name=nepa>Nevill Parry, {{Google books|ZZsJAQAAIAAJ|Lushai Custom: A monograph on customs and ceremonies}}</ref><ref>K.

The man and the woman could have many partners. If the woman got pregnant, the man was required either marry or pay a substantial sum called ''Sawnman''. If the woman's parents discover the relationship, they had a right to demand a payment called ''Khumpuikaiman''.

They belong to numerous tribes; however, to name a particular tribe as the largest is difficult as no concrete census has ever been undertaken.\n\nSometime in the 16th century CE, the first batch of Mizo crossed Tiau river and settled in Mizoram and they were called as [[Kuki people|Kukis]] by [[Bengalis]].<ref name=lsmgov/> The term Kuki mean the inhabitants of the interior and inaccessible mountain tracts.

Different tribes and sub-tribes arrived in the present Mizoram, in successive waves and settled down in different parts of the state. Further, as they arrived, there were raids, fear of raids and intertribal feuds. The resulting isolation and separation created numerous tribes and sub-tribes.<ref name=lsmgov/> The Mizo people usually suffix their descriptive given names with their tribe.\n\nOther than tribal groups, other ethnic groups inhabit Mizoram.

The institution of [[chieftainship]] began in the 16th century. Each village behaved like a small state, and the chief was called ''Lal''. The rule was hereditary, and there were no written laws (the first script for Mizo language was developed by [[Christian Missionaries|Christian missionaries]] Lorraine and Savidge about 1895).<ref name=misai/>\n\nAfter annexation by the [[British Empire|British]] in the 1890s, northern part of Mizoram was administered as the [[Lushai Hills]] district of [[Assam]], while southern Mizoram was part of [[Bengal]]. In 1898, the southern part was transferred from Bengal to Assam. The colonial power retained the chiefs and Mizo customs, including the socially stratified hereditary transfer of political power. In 1937, under Section 6 of the Scheduled District Act, the British administration<ref name=misai/> consolidated executive and legislative political power to the [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]] and [[District magistrate|District Magistrates]], with village chiefs in advisory role. The political and judiciary powers of chiefs were neither final nor exclusive, thereafter. Rulings could be appealed to courts staffed with British officials. After India gained independence from the colonial rule, the region was granted autonomous status in 1952, where Mizo people formulated their own laws and delivered judicial decisions. The region was renamed as Mizo District within Assam State in April 1954 and in that year, the institution of hereditary chieftainship was abolished, and instead village courts/council were set up.<ref name=misai/> In the same year the [[Young Mizo Association]] was formed which is still an important institution in Mizoram.\n\nThe representatives of the Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council and the [[Mizo Union]] pleaded with the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] (SRC) to integrate the Mizo-dominated areas of [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]] with the District Council in Assam. The tribal leaders in the northeast were unhappy with the final SRC recommendations and met in Aizawl in 1955 to form a new political party, [[Eastern Indian Tribal Union|Eastern India Tribal Union (EITU)]].<ref name=dommen>Dommen, A.

Instruction is mainly in English and Mizo. Under the 10+2+3 plan, students may enroll in general or professional degree programs after passing the Higher Secondary Examination (the grade 12 examination). Mizoram has one [[Central University, India|Central University]] ([[Mizoram University]]), one engineering college ([[National Institute of Technology Mizoram]]) and one private university (a branch of the [[Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India]]). A medical college, Mizoram Institute of Medical Education and Research (MIMER) was also inaugurated on 2018 and offer 100 seats for MBBS course.\n\n==Culture==\nThe culture of the Mizo tribes and its social structure has undergone tremendous change over 100 years, since the arrival of Christianity in the late 1890s. Contemporary people of Mizoram celebrate Christmas, Easter and other Christian celebrations replacing many of old tribal customs and practices.\n\nThe growth of Christianity, scholars state,<ref>Z. Hlawndo, A STUDY OF THE CULTURAL FACTORS IN THE FOREIGN MISSIONS THINKING OF THE MIZORAM PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Ph.D. Thesis (Awarded), University of Birmingham (2011)</ref> was shaped from a foundation of cultural, religious and socio-political structure. One such foundation cultural element of Mizo people was ''Hnatlang'', states Hlawndo, which literally means social work, united labour or community labour (the word hna\u2018 means job or work in the Mizo language; and tlang\u2018 means together and mutual). The tribal members who were absent from such social work (for reasons other than illness and disability) were penalised \u2014 a form of strong peer pressure. Jhum cultivation and raids on neighbouring tribes required ''Hnatlang'', the spirit of united labour and equal sharing of the end result.\n\nA consequence of Hnatlang was the culture of ''Tlawmngaihna'', which does not have a direct English translation. ''Tlawmngaihna'' as cultural concept incorporates behaviour that is self-sacrificing, self-denying, doing what an occasion demands unselfishly and without concern for inconvenience caused, persevering, stoical, stout-hearted, plucky, brave, firm, independent, loath to lose one's good reputation.<ref>James Dokhuma, \"Tlawmngaihna\" in Meichher, Vol XI, No. 11, April 1976</ref><ref name=nepa>Nevill Parry, {{Google books|ZZsJAQAAIAAJ|Lushai Custom: A monograph on customs and ceremonies}}</ref><ref>K.

The man and the woman could have many partners. If the woman got pregnant, the man was required either marry or pay a substantial sum called ''Sawnman''. If the woman's parents discover the relationship, they had a right to demand a payment called ''Khumpuikaiman''.

The updated building opened in time for the 2017\u201318 men's and women's basketball season.<ref>https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2016/09/harvard-renovates-allston-basketball-arena</ref>\n\n[[File:Ray Lavietes Athletic Pavilion.jpg|thumb|left|The Ray Lavietes Basketball Pavilion at the Briggs Athletic Center]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/mbkb/facilities/lavieties Lavietes Pavilion at GoCrimson.com]\n\n{{Harvard Crimson men's basketball navbox}}\n{{Harvard}}\n{{Ivy League basketball venue navbox}}\n{{Greater Boston sports arenas}}\n\n[[Category:Harvard University]]\n[[Category:College basketball venues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Boston]]\n[[Category:Basketball venues in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Harvard Crimson basketball]]\n[[Category:Indoor arenas in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1926]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in Massachusetts]]\n\n{{Massachusetts-sports-venue-stub|Boston=y}}\n{{Boston-struct-stub}}\n{{Boston-sport-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Joeykai", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavietes_Pavilion"}
