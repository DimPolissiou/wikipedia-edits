Plot summaries for films on Wikipedia are recommended to be between 400-700 words. All edits in this section are logged and reviewed. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nIn [[New York Harbor]], filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], known for wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the ''Venture'', for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate [[Jack Driscoll|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann.\n\nDenham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They rebuff him and return to the ''Venture''.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the wall gate and to an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], an enormous [[gorilla]]-like creature. Kong carries a terrified Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to defeat. After facing a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and Kong himself, Jack and Denham are the only survivors.\n\nA ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Jack continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, shoves Jack aside, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grip. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and then climbs the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes sorrowfully at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fay Wray]] as Ann Darrow\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as [[Jack Driscoll|John \u201cJack\u201d Driscoll]]\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]] as Charles Weston\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as the Native Chief\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as the Witch King\n* [[James Flavin]] as Briggs, 2nd Mate\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie the Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as the Native in [[Ape]] Costume (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Kong (1933), Brontosaur.jpeg|thumb|An articulated skeleton of the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' used in the film.]]\nBefore ''King Kong'' entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films (for example ''[[Stark Mad]]'') generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth. In these films, scientific knowledge could be subverted at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had [[primate]] exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] had earlier [[monkey]] experience directing ''[[Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness]]'' (1927), also with [[Merian C. Cooper]], and ''[[Rango (1931 film)|Rango]]'' (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)], repr. ''Gerald Peary: Film Reviews, Interviews, Essays and Sundry Miscellany'', 2004.</ref> The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates it was one of the highest-grossing films of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed ''Ingagi'' among his influences for ''King Kong,'' it has long been held that RKO green-lit ''Kong'' because of the bottom-line example of ''Ingagi'' and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Erish | title=Illegitimate Dad of King Kong | date=January 8, 2006| newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading W. Douglas Burden's ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\"Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper called in [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\"Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \u201cmythic elements\u201d, believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\"Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\"Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled ''Kong'' for production.<ref>Morton, p. 28\u20139</ref> Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.<ref>Morton, p. 29</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been principally sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Retrieved 1st February 2017</ref>\n\nKong's torso was streamlined to eliminate the comical appearance of the real world gorilla's prominent belly and buttocks. His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.<ref>Morton 33\u20135</ref>\n[[Image:Img kingkong1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[stop-motion]] animated King Kong atop the [[Empire State Building]] and battling a [[Curtiss F8C Helldiver]] airplane]]\nA huge bust of Kong's head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E.

Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a flatcar. Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.<ref>Morton 35\u20136</ref>\n\nTwo versions of Kong's right hand and arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The first hand was non articulated, mounted on a crane, and operated by grips for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.<ref>Morton 36</ref>\n[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles R.

Knight]]'s murals in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for ''Creation'' and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and war planes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling and killing the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's proteg\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\n[[File:KingKong001C.png|thumb|Colored publicity shot combining live actors with [[stop motion animation]].]] Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like [[reptile]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 August 1961}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1990}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|authorlink1=Donald F.

Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver]] war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\"Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded growls of zoo [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>Shay, Don. (1982) ''Cinefex'' issues 7\u201310 page 41</ref>\n\nFor budgetary reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer [[Max Steiner]] to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|accessdate=March 28, 2011|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File:Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.

(2012). The Classical Hollywood Reader. London: Routledge. P.351.</ref> The [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]'s stricter decency rules had been put into effect in Hollywood after its 1933 premiere and it was progressively censored further, with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether.\n\nThese scenes were as follows:<ref name=\"Morton83-4\">Morton 83\u20134</ref>\n*A ''Brontosaurus'' mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him;\n*Kong undressing Ann Darrow and sniffing his fingers;\n*Kong biting and stepping on natives when he attacks the village;\n*Kong biting a reporter in New York;\n*Kong mistaking a sleeping woman for Ann and dropping her to her death, after realizing his mistake.\n*An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a lizard and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong into the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards, and thus the scene was studio self-censored prior to original release. Though searched for, the footage is now considered \"lost forever\" with only a few stills and pre-production drawings <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wednesday |first1=WTM \u2022 |title=The Lost Scene from 1933's King Kong - the Spider Pit |url=https://www.neatorama.com/2018/12/12/The-Lost-Scene-from-1933-s-King-Kong-the-Spider-Pit/ |website=Neatorama |accessdate=28 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television (first being broadcast March 5, 1956).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rainho|first1=Manny|title=This Month in Movie History|journal=Classic Images|date=March 2015|issue=477|page=26}}</ref>\n\nRKO did not preserve copies of film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to [[art house]]s by [[Janus Films]] in 1970.<ref name=\"Morton83-4\"/>\n\nOver the next two decades, [[Universal Studios]] carried out further photochemical restoration on ''King Kong''. This was based on a 1942 release print, with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which \"contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.\"<ref>[http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/dcp/news/king-kong/43148 Millimeter Magazine article, 1 January 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521015000/http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/dcp/news/king-kong/43148 |date=May 21, 2013}} Retrieved: March 15, 2012</ref> An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality.\n\nAfter a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital, restoration utilizing [[4K resolution]] [[Image scanner|scanning]] was completed by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2005.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/articles/robertharris/harris102505.html \"Robert A.

Those included a [[Turner Home Entertainment|Turner]] 60th anniversary edition in 1993 featuring a front cover which had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It also included the colorized version of the film and a 25-minute documentary, ''It Was Beauty Killed the Beast'' (1992). The documentary is also available on two different UK ''King Kong'' DVDs, while the colorized version is available on DVD in the UK and Italy.<ref>[http://dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=2930 DVDCompare.com: ''King Kong'' (1933)] Retrieved: April 8, 2012</ref> [[Warner Home Video]] re-released the black and white version on VHS with the 25-minute documentary included under the ''Warner Bros.

It had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by [[visual effects]] artists [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Ken Ralston]], with archival excerpts from actress [[Fay Wray]] and producer/director [[Merian C.

All Universal's releases only contain their earlier, 100 minute, pre-2005 restoration.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, in the UK, Warner Home Video released the film digitally and on Blu-Ray and DVD in early 2017. The Blu-Ray contained the same contents as the  US release, but unfortunately for the DVD, that was based on the first Disc of the 2-Disc DVD release.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe 1933 ''King Kong'' film and character inspired imitations and installments. ''[[Son of Kong]]'', a direct sequel to the 1933 film was released nine months after the first film's release. In the early 1960s, RKO had licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio [[Toho]] and produced two King Kong films, ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (a crossover with the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' series]]) and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', both directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]].\n\nIn 1976, Italian producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] released his version of [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], a modern remake of the 1933 film, which was followed by a sequel in 1986 titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]''. In 2005, [[Universal Pictures]] released another remake of [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'']], directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] released a Kong reboot film titled ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' in 2017 which was directed by [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]] and is the second installment of a shared universe called the [[MonsterVerse]], which started with Legendary's reboot of '' [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Speculative fiction/Horror|United States}}\n* [[List of films featuring giant monsters]]\n* [[List of stop motion films]]\n* [[1933 in film]]\n* [[List of highest-grossing films]]\n* [[Skull Island]]\n* ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930)\n* ''[[Stark Mad]]'' (1929)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web |author=American Film Institute |author-link=American Film Institute |date=June 17, 2008 |title=AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres |url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 |accessdate=February 20, 2010}}\n*Annette, Kuhn.

Plot summaries for films on Wikipedia are recommended to be between 400-700 words. All edits in this section are logged and reviewed. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nIn [[New York Harbor]], filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], known for wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the ''Venture'', for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate [[Jack Driscoll|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann.\n\nDenham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They rebuff him and return to the ''Venture''.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the wall gate and to an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], an enormous [[gorilla]]-like creature. Kong carries a terrified Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to defeat. After facing a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and Kong himself, Jack and Denham are the only survivors.\n\nA ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Jack continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, shoves Jack aside, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grip. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and then climbs the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes sorrowfully at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fay Wray]] as Ann Darrow\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as [[Jack Driscoll|John \u201cJack\u201d Driscoll]]\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]] as Charles Weston\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as the Native Chief\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as the Witch King\n* [[James Flavin]] as Briggs, 2nd Mate\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie the Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as the Native in [[Ape]] Costume (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Kong (1933), Brontosaur.jpeg|thumb|An articulated skeleton of the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' used in the film.]]\nBefore ''King Kong'' entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films (for example ''[[Stark Mad]]'') generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth. In these films, scientific knowledge could be subverted at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had [[primate]] exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] had earlier [[monkey]] experience directing ''[[Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness]]'' (1927), also with [[Merian C. Cooper]], and ''[[Rango (1931 film)|Rango]]'' (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)], repr. ''Gerald Peary: Film Reviews, Interviews, Essays and Sundry Miscellany'', 2004.</ref> The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates it was one of the highest-grossing films of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed ''Ingagi'' among his influences for ''King Kong,'' it has long been held that RKO green-lit ''Kong'' because of the bottom-line example of ''Ingagi'' and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Erish | title=Illegitimate Dad of King Kong | date=January 8, 2006| newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading W. Douglas Burden's ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\"Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper called in [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\"Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \u201cmythic elements\u201d, believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\"Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\"Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled ''Kong'' for production.<ref>Morton, p. 28\u20139</ref> Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.<ref>Morton, p. 29</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been principally sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and war planes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling and killing the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's proteg\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\n[[File:KingKong001C.png|thumb|Colored publicity shot combining live actors interacting with stop motion animation.]] Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like [[reptile]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 August 1961}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1990}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|authorlink1=Donald F.

Perhaps a human actor was used in a bit of forgotten test footage before the film went into production, but thus far the matter remains a mystery.}}</ref>\n\n===Live-action scenes===\n''King Kong'' was filmed in several stages over an eight-month period. Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver]] war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\"Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded growls of zoo [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>Shay, Don. (1982) ''Cinefex'' issues 7\u201310 page 41</ref>\n\nFor budgetary reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer [[Max Steiner]] to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|accessdate=March 28, 2011|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File:Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.

P.351.</ref> The [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]'s stricter decency rules had been put into effect in Hollywood after its 1933 premiere and it was progressively censored further, with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether.\n\nThese scenes were as follows:<ref name=\"Morton83-4\">Morton 83\u20134</ref>\n*A ''Brontosaurus'' mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him;\n*Kong undressing Ann Darrow and sniffing his fingers;\n*Kong biting and stepping on natives when he attacks the village;\n*Kong biting a reporter in New York;\n*Kong mistaking a sleeping woman for Ann and dropping her to her death, after realizing his mistake.\n*An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a lizard and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong into the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards, and thus the scene was studio self-censored prior to original release. Though searched for, the footage is now considered \"lost forever\" with only a few stills and pre-production drawings <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wednesday |first1=WTM \u2022 |title=The Lost Scene from 1933's King Kong - the Spider Pit |url=https://www.neatorama.com/2018/12/12/The-Lost-Scene-from-1933-s-King-Kong-the-Spider-Pit/ |website=Neatorama |accessdate=28 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television (first being broadcast March 5, 1956).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rainho|first1=Manny|title=This Month in Movie History|journal=Classic Images|date=March 2015|issue=477|page=26}}</ref>\n\nRKO did not preserve copies of film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to [[art house]]s by [[Janus Films]] in 1970.<ref name=\"Morton83-4\"/>\n\nOver the next two decades, [[Universal Studios]] carried out further photochemical restoration on ''King Kong''. This was based on a 1942 release print, with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which \"contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.\"<ref>[http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/dcp/news/king-kong/43148 Millimeter Magazine article, 1 January 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521015000/http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/dcp/news/king-kong/43148 |date=May 21, 2013}} Retrieved: March 15, 2012</ref> An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality.\n\nAfter a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital, restoration utilizing [[4K resolution]] [[Image scanner|scanning]] was completed by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2005.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/articles/robertharris/harris102505.html \"Robert A.

The Haver commentary was preserved in full on the [[FilmStruck]] streaming service.\n\n''King Kong'' had numerous [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] releases of varying quality prior to receiving an official studio release on DVD. Those included a [[Turner Home Entertainment|Turner]] 60th anniversary edition in 1993 featuring a front cover which had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It also included the colorized version of the film and a 25-minute documentary, ''It Was Beauty Killed the Beast'' (1992). The documentary is also available on two different UK ''King Kong'' DVDs, while the colorized version is available on DVD in the UK and Italy.<ref>[http://dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=2930 DVDCompare.com: ''King Kong'' (1933)] Retrieved: April 8, 2012</ref> [[Warner Home Video]] re-released the black and white version on VHS with the 25-minute documentary included under the ''Warner Bros. Classics'' label in 1999.\n\nIn 2005 [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]] released their digital restoration of ''King Kong'' in a US 2-disc Special Edition DVD, coinciding with the theatrical release of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[King Kong (2005 film)|remake]]. It had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by [[visual effects]] artists [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Ken Ralston]], with archival excerpts from actress [[Fay Wray]] and producer/director [[Merian C. Cooper]]. Warners issued identical DVDs in 2006 in Australia and New Zealand, followed by a US digibook-packaged Blu-ray in 2010.<ref>[http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/dvdcompare/kingkong.htm DVDBeaver.com ''King Kong'' comparison] Retrieved: June 14, 2015</ref> In 2014 the Blu-ray was repackaged with three unrelated films in a ''4 Film Favorites: Colossal Monster Collection''.\n\nAt present, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] holds worldwide rights to ''Kong'''s home video releases outside of North America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. All Universal's releases only contain their earlier, 100 minute, pre-2005 restoration.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, in the UK, Warner Home Video released the film digitally and on Blu-Ray and DVD in early 2017. The Blu-Ray contained the same contents as the  US release, but unfortunately for the DVD, that was based on the first Disc of the 2-Disc DVD release.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe 1933 ''King Kong'' film and character inspired imitations and installments. ''[[Son of Kong]]'', a direct sequel to the 1933 film was released nine months after the first film's release. In the early 1960s, RKO had licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio [[Toho]] and produced two King Kong films, ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (a crossover with the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' series]]) and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', both directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]].\n\nIn 1976, Italian producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] released his version of [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], a modern remake of the 1933 film, which was followed by a sequel in 1986 titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]''. In 2005, [[Universal Pictures]] released another remake of [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'']], directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] released a Kong reboot film titled ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' in 2017 which was directed by [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]] and is the second installment of a shared universe called the [[MonsterVerse]], which started with Legendary's reboot of '' [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Speculative fiction/Horror|United States}}\n* [[List of films featuring giant monsters]]\n* [[List of stop motion films]]\n* [[1933 in film]]\n* [[List of highest-grossing films]]\n* [[Skull Island]]\n* ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930)\n* ''[[Stark Mad]]'' (1929)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web |author=American Film Institute |author-link=American Film Institute |date=June 17, 2008 |title=AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres |url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 |accessdate=February 20, 2010}}\n*Annette, Kuhn.

Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

These specials (except for the special sports edition) were not taped in front of a live studio audience, with pre-recorded applause and laugh tracks were used during commercial bumpers and just before, during, and after video packages being used instead.\n\n===2001\u20132015: Tom Bergeron===\nIn October 2000, ABC announced its decision to return ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' as a regular weekly series, ordering 13 new episodes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120630/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4571525.html \"America's Funniest' to return\"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', October 27, 2000. Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail. Except for reruns of episodes from seasons 21 and 22 that referenced uploading to ABC.com, the re-edited season 11\u201320 episodes that used to originally reference ABC.com on the unaltered versions of the episodes reference uploading to AFV.com. \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Salute To...\" were discontinued after season 29; the completion of Alfonso Ribiero's first four years as AFV host.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-174845414.html \"America's Funniest Videos Takes Submission Via Internet\"]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [[PR Newswire]], February 15, 2008.

In the final six seasons of Bergeron's run as host, the show started its \"Funny Since 1989\" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, with Saget returning to ''AFV'' for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling.

Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on September 13, 2015) and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019.

This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009.

The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html McClellan, Steve. \"MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', October 3, 1994. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"contestrules\">https://www.afv.com/contest-rules</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues.

Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

While Fugelsang has not been seen in new recent never-before-seen footage on the road or in the studio on ''AFV'' since leaving the show in May 1999 after only two years co-hosting it together, Fuentes made a few brief cameo appearances in interview segments likely taking place at her house speaking on behalf of her and Fugelsang (and AFV; especially during their tenure) on the \"AFV: America...

Hughley]] and ''[[Spin City]]'' co-star [[Richard Kind]]. The show moved to a much smaller [[soundstage]] and the set featured various video screens and monitors (resembling iMac computers) placed on shelves. A special sports version of the show called ''AFV: The Sports Edition,'' that was hosted by [[ESPN]] anchor [[Stuart Scott]], was rebroadcast every [[New Year's Day]] and aired occasionally before [[NBA playoff]] games with a post 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time tip-off until 2008. A special entitled ''America's Funniest Home Videos: Deluxe Uncensored'' (which was released only on home video and featured somewhat more risque content than that allowed on the television broadcasts) was hosted by [[Steve Carell]] and taped on the set used from the 1998\u201399 season.

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, with Saget returning to ''AFV'' for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling.

Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html McClellan, Steve. \"MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', October 3, 1994. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
