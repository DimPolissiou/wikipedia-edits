The Warrior was hit by multiple [[rocket propelled grenade]]s, causing damage and resulting in the loss of radio communications. The platoon commander, the vehicle\u2019s gunner and a number of other soldiers in the vehicle were injured. Due to damage to his periscope optics, Pte. Beharry was forced to open his hatch to steer his vehicle, exposing his face and head to withering small arms fire. Beharry drove the crippled Warrior through the ambush, taking his own crew and leading five other Warriors to safety. He then extracted his wounded comrades from the vehicle, all the time exposed to further enemy fire. He was cited on this occasion for ''\"valour of the highest order\"''.\n\nWhile back on duty on 11 June 2004, Beharry was again driving the lead Warrior of his platoon through Al Amarah when his vehicle was ambushed. A rocket propelled grenade hit the vehicle six inches from Beharry's head, and he received serious [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] injuries to his face and brain. Other rockets then hit the vehicle, incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew. Despite his life-threatening injuries, Beharry retained control of his vehicle and drove it out of the ambush area before losing consciousness. He required [[brain surgery]] for his head injuries, and he was still recovering in March 2005 when he was awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\n===Citation and first living recipient in over 30 years===\nThe full citation was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' of 18 March 2005 and commented, \"Private Beharry carried out two individual acts of great heroism by which he saved the lives of his comrades.

Both were in direct face of the enemy, under intense fire, at great personal risk to himself (one leading to him sustaining very serious injuries). His valour is worthy of the highest recognition.\nIn the early hours of May 1, 2004 Beharry's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of Al Amarah. He was the driver of a platoon commander's warrior armoured fighting vehicle. His platoon was the company's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move.\n\nAs the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment, they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack. Beharry's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company, who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol.\n\nAs his platoon passed a roundabout, en route to the pinned-down patrol, they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead. The platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt, so that he could assess the situation. The vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nEyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions, which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior. As a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire, both the platoon commander and the vehicle's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds, and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded.\n\nDue to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle's radio systems, Beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him. He did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive, or how serious their injuries may be.\n\nIn this confusing and dangerous situation, on his own initiative, he closed his driver's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications, halting just short of a barricade placed across the road. The vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle.\n\nFurther damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick, noxious smoke. Beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation. He still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative, as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night.\n\nHe assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through, out of the ambush. He drove his warrior directly through the barricade, not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle. By doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety.\n\nAs the smoke in his driver's tunnel cleared, he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him. He pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand, whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other. However, the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip, and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him, down the driver's tunnel, further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret.\n\nThe impact of this rocket destroyed Beharry's armoured periscope, so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route, some 1500m long, with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire, all the time with no communications with any other vehicle. During this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.\n\nWhile his head remained out of the hatch, to enable him to see the route ahead, he was directly exposed to much of this fire, and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet, which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface. Despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire Beharry continued to push through the extended ambush, still leading his platoon until he broke clean.\n\nHe then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of Al Amarah to the outside of the Cimic House outpost, which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area. Once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside, without thought for his own personal safety, he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and, seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire, manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret, off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior.\n\nHe then returned once again to his vehicle and again mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicle's gunner and move him to a position of safety. Exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety.\n\nRemounting his burning vehicle for the third time, he drove it through a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost, thus denying it to the enemy.\n\nOnly at this stage did Beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles, immobilising the engine of the vehicle, dismounted and then moved himself into the relative safety of the back of another warrior. Once inside Beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated.\n\nHaving returned to duty following medical treatment, on June 11, 2004 Beharry's warrior was part of a quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off a mortar team that had attacked a coalition force base in Al Amarah. As the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city streets towards the suspected firing point, when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from a series of rooftop positions.\n\nDuring this initial heavy weight of enemy fire, a rocket-propelled grenade detonated on the vehicle's frontal armour, just six inches [15cm] from Beharry's head, resulting in a serious head injury. Other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehicle, incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew.\n\nWith the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision, Beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle, and forcefully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area. The vehicle continued to move until it struck the wall of a nearby building and came to rest. Beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds.\n\nBy moving the vehicle out of the enemy's chosen killing area he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle, with a greatly reduced risk from incoming fire.\n\nDespite receiving a serious head injury, which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in a coma for some time, his level-headed actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment.\n\nBeharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour, despite intense direct attacks, personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/18/iraq.military1|title=Private Beharry's Victoria Cross citation|date=18 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>}}\n\nBeharry is the first recipient of the Victoria Cross since the [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] awards to Lieutenant Colonel [[H.

The Warrior was hit by multiple [[rocket propelled grenade]]s, causing damage and resulting in the loss of radio communications. The platoon commander, the vehicle\u2019s gunner and a number of other soldiers in the vehicle were injured. Due to damage to his periscope optics, Pte. Beharry was forced to open his hatch to steer his vehicle, exposing his face and head to withering small arms fire. Beharry drove the crippled Warrior through the ambush, taking his own crew and leading five other Warriors to safety. He then extracted his wounded comrades from the vehicle, all the time exposed to further enemy fire. He was cited on this occasion for ''\"valour of the highest order\"''.\n\nWhile back on duty on 11 June 2004, Beharry was again driving the lead Warrior of his platoon through Al Amarah when his vehicle was ambushed. A rocket propelled grenade hit the vehicle six inches from Beharry's head, and he received serious [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] injuries to his face and brain. Other rockets then hit the vehicle, incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew. Despite his life-threatening injuries, Beharry retained control of his vehicle and drove it out of the ambush area before losing consciousness. He required [[brain surgery]] for his head injuries, and he was still recovering in March 2005 when he was awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\n===Citation and first living recipient in over 30 years===\nThe full citation was published in a supplement to the ''[[London Gazette]]'' of 18 March 2005 and commented, \"Private Beharry carried out two individual acts of great heroism by which he saved the lives of his comrades.

Both were in direct face of the enemy, under intense fire, at great personal risk to himself (one leading to him sustaining very serious injuries). His valour is worthy of the highest recognition.\nIn the early hours of May 1, 2004 Beharry's company was ordered to replenish an isolated coalition forces outpost located in the centre of the troubled city of Al Amarah. He was the driver of a platoon commander's warrior armoured fighting vehicle. His platoon was the company's reserve force and was placed on immediate notice to move.\n\nAs the main elements of his company were moving into the city to carry out the replenishment, they were re-tasked to fight through a series of enemy ambushes in order to extract a foot patrol that had become pinned down under sustained small arms and heavy machine gun fire and improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attack. Beharry's platoon was tasked over the radio to come to the assistance of the remainder of the company, who were attempting to extract the isolated foot patrol.\n\nAs his platoon passed a roundabout, en route to the pinned-down patrol, they became aware that the road to the front was empty of all civilians and traffic - an indicator of a potential ambush ahead. The platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt, so that he could assess the situation. The vehicle was then immediately hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nEyewitnesses report that the vehicle was engulfed in a number of violent explosions, which physically rocked the 30-tonne warrior. As a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire, both the platoon commander and the vehicle's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds, and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded.\n\nDue to damage sustained in the blast to the vehicle's radio systems, Beharry had no means of communication with either his turret crew or any of the other warrior vehicles deployed around him. He did not know if his commander or crewmen were still alive, or how serious their injuries may be.\n\nIn this confusing and dangerous situation, on his own initiative, he closed his driver's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications, halting just short of a barricade placed across the road. The vehicle was hit again by sustained rocket-propelled grenade attack from insurgent fighters in the alleyways and on rooftops around his vehicle.\n\nFurther damage to the warrior from these explosions caused it to catch fire and fill rapidly with thick, noxious smoke. Beharry opened up his armoured hatch cover to clear his view and orientate himself to the situation. He still had no radio communications and was now acting on his own initiative, as the lead vehicle of a six warrior convoy in an enemy-controlled area of the city at night.\n\nHe assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through, out of the ambush. He drove his warrior directly through the barricade, not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle. By doing this he was able to lead the remaining five warriors behind him towards safety.\n\nAs the smoke in his driver's tunnel cleared, he was just able to make out the shape of another rocket-propelled grenade in flight heading directly towards him. He pulled the heavy armoured hatch down with one hand, whilst still controlling his vehicle with the other. However, the overpressure from the explosion of the rocket wrenched the hatch out of his grip, and the flames and force of the blast passed directly over him, down the driver's tunnel, further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret.\n\nThe impact of this rocket destroyed Beharry's armoured periscope, so he was forced to drive the vehicle through the remainder of the ambushed route, some 1500m long, with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire, all the time with no communications with any other vehicle. During this long surge through the ambushes the vehicle was again struck by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.\n\nWhile his head remained out of the hatch, to enable him to see the route ahead, he was directly exposed to much of this fire, and was himself hit by a 7.62mm bullet, which penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface. Despite this harrowing weight of incoming fire Beharry continued to push through the extended ambush, still leading his platoon until he broke clean.\n\nHe then visually identified another warrior from his company and followed it through the streets of Al Amarah to the outside of the Cimic House outpost, which was receiving small arms fire from the surrounding area. Once he had brought his vehicle to a halt outside, without thought for his own personal safety, he climbed onto the turret of the still-burning vehicle and, seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire, manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret, off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby warrior.\n\nHe then returned once again to his vehicle and again mounted the exposed turret to lift out the vehicle's gunner and move him to a position of safety. Exposing himself yet again to enemy fire he returned to the rear of the burning vehicle to lead the disorientated and shocked dismounts and casualties to safety.\n\nRemounting his burning vehicle for the third time, he drove it through a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost, thus denying it to the enemy.\n\nOnly at this stage did Beharry pull the fire extinguisher handles, immobilising the engine of the vehicle, dismounted and then moved himself into the relative safety of the back of another warrior. Once inside Beharry collapsed from the sheer physical and mental exhaustion of his efforts and was subsequently himself evacuated.\n\nHaving returned to duty following medical treatment, on June 11, 2004 Beharry's warrior was part of a quick reaction force tasked to attempt to cut off a mortar team that had attacked a coalition force base in Al Amarah. As the lead vehicle of the platoon he was moving rapidly through the dark city streets towards the suspected firing point, when his vehicle was ambushed by the enemy from a series of rooftop positions.\n\nDuring this initial heavy weight of enemy fire, a rocket-propelled grenade detonated on the vehicle's frontal armour, just six inches [15cm] from Beharry's head, resulting in a serious head injury. Other rockets struck the turret and sides of the vehicle, incapacitating his commander and injuring several of the crew.\n\nWith the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision, Beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle, and forcefully reversed the warrior out of the ambush area. The vehicle continued to move until it struck the wall of a nearby building and came to rest. Beharry then lost consciousness as a result of his wounds.\n\nBy moving the vehicle out of the enemy's chosen killing area he enabled other warrior crews to be able to extract his crew from his vehicle, with a greatly reduced risk from incoming fire.\n\nDespite receiving a serious head injury, which later saw him being listed as very seriously injured and in a coma for some time, his level-headed actions in the face of heavy and accurate enemy fire at short range again almost certainly saved the lives of his crew and provided the conditions for their safe evacuation to medical treatment.\n\nBeharry displayed repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valour, despite intense direct attacks, personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/18/iraq.military1|title=Private Beharry's Victoria Cross citation|date=18 March 2005|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>}}\n\nBeharry is the first recipient of the Victoria Cross since the [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] awards to Lieutenant Colonel [[H.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers [[James McAuley]] and [[Harold Stewart]] in order to hoax members of the [[Angry Penguins]], a [[modernism|modernist]] art and literary movement centered around a journal of the same name, co-edited by poet [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]] and art patron [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]], of [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|Heide]], [[Melbourne]].\n\nImitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and mailed sixteen poems to Harris under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister. Harris and other members of the [[Heide Circle]] fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of ''Angry Penguins'' to Malley, hailing him as a genius. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. ''Angry Penguins'' folded in 1946.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of [[surrealist poetry]] in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as [[John Ashbery]], [[Kenneth Koch]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]. The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators, and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists, such as [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] and [[Sidney Nolan]]. American poet and anthologist [[David Lehman]] called Ern Malley \"the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century\".<ref name=lehman />\n\n== Background ==\nJames McAuley and Harold Stewart were both, in 1944, in the Army [[Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs]]. Before the war they had been part of Sydney's [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] arts world. McAuley had acted and sung in [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[revue]]s at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]]. Both preferred early [[Modernism]] to its later forms. McAuley, for example, claimed that [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' (1917) was genius, but that the subsequent ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), regarded by many as Eliot's finest achievement, was an incoherent mess.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Both men lamented \"the loss of meaning and craftsmanship\" in poetry. They particularly despised the well-funded [[modernism|modernist]] poetry magazine ''Angry Penguins'' and were resentful of the precocious success of [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]], the magazine's founder and editor.\n\nHarris was a 22-year-old ''[[avant-garde]]'' poet and critic in [[Adelaide]], who in 1940, at the age of 18, had started ''Angry Penguins''.<ref name=Malley>{{cite book |last=Malley |first=Ern |title=The Darkening Ecliptic |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Green Integer]] |date=2017 |isbn=978-1-55713-439-4}}</ref>\n\n== Creating the hoax ==\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = James McAuley poet.jpg\n | caption1  = James McAuley, 1944\n | image2    = Harold Stewart poet.jpg\n | caption2  = Harold Stewart, 1944\n}}\nMcAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and ''Angry Penguins'' by submitting to the magazine nonsensical poetry, which they felt captured the worst of modernist tendencies, under the guise of a fictional poet. They came up with a fictional biography for the poet \"Ernest Lalor Malley\", who, they claimed, had died the year before at the age of 25. The name is a \"highly Australian-sounding handle\": \"Malley\" is a pun on the word ''[[Mallee (habit)|mallee]]'', denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird, the native [[malleefowl]], and \"Lalor\" recalls [[Peter Lalor]], leader of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]].<ref>Heyward, 1993, p. xv.</ref> Then, in one afternoon, they wrote his entire body of work: 17 poems, none longer than a page, and all intended to be read in sequence under the title ''The Darkening Ecliptic''.\n\nTheir writing style, as they described it, was to write down the first thing that came into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', a ''Collected Shakespeare'', and a ''Dictionary of Quotations'': \"We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions.

His father died in 1920, and Malley's mother migrated to [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]], a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother's death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with [[Graves' disease]] sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23&nbsp;July of that same year.\n\nMalley's life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them.  Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them.<ref>Documentation of Ethel's action and other sources can be viewed online at the [http://jacketmagazine.com/17/index.shtml Ern Malley Feature], ''[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]'' (Sydney), No. 7, June 2002, ed. [[John Tranter]]</ref> Max Harris of ''Angry Penguins'' was to be that someone.\n\n== Carrying out the hoax ==\nMcAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter, purported to be from Ethel, containing the poems, and asking for his opinion of her late brother's work.\n\nHarris read the poems with, as he later recalled, a mounting sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet in the same class as [[W. H. Auden]] or [[Dylan Thomas]]. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of ''Angry Penguins'' and commissioned a painting by [[Sidney Nolan]], based on the poems, for the cover.<ref name=Malley />\n\nThe \"Autumn 1944\" edition of ''Angry Penguins'' appeared in June 1944 owing to wartime printing delays.<ref>Michael Heywood, ''The Ern Malley Affair'', p.77</ref> Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics. The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected. An article appeared in the [[University of Adelaide]] student newspaper ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax.\n\n== The hoax revealed ==\n[[File:Max Harris Joy Hester.jpg|thumb|Max Harris with Angry Penguins artist [[Joy Hester]]]]\nOn 17 June, the Adelaide ''Daily Mail'' raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney ''Sunday Sun'', which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article231696143 |title=Ern Malley, the great poet, or the greatest hoax? |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=2151 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 June 1944 |accessdate=17 October 2017 |page=1 (Supplement To The Sunday Sun And Guardian) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe South Australian police impounded the issue of ''Angry Penguins'' devoted to ''The Darkening Ecliptic'' on the grounds that Malley's poems were obscene.<ref name=lehman>Lehman D 1998 ''[http://jacketmagazine.com/17/ern-dl.html The Ern Malley Poetry Hoax \u2013 Introduction]'' in Jacket No 17</ref>\n\nThe Ern Malley hoax was on the front pages of the newspapers for weeks, and Harris was humiliated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAfter the hoax was revealed, McAuley and Stewart wrote:\n<blockquote>Mr. Max Harris and other ''Angry Penguins'' writers represent an Australian outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be ''intellectuals'' and ''Bohemians'', both here and abroad, as ''great poetry''. [...] However, it was possible that we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McAuley|first1=James|last2=Stewart|first2=Harold|title=Ern Malley, Poet of Debunk: full story from the two authors|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/17/fact2.html|work=Fact|date=25 June 1944}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Immediate impact ==\nThe South Australian police prosecuted Harris for publishing immoral and obscene material. The only prosecution witness was a police detective, whose evidence is full of unintended humour: \"Another evidence of indecency was the word 'incestuous'. Detective Volgelsang said: 'I don't know what \"incestuous\" means, but I think there is a suggestion of indecency about it'\". Despite the woeful case, and several distinguished expert witnesses arguing for Harris, he was found guilty and fined \u00a35.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collected Poems: Ern Malley |publisher=Angus & Robertson Childrens |isbn=0207179778 |edition=1993 }}</ref>\n\n''Angry Penguins'' soon folded, although the magazine's demise had more to do with a libel case brought against Harris for an unconnected review and the emotional fallout from events in the open marriage of its backers [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] and his wife, [[Sunday Reed|Sunday]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nMost people, including most educated people with an interest in the arts, were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart's \"experiment.\" The two had deliberately written bad poetry, passed it off under a plausible alias to the country's most prominent publisher of modernist poetry, and completely taken him in. Harris, they said, could not tell real poetry from fake, good from bad.\n\nThe Ern Malley hoax had long-lasting repercussions. To quote the ''Oxford Companion to Australian Literature'', \"More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry. The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing, espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the ''Angry Penguins'' group, received a severe setback, and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ern Malley Hoax |encyclopedia=Oxford Companion to Australian Literature |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor1-first=William H. |editor1-last=Wilde |editor2-first=Joy |editor2-last=Hooton |editor3-first=Barry |editor3-last=Andrews |page=257 |isbn=9780195533811 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195533811.001.0001/acref-9780195533811-e-1133?rskey=cPh5if&result=1133}}</ref>\n\nControversy over Ern Malley continued for more than twenty years. It spread beyond Australia when it was learned that the British literary critic [[Herbert Read]] had been taken in by the hoax.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Modernist novelists like [[Patrick White]] and abstract painters found themselves tarred with the Ern Malley brush.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Since both McAuley and Stewart and the left-wing nationalist school around [[Vance Palmer|Vance]] and [[Nettie Palmer]] disliked the ''Angry Penguins'' version of modernism with equal venom, though for different reasons, Ern Malley cast a long shadow over Australian cultural life.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nIn a 1975 interview with [[Earle Hackett]], Sidney Nolan credited Ern Malley with inspiring him to paint his first [[Ned Kelly]] series (1946\u201347), saying \"It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object.\"<ref name=\"nolan\" />\n\n== McAuley, Stewart and Harris in later years ==\nMcAuley went on to publish several volumes of poetry and, with [[Richard Krygier]], founded the literary and cultural journal [[Quadrant (magazine)|''Quadrant'']].

He died in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nHarris, however, once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, made the best of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called ''Ern Malley's Journal''. In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had ''intended'' to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. His political views moved significantly to the right as he got older (he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hoax), and in the mid-1960s, he claimed to sympathise with McAuley and Stewart's motivations in creating Ern Malley{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Harris died in 1995.\n\n== Subsequent re-appreciation ==\nThe fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity. The poems are regularly re-published and quoted. There have been at least 20 publications of the ''Darkening Ecliptic'', either complete or partial. It has reappeared \u2013 not only in Australia, but in London, Paris, Lyons, Kyoto, New York and Los Angeles \u2013 with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet.<ref name=\"malley\">Rainey, David.

Harris, of course, had a vested interest in Malley, but others have agreed with his assessment. [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The basic case made by Ern's defenders was that his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued on behalf of all the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt our culture.{{Cite quote|date=May 2009}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the \"Individual Notes on Works and Authors\" in the \"Special Collaborations Issue\" of [[Locus Solus (journal)|Locus Solus]], [[Kenneth Koch]] wrote, \"Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley 'was' (if one can use that word here), I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley's poetry.\"\n\nThe American poet [[John Ashbery]] said of Ern Malley, in a 1988 interview in the magazine ''[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]'':\n<blockquote>I think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry \u2013 which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then \u2013 and they had the original edition of ''The Darkening Ecliptic'' with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry \u2013 of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time \u2013 and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course [at [[Brooklyn College]], NY], which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem \u2013 frequently one of [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud...

He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers [[James McAuley]] and [[Harold Stewart]] in order to hoax members of the [[Angry Penguins]], a [[modernism|modernist]] art and literary movement centered around a journal of the same name, co-edited by poet [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]] and art patron [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]], of [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|Heide]], [[Melbourne]]. \n\nImitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and mailed sixteen poems to Harris under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister. Harris and other members of the [[Heide Circle]] fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of ''Angry Penguins'' to Malley, hailing him as a genius. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. ''Angry Penguins'' folded in 1946.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of [[surrealist poetry]] in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as [[John Ashbery]], [[Kenneth Koch]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]. The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators, and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists, such as [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] and [[Sidney Nolan]]. American poet and anthologist [[David Lehman]] called Ern Malley \"the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century\".<ref name=lehman />\n\n== Background ==\nJames McAuley and Harold Stewart were both, in 1944, in the Army [[Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs]]. Before the war they had been part of Sydney's [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] arts world. McAuley had acted and sung in [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[revue]]s at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]]. Both preferred early [[Modernism]] to its later forms. McAuley, for example, claimed that [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]'' (1917) was genius, but that the subsequent ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), regarded by many as Eliot's finest achievement, was an incoherent mess.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Both men lamented \"the loss of meaning and craftsmanship\" in poetry. They particularly despised the well-funded [[modernism|modernist]] poetry magazine ''Angry Penguins'' and were resentful of the precocious success of [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]], the magazine's founder and editor.\n\nHarris was a 22-year-old ''[[avant-garde]]'' poet and critic in [[Adelaide]], who in 1940, at the age of 18, had started ''Angry Penguins''.<ref name=Malley>{{cite book |last=Malley |first=Ern |title=The Darkening Ecliptic |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Green Integer]] |date=2017 |isbn=978-1-55713-439-4}}</ref>\n\n== Creating the hoax ==\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = James McAuley poet.jpg\n | caption1  = James McAuley, 1944\n | image2    = Harold Stewart poet.jpg\n | caption2  = Harold Stewart, 1944\n}}\nMcAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and ''Angry Penguins'' by submitting to the magazine nonsensical poetry, which they felt captured the worst of modernist tendencies, under the guise of a fictional poet. They came up with a fictional biography for the poet \"Ernest Lalor Malley\", who, they claimed, had died the year before at the age of 25. The name is a \"highly Australian-sounding handle\": \"Malley\" is a pun on the word ''[[Mallee (habit)|mallee]]'', denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird, the native [[malleefowl]], and \"Lalor\" recalls [[Peter Lalor]], leader of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]].<ref>Heyward, 1993, p. xv.</ref> Then, in one afternoon, they wrote his entire body of work: 17 poems, none longer than a page, and all intended to be read in sequence under the title ''The Darkening Ecliptic''.\n\nTheir writing style, as they described it, was to write down the first thing that came into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', a ''Collected Shakespeare'', and a ''Dictionary of Quotations'': \"We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions.

His father died in 1920, and Malley's mother migrated to [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]], a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother's death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with [[Graves' disease]] sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23&nbsp;July of that same year.\n\nMalley's life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them.  Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them.<ref>Documentation of Ethel's action and other sources can be viewed online at the [http://jacketmagazine.com/17/index.shtml Ern Malley Feature], ''[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]'' (Sydney), No. 7, June 2002, ed. [[John Tranter]]</ref> Max Harris of ''Angry Penguins'' was to be that someone.\n\n== Carrying out the hoax ==\nMcAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter, purported to be from Ethel, containing the poems, and asking for his opinion of her late brother's work.\n\nHarris read the poems with, as he later recalled, a mounting sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet in the same class as [[W. H. Auden]] or [[Dylan Thomas]]. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of ''Angry Penguins'' and commissioned a painting by [[Sidney Nolan]], based on the poems, for the cover.<ref name=Malley />\n\nThe \"Autumn 1944\" edition of ''Angry Penguins'' appeared in June 1944 owing to wartime printing delays.<ref>Michael Heywood, ''The Ern Malley Affair'', p.77</ref> Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics. The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected. An article appeared in the [[University of Adelaide]] student newspaper ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax.\n\n== The hoax revealed ==\n[[File:Max Harris Joy Hester.jpg|thumb|Max Harris with Angry Penguins artist [[Joy Hester]]]]\nOn 17 June, the Adelaide ''Daily Mail'' raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney ''Sunday Sun'', which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article231696143 |title=Ern Malley, the great poet, or the greatest hoax? |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=2151 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 June 1944 |accessdate=17 October 2017 |page=1 (Supplement To The Sunday Sun And Guardian) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe South Australian police impounded the issue of ''Angry Penguins'' devoted to ''The Darkening Ecliptic'' on the grounds that Malley's poems were obscene.<ref name=lehman>Lehman D 1998 ''[http://jacketmagazine.com/17/ern-dl.html The Ern Malley Poetry Hoax \u2013 Introduction]'' in Jacket No 17</ref>\n\nThe Ern Malley hoax was on the front pages of the newspapers for weeks, and Harris was humiliated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAfter the hoax was revealed, McAuley and Stewart wrote:\n<blockquote>Mr. Max Harris and other ''Angry Penguins'' writers represent an Australian outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be ''intellectuals'' and ''Bohemians'', both here and abroad, as ''great poetry''. [...] However, it was possible that we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McAuley|first1=James|last2=Stewart|first2=Harold|title=Ern Malley, Poet of Debunk: full story from the two authors|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/17/fact2.html|work=Fact|date=25 June 1944}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Immediate impact ==\nThe South Australian police prosecuted Harris for publishing immoral and obscene material. The only prosecution witness was a police detective, whose evidence is full of unintended humour: \"Another evidence of indecency was the word 'incestuous'. Detective Volgelsang said: 'I don't know what \"incestuous\" means, but I think there is a suggestion of indecency about it'\". Despite the woeful case, and several distinguished expert witnesses arguing for Harris, he was found guilty and fined \u00a35.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collected Poems: Ern Malley |publisher=Angus & Robertson Childrens |isbn=0207179778 |edition=1993 }}</ref>\n\n''Angry Penguins'' soon folded, although the magazine's demise had more to do with a libel case brought against Harris for an unconnected review and the emotional fallout from events in the open marriage of its backers [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] and his wife, [[Sunday Reed|Sunday]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nMost people, including most educated people with an interest in the arts, were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart's \"experiment.\" The two had deliberately written bad poetry, passed it off under a plausible alias to the country's most prominent publisher of modernist poetry, and completely taken him in. Harris, they said, could not tell real poetry from fake, good from bad.\n\nThe Ern Malley hoax had long-lasting repercussions. To quote the ''Oxford Companion to Australian Literature'', \"More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry. The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing, espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the ''Angry Penguins'' group, received a severe setback, and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ern Malley Hoax |encyclopedia=Oxford Companion to Australian Literature |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor1-first=William H. |editor1-last=Wilde |editor2-first=Joy |editor2-last=Hooton |editor3-first=Barry |editor3-last=Andrews |page=257 |isbn=9780195533811 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195533811.001.0001/acref-9780195533811-e-1133?rskey=cPh5if&result=1133}}</ref>\n\nControversy over Ern Malley continued for more than twenty years.

He died in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nHarris, however, once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, made the best of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called ''Ern Malley's Journal''. In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had ''intended'' to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. His political views moved significantly to the right as he got older (he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hoax), and in the mid-1960s, he claimed to sympathise with McAuley and Stewart's motivations in creating Ern Malley{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Harris died in 1995.\n\n== Subsequent re-appreciation ==\nThe fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity. The poems are regularly re-published and quoted. There have been at least 20 publications of the ''Darkening Ecliptic'', either complete or partial. It has reappeared \u2013 not only in Australia, but in London, Paris, Lyons, Kyoto, New York and Los Angeles \u2013 with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet.<ref name=\"malley\">Rainey, David.

Harris, of course, had a vested interest in Malley, but others have agreed with his assessment. [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The basic case made by Ern's defenders was that his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued on behalf of all the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt our culture.{{Cite quote|date=May 2009}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the \"Individual Notes on Works and Authors\" in the \"Special Collaborations Issue\" of [[Locus Solus (journal)|Locus Solus]], [[Kenneth Koch]] wrote, \"Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley 'was' (if one can use that word here), I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley's poetry.\"\n\nThe American poet [[John Ashbery]] said of Ern Malley, in a 1988 interview in the magazine ''[[Jacket (magazine)|Jacket]]'':\n<blockquote>I think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry \u2013 which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then \u2013 and they had the original edition of ''The Darkening Ecliptic'' with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry \u2013 of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time \u2013 and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course [at [[Brooklyn College]], NY], which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem \u2013 frequently one of [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud...

With close to five hundred published [[books]], he is one of the most prolific authors in the United States,<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|title=Library of Congress Online Catalog: Don Nardo|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=don+nardo&Search_Code=NAME%40&CNT=100&hist=1&type=quick|publisher=United States Library of Congress}}</ref> and one of the country's foremost writers of historical works for children and teens.<ref name=\"VDH'sPP\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nDon Nardo was born in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], Missouri.\n\nWith his younger brother, Philip (born 1949), Nardo spent the first few years of his life on the road as his parents, who were popular nightclub entertainers that traveled throughout the country.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the family settled in [[Natick]], [[Massachusetts]], where Nardo was at first home-schooled, but he later attended the local public schools.  As he grew older, he developed an interest in many of the fields he would later pursue professionally, including acting, music, history, and writing.  In high school, he performed in numerous plays and was voted best actor in his senior class.<ref name=\"Natick\">{{Cite book|title=Sassamon|last=Natick High School|date=June 1965|location=Natick, MA|page=193}}</ref> Outside of school, he learned to play the trumpet and began composing chamber and orchestral music, including a four-movement symphony at age fourteen.<ref name=\"NPbio\">{{Cite web|title=Don Nardo: Composer, Historian, Author, Screenwriter|url=http://www.nardopublishing.com/?page_id=106|date=November 25, 2008}}</ref> However, having little formal musical training, he was initially unable to notate these pieces properly, so in the next few years he taught himself to do so by studying books on orchestration.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Nardo majored in theater at [[Syracuse University]], but left after a few [[semesters]] to pursue an acting career in New York City.<ref name=\"CapeCod1\">{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Barbara A.|title=This Renaissance Man Turned Desire into Reality|publisher=Cape Cod News|date=February 24, 1988|page=6}}</ref> Later, in the 1970s, he returned to school, graduating magna cum laude with a degree in history from Worcester State College (now [[Worcester State University]]).<ref name=\"AnHis\">{{Cite book|last=Kinzl|first=Konrad|title=Directory of Ancient Historians in the United States|publisher=Regina Books|location=Claremont, CA|year=1999|page=49}}</ref>\n\n===Early professional work===\n\nAs a young character actor, Nardo appeared in numerous stage productions, including work in summer stock in upstate New York and dinner theater in the American South.<ref name=\"CapeCod2\">{{Cite news|last=Crosby|first=Johanna|title=Cape Duo's 'Spenser' Script to Air Sunday|publisher=Cape Cod Times|date=December 31, 1987|page=15}}</ref> He also worked with the National Shakespeare Company under producer-director Philip Meister,<ref name=\"NYT1\">{{Cite news|title=Obituary for Philip Meister|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/05/arts/philip-meister-helped-start-cubiculo-theater.html|publisher=New York Times|date=April 5, 1982}}</ref> including productions of Macbeth, Othello, and As You Like It. Later, Nardo's theatrical interests shifted more to writing screenplays and teleplays. While working on his first few scripts, he taught high school social studies and English in Barnstable, Massachusetts.<ref name=\"barnstable\">{{Cite web|title=The Barnstable High School Drama Club History|url=http://bhsdc.org/site/?page_id=156}}</ref>  One of these screenplays, The Bet, won a $5,000 award from the Massachusetts Artists Foundation in 1982. Among the teleplays was an episode of ABC\u2019s [[Spenser: For Hire]], starring [[Robert Urich]]. Titled \"Skeletons in the Closet,\" it guest starred [[E.G. Marshall]] and [[Boyd Gaines]]. Nardo also co-wrote, produced and directed a low-budget feature film, In Deadly Heat, which was distributed as Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator by Troma Entertainment and released to the video market in 1990 by Media Home Entertainment.\n\n===Writing career===\n\nAlthough Nardo had avidly studied history informally since childhood and had acquired a degree in history in the 1970s, he did not begin writing history books until the 1980s.  A chance assignment by a Boston-based publisher to write several chapters of a new high-school-level history [[textbook]] led to offers from several young adult publishers.  In the years that followed, the offers kept coming, as did positive reviews from [[School Library Journal]],<ref name=\"SLJ\">{{Cite web|last1=Grabarek|first1=Daryl|last2=Thornton-Verma|first2=Henrietta|title=Reference Review|publisher=School Library Journal|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6448971.html|date=June 1, 2007}}</ref> [[Booklist]], and other noted journals. He joined the Association of Ancient Historians in the 1990s.<ref name=\"AnHis\" /> And by 2004, he had penned more than a hundred books about the [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylonians]], [[History of Iran|Persia]]ns, and other ancient peoples. In that same year, noted classical historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] stated online: \u201cThere is an entire series of great children\u2019s books [about ancient history] by Don Nardo, who has emerged as the premier practitioner of that important craft.\"<ref name=\"VDH'sPP\">Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers, August 2004. Retrieved 2009-06-06</ref>\nAt the request of [[Chelsea House]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Lucent Books]], [[Compass Point Books]], Morgan Reynolds, and other publishers, Nardo also wrote numerous books about medieval civilization, among them a biography of the eccentric Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] that won a special commendation by the [[National Science Teachers Association]].<ref name=\"NSTA\">{{Cite web|last=Texley|first=Julianna|title=Outstanding Science Trade Books for Students K\u201312: 2008|url=http://www.nsta.org/publications/ostb/ostb2008.aspx|publisher=National Science Teachers Association}}</ref> In addition, he fulfilled numerous requests to write books about modern history, including several studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]], America's wars, and the U.S. founders and their writings. His 2012 book Migrant Mother was nominated for numerous best book of the year awards and won the Spur Award for Best Western Juvenile Nonfiction,as well as citations from the Bank Street Children's Book Committee, the Midwest Independent Publishers Association, and the Pennsylvania School Librarians Association. Another 2012 volume, Destined for Space, won an award from the American Astronautical Society. Moreover, in September 2014, for the first time Nardo briefly switched his focus from nonfiction to fiction by publishing his first novel, titled Cloak of Destiny. He calls it a \"cosmic mystery.\" One of its main story lines, he says, deals with a modern archaeologist who \"has discovered an astonishing secret in the deserts of Israel, revealing some startling previously unknown truths about humankind\u2019s place in the universe.\" That excavator has \"no doubt in his mind\" that when the public finds out about these mind-bending discoveries, \"the world as people now know it will change forever.\"<ref name=\"NPbio\" />\n\n===Music===\n\nMeanwhile, Nardo continued to compose music, including three more symphonies; concertos for violin, cello, piano, clarinet, French horn, and trumpet; a double concerto for violin, cello, and orchestra; a piano trio; a piano sonata; four string quartets;<ref name=\"CapeCod1\" /> a musical tribute to [[Thomas Jefferson]]; incidental music for stage plays, including a large-scale school production of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', for which he also conducted the pit orchestra;<ref name=\"barnstable\" /> several romances arranged for strings or orchestra; an oratorio based on the [[King Arthur]] legends,<ref name=\"John White\">{{Cite news|last=White|first=John|title=Nardo Composes 'Arthur', Oratorio|publisher=Insight|date=March 17, 1981|page=7}}</ref> and other works.  In 1987 the [[Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Royston Nash]], commissioned him to compose a concert piece for children based on [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.<ref name=\"CapeCod1\" /> A more recent commission came in 2008 from Portuguese-American violinist [[Pedro Ferreira (violinist)|Pedro Ferreira]] \u2014 a double concerto for violin and Portuguese guitar, the first major concert piece ever written for the latter instrument.<ref name=\"Ferreira\">{{Cite web|last=Ferreira|first=Pedro|title=Pedro Ferreira: Bio|url=http://www.peterferreira.com}}</ref>  Between 2008 and 2010, Nardo was the resident composer and arranger for Ferreira\u2019s Connecticut-based Amadis Orchestra.<ref name=\"Ferreira\" />  Another commission from the Cape Cod Symphony, now under conductor [[Jung-Ho Pak]], came in 2011, part of the orchestra's 50th anniversary celebration. Titled ''Cape Cod Impressions'', the large-scale orchestral piece was accompanied by photos of the Cape projected onto huge screens and received standing ovations at all performances.<ref name=\"NPbio\" /> In 2013, Nardo completed another commission from Peter Ferreira, this time a set of more than a dozen orchestral arrangements of popular songs for a special pops concert in which Ferreira performed with Connecticut's Cheshire Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Richard Brooks.<ref>Harugari German Club [http://events.newstimes.com/west_haven_ct/events/show/329027383-cheshire-symphony-orchestra-with-peter-ferreira-and-ensemble \"Cheshire Symphony Orchestra with Peter Ferreira Ensemble\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006114028/http://events.newstimes.com/west_haven_ct/events/show/329027383-cheshire-symphony-orchestra-with-peter-ferreira-and-ensemble |date=October 6, 2014 }}, ''[[Newstimes.com]]'', 14 June 2013.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nNardo has been married twice.  The first union produced a son, Dana (born 1972), who became a graphic artist and animator.  Nardo and his second wife, Christine, are avid animal lovers who have a particular fondness for dogs and presently share their home in Massachusetts with a yellow lab named Daisy.<ref name=\"NPbio\" /> They also enjoy traveling and have made frequent trips to Greece and other countries that Nardo frequently writes about.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n*Krakatoa.

With close to five hundred published [[books]], he is one of the most prolific authors in the United States,<ref name=\"LoC\">{{cite web|title=Library of Congress Online Catalog: Don Nardo|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search_Arg=don+nardo&Search_Code=NAME%40&CNT=100&hist=1&type=quick|publisher=United States Library of Congress}}</ref> and one of the country's foremost writers of historical works for children and teens.<ref name=\"VDH'sPP\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nDon Nardo was born in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], Missouri.\n\nWith his younger brother, Philip (born 1949), Nardo spent the first few years of his life on the road as his parents, who were popular nightclub entertainers that traveled throughout the country.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the family settled in [[Natick]], [[Massachusetts]], where Nardo was at first home-schooled, but he later attended the local public schools.  As he grew older, he developed an interest in many of the fields he would later pursue professionally, including acting, music, history, and writing.  In high school, he performed in numerous plays and was voted best actor in his senior class.<ref name=\"Natick\">{{Cite book|title=Sassamon|last=Natick High School|date=June 1965|location=Natick, MA|page=193}}</ref> Outside of school, he learned to play the trumpet and began composing chamber and orchestral music, including a four-movement symphony at age fourteen.<ref name=\"NPbio\">{{Cite web|title=Don Nardo: Composer, Historian, Author, Screenwriter|url=http://www.nardopublishing.com/?page_id=106|date=November 25, 2008}}</ref> However, having little formal musical training, he was initially unable to notate these pieces properly, so in the next few years he taught himself to do so by studying books on orchestration.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Nardo majored in theater at [[Syracuse University]], but left after a few [[semesters]] to pursue an acting career in New York City.<ref name=\"CapeCod1\">{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Barbara A.|title=This Renaissance Man Turned Desire into Reality|publisher=Cape Cod News|date=February 24, 1988|page=6}}</ref> Later, in the 1970s, he returned to school, obtaining a degree in history from Worcester State College (and graduating magna cum laude).<ref name=\"AnHis\">{{Cite book|last=Kinzl|first=Konrad|title=Directory of Ancient Historians in the United States|publisher=Regina Books|location=Claremont, CA|year=1999|page=49}}</ref>\n\n===Early professional work===\n\nAs a young character actor, Nardo appeared in numerous stage productions, including work in summer stock in upstate New York and dinner theater in the American South.<ref name=\"CapeCod2\">{{Cite news|last=Crosby|first=Johanna|title=Cape Duo's 'Spenser' Script to Air Sunday|publisher=Cape Cod Times|date=December 31, 1987|page=15}}</ref> He also worked with the National Shakespeare Company under producer-director Philip Meister,<ref name=\"NYT1\">{{Cite news|title=Obituary for Philip Meister|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/05/arts/philip-meister-helped-start-cubiculo-theater.html|publisher=New York Times|date=April 5, 1982}}</ref> including productions of Macbeth, Othello, and As You Like It. Later, Nardo's theatrical interests shifted more to writing screenplays and teleplays. While working on his first few scripts, he taught high school social studies and English in Barnstable, Massachusetts.<ref name=\"barnstable\">{{Cite web|title=The Barnstable High School Drama Club History|url=http://bhsdc.org/site/?page_id=156}}</ref>  One of these screenplays, The Bet, won a $5,000 award from the Massachusetts Artists Foundation in 1982. Among the teleplays was an episode of ABC\u2019s [[Spenser: For Hire]], starring [[Robert Urich]]. Titled \"Skeletons in the Closet,\" it guest starred [[E.G. Marshall]] and [[Boyd Gaines]]. Nardo also co-wrote, produced and directed a low-budget feature film, In Deadly Heat, which was distributed as Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator by Troma Entertainment and released to the video market in 1990 by Media Home Entertainment.\n\n===Writing career===\n\nAlthough Nardo had avidly studied history informally since childhood and had acquired a degree in history in the 1970s, he did not begin writing history books until the 1980s.  A chance assignment by a Boston-based publisher to write several chapters of a new high-school-level history [[textbook]] led to offers from several young adult publishers.  In the years that followed, the offers kept coming, as did positive reviews from [[School Library Journal]],<ref name=\"SLJ\">{{Cite web|last1=Grabarek|first1=Daryl|last2=Thornton-Verma|first2=Henrietta|title=Reference Review|publisher=School Library Journal|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6448971.html|date=June 1, 2007}}</ref> [[Booklist]], and other noted journals. He joined the Association of Ancient Historians in the 1990s.<ref name=\"AnHis\" /> And by 2004, he had penned more than a hundred books about the [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]], [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylonians]], [[History of Iran|Persia]]ns, and other ancient peoples. In that same year, noted classical historian [[Victor Davis Hanson]] stated online: \u201cThere is an entire series of great children\u2019s books [about ancient history] by Don Nardo, who has emerged as the premier practitioner of that important craft.\"<ref name=\"VDH'sPP\">Victor Davis Hanson's Private Papers, August 2004. Retrieved 2009-06-06</ref>\nAt the request of [[Chelsea House]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Lucent Books]], [[Compass Point Books]], Morgan Reynolds, and other publishers, Nardo also wrote numerous books about medieval civilization, among them a biography of the eccentric Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] that won a special commendation by the [[National Science Teachers Association]].<ref name=\"NSTA\">{{Cite web|last=Texley|first=Julianna|title=Outstanding Science Trade Books for Students K\u201312: 2008|url=http://www.nsta.org/publications/ostb/ostb2008.aspx|publisher=National Science Teachers Association}}</ref> In addition, he fulfilled numerous requests to write books about modern history, including several studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]], America's wars, and the U.S. founders and their writings. His 2012 book Migrant Mother was nominated for numerous best book of the year awards and won the Spur Award for Best Western Juvenile Nonfiction,as well as citations from the Bank Street Children's Book Committee, the Midwest Independent Publishers Association, and the Pennsylvania School Librarians Association. Another 2012 volume, Destined for Space, won an award from the American Astronautical Society. Moreover, in September 2014, for the first time Nardo briefly switched his focus from nonfiction to fiction by publishing his first novel, titled Cloak of Destiny. He calls it a \"cosmic mystery.\" One of its main story lines, he says, deals with a modern archaeologist who \"has discovered an astonishing secret in the deserts of Israel, revealing some startling previously unknown truths about humankind\u2019s place in the universe.\" That excavator has \"no doubt in his mind\" that when the public finds out about these mind-bending discoveries, \"the world as people now know it will change forever.\"<ref name=\"NPbio\" />\n\n===Music===\n\nMeanwhile, Nardo continued to compose music, including three more symphonies; concertos for violin, cello, piano, clarinet, French horn, and trumpet; a double concerto for violin, cello, and orchestra; a piano trio; a piano sonata; four string quartets;<ref name=\"CapeCod1\" /> a musical tribute to [[Thomas Jefferson]]; incidental music for stage plays, including a large-scale school production of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', for which he also conducted the pit orchestra;<ref name=\"barnstable\" /> several romances arranged for strings or orchestra; an oratorio based on the [[King Arthur]] legends,<ref name=\"John White\">{{Cite news|last=White|first=John|title=Nardo Composes 'Arthur', Oratorio|publisher=Insight|date=March 17, 1981|page=7}}</ref> and other works.  In 1987 the [[Cape Cod Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Royston Nash]], commissioned him to compose a concert piece for children based on [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.<ref name=\"CapeCod1\" /> A more recent commission came in 2008 from Portuguese-American violinist [[Pedro Ferreira (violinist)|Pedro Ferreira]] \u2014 a double concerto for violin and Portuguese guitar, the first major concert piece ever written for the latter instrument.<ref name=\"Ferreira\">{{Cite web|last=Ferreira|first=Pedro|title=Pedro Ferreira: Bio|url=http://www.peterferreira.com}}</ref>  Between 2008 and 2010, Nardo was the resident composer and arranger for Ferreira\u2019s Connecticut-based Amadis Orchestra.<ref name=\"Ferreira\" />  Another commission from the Cape Cod Symphony, now under conductor [[Jung-Ho Pak]], came in 2011, part of the orchestra's 50th anniversary celebration.
