People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [[bias]]ed way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for [[emotion]]ally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched [[belief]]s.\n\nPeople also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).\n\nA series of [[Experimental psychology|psychological experiments]] in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include [[wishful thinking]] and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way. However, even scientists and intelligent people can be prone to confirmation bias.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Lee|first1=C.J.|last2=Sugimoto|first2=C.R.|last3=Zhang|first3=G.|last4=Cronin|first4=B.|year=2013|title=Bias in peer review|journal=J Am Soc Inf Sci Tec|volume=64|pages=2\u201317|doi=10.1002/asi.22784}}<br />*{{Citation|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=1|issue=3|pages=229\u201338|title=Psychology of the scientist: An analysis of problem-solving bias|first1=Michael J.|last1=Mahoney |first2=B.G.|last2=DeMonbreun |year=1977|doi=10.1007/BF01186796}}<br />*{{Citation|title=Norms and counter-norms in a select group of the Apollo moon scientists: A case study of the ambivalence of scientists|first=I.

Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative.

According to these ideas, each answer to a question yields a different amount of information, which depends on the person's prior beliefs. Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information. Since the information content depends on initial probabilities, a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative.

Suffering from undiagnosed [[dyslexia]], he experienced problems at school. He attended a private school, ''Clark's College'' in [[Ilford]], where he says they taught him less than the more basic council school. As well as dyslexia he also has the motor skill disorder dyspraxia ([[developmental coordination disorder]]).\n\nIn one school year, he claims he only attended 33 times.<ref name=Indy/> He left school on his fifteenth birthday, to become a copy boy at the [[Fleet Street]] offices of the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]''. He raced through a series of dead end jobs, before his call up for [[National Service]] in 1956, serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] in Singapore in 1957. The appropriation of his trumpet forced him to consider other creative outlets, and he bought a [[Rolleiflex]] camera.\n\nHe was [[Demobilization|demobbed]] in August 1958, and determined to pursue a career in photography, he bought a [[Canon (company)|Canon]] rangefinder camera.

The ''Box'' was an unusual and unique commercial release.  It reflected the changing status of the photographer that one could sell a collection of prints in this way. Strong objection to the presence of the Krays by fellow photographer, [[Lord Snowdon]], was the major reason no American edition of the \"Box\" was released, and that a second British edition was not issued.

The shoot included a baby wearing shocking eye makeup and, supposedly, one billion dollars in cash requiring the shoot to be under armed guard. In 1976, Bailey published ''[[Ritz Newspaper]]'' together with David Litchfield. In 1985, Bailey was photographing stars at the [[Live Aid]] concert at Wembley Stadium.

The record sale for a copy of 'Box of Pin-Ups' is reported as \"north of \u00a320,000\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Petkanas|first=Christopher|title=Photographer Who Broke Molds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/25iht-photog25.html|accessdate=24 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nBailey's ascent at ''Vogue'' was meteoric. Within months he was shooting covers and, at the height of his productivity, he shot 800 pages of ''Vogue'' editorial in one year.<ref name=\"Ellison\">{{cite news|last=Ellison|first=Jo|title=Rogue's Gallery|date=July 2010 |newspaper=British Vogue}}</ref> [[Penelope Tree]], a former girlfriend, described him as \"the king lion on the Savannah: incredibly attractive, with a dangerous vibe. He was the electricity, the brightest, most powerful, most talented, most energetic force at the magazine\".<ref name=\"Ellison\"/>\n\nAmerican ''Vogue''{{'}}s creative director [[Grace Coddington]], then a model herself, said \"It was the Sixties, it was a raving time, and Bailey was unbelievably good-looking. He was everything that you wanted him to be \u2013 like the Beatles but accessible \u2013 and when he went on the market everyone went in. We were all killing ourselves to be his model, although he hooked up with [[Jean Shrimpton]] pretty quickly\".<ref name=\"Ellison\"/>\n\nOf model [[Jean Shrimpton]], Bailey said: {{quote|She was magic and the camera loved her too. In a way she was the cheapest model in the world \u2013 you only needed to shoot half a roll of film and then you had it. She had the knack of having her hand in the right place, she knew where the light was, she was just a natural.<ref name=bbc/>}}\n\nSince 1966, Bailey has also directed several television commercials and [[television documentary|documentaries]]. From 1968 to 1971 he directed and produced TV documentaries titled ''Beaton, Warhol'' and ''Visconti''. As well as fashion photography, Bailey photographed album sleeve art for musicians including [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]]. One of Bailey's most famous works depicts the Rolling Stones including [[Brian Jones]], who drowned in 1969 while under the influence of drink and drugs. He is seen standing slightly apart from the rest of the group.<ref name=bbc/>\n\nBailey was hired in 1970 by [[Island Records]]' [[Chris Blackwell]] to shoot publicity photos of [[Cat Stevens]] for his upcoming album ''[[Tea for the Tillerman]]''. Stevens (now known as [[Yusuf Islam]]) maintains that he disliked having his photo on the cover of his albums, as had previously been the case, although he allowed Bailey's photographs to be placed on the inner sleeve of the album.<ref name=\"Cat Stevens pin-ups\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn53iV88SNo|title=A conversation with Yusuf Islam & Alun Davies|last=Islam|first=Yusuf|author2=Alun Davies|work=Interview (upon the anniversary of Island Records) of Stevens and Davies|publisher=YouTube|date=1970|accessdate=26 July 2015|location=UK}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, rock musician [[Alice Cooper]] was photographed by Bailey for ''Vogue'' magazine, almost naked apart from a snake. Cooper used Bailey the following year to shoot for the group's chart topping 'Billion Dollar Babies' album. The shoot included a baby wearing shocking eye makeup and, supposedly, one billion dollars in cash requiring the shoot to be under armed guard. In 1976, Bailey published ''[[Ritz Newspaper]]'' together with David Litchfield. In 1985, Bailey was photographing stars at the [[Live Aid]] concert at Wembley Stadium. As he recalled later: \"The atmosphere on the day was great. At one point I got a tap on my shoulder and spun round. Suddenly there was a big tongue down my throat! It was [[Freddie Mercury]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/oct/17/popandrock5|title=Live aid in their own words|work=The Observer|location=London|first=Carl|last=Wilkinson|date=17 October 2004|accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Bailey directed the BBC drama ''Who Dealt?'' starring [[Juliet Stevenson]], story by Ring Lardner.

In 1999, the management of Burswood undertook an extensive refurbishment program of the hotel rooms.\n\nIn 1996, pop superstar [[Michael Jackson]] performed three sold-out shows at Burswood Dome, on 30 November, 2 and 4 December, as part of his [[HIStory World Tour]] in front of 60,000 attendees.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nIn 2000, a $96 million resort renovation and improvement program was undertaken. 2001 and 2002 saw the opening of the Ruby Room nightclub and Champion's Bar, both within the casino, and also the opening of the Grand Ballroom. In 2003, Burswood entered into a deal with land developer Mirvac Fini for the residential development of vacant land between the complex and the [[Graham Farmer Freeway]]. Picking up from the long-neglected Stage 2 of the Burswood development plan, in the early 2000s the management of Burswood made various plans to build a second hotel on the site. Eventually, in 2003 they entered into a joint venture deal with the [[InterContinental Hotels Group]] to run the existing Burswood Resort Hotel (to be re-branded as Burswood InterContinental Hotel) and a new, 291-room Holiday Inn hotel to be constructed adjacent to the Burswood Theatre.<ref name=\"BurswoodDealBroadenAppeal\">{{cite news |first = Catie |last = Low |title = Burswood deal to broaden appeal. |work = [[The West Australian]] |publisher = West Australian Newspapers Ltd |date= 11 June 2003  }}</ref> In 2004, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]], whose principal shareholder was [[Kerry Packer]], acquired full control of the Burswood International Resort Casino, and in 2005 re-branded the site as \"Burswood Entertainment Complex\".

This new facility, called The Pearl Room, opened in late 2006 featuring 180 degree Swan River views. It replaced the old International Room which closed its doors following the unveiling of The Pearl Room. In 2007 [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] vested its gaming interests, which included Burswood, into [[Crown Limited]], a company controlled by [[James Packer]], the son and heir of [[Kerry Packer]], who died in December 2005. Also in 2007 Burswood opened The Meridian Room - a new gaming room featuring higher stakes open to the general public. The Meridian Room is located at the site of the old International Room, and has been refurbished to feature a contemporary design. MINQ, an exclusive late night bar, accessible only by a hosted lift at the entrance of The Meridian Room, opened in August 2007. Carbon Sports Bar opened in December 2007 and features a giant 12.5 x 4m wide screen and 16 x 52-inch plasmas. In December 2008, Burswood opened its new world-class dedicated poker room featuring plasma screens, dedicated bar and lounge area. In November 2009, [[Britney Spears]] performed 2 shows at the arena for her highly anticipated [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] tour. The shows at Burswood were Spears' first concerts in Australia. She was originally supposed to perform 5 shows in Australia during her 2004 [[The Onyx Hotel Tour|Onyx Hotel Tour]] (including one at the Burswood Dome), but the shows were canceled after Spears injured her knee while filming her video \"Outrageous\".

[[Progressive jackpot|Jackpots]] are linked to many of these games. Reel-slots, operated with a pull-down lever, are not permitted in Western Australia.\n\nThe table games include [[Baccarat]], Mini Baccarat, [[Blackjack]], [[Roulette]], [[Poker]] (Texas Hold'Em, Omaha), [[Three Card Poker]], [[Casino War]], Progressive Texas Hold'Em, [[Pai Gow]], [[Big Six wheel#Money wheel|Money Wheel]], [[Sic Bo]] and [[Caribbean Stud]].\n\nOn 1 August 2012, [[Crown Limited]] announced it was seeking a \"massive\" expansion of gambling facilities, increasing the number of poker machines to 2,500 and gaming tables will increase from the present number of 220 to 350, an increase of nearly 60%. The [[Government of Western Australia]] is backing Crown's application to the state's Gaming and Wagering Commission, and the proposal has the personal support of WA premier [[Colin Barnett]], who described the increase in gambling facilities \"as natural growth,\" and said it was \"common sense\" for the expansion as it was being made in line with the development of a new six-star hotel in the casino complex.<ref>http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/news/14432567/barnett-defends-huge-rise-in-gambling-tables/ [[The West Australian]]</ref>\n\nCrown has entered into an agreement with the state government to build the hotel on land the government will provide for $60 million. The government's agreement not to object to the increase in gambling facilities is part of the deal.

In 1999, the management of Burswood undertook an extensive refurbishment program of the hotel rooms.\n\nIn 1996, pop superstar [[Michael Jackson]] performed three sold-out shows at Burswood Dome, on 30 November, 2 and 4 December, as part of his [[HIStory World Tour]] in front of 60,000 attendees.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nIn 2000, a $96 million resort renovation and improvement program was undertaken. 2001 and 2002 saw the opening of the Ruby Room nightclub and Champion's Bar, both within the casino, and also the opening of the Grand Ballroom. In 2003, Burswood entered into a deal with land developer Mirvac Fini for the residential development of vacant land between the complex and the [[Graham Farmer Freeway]]. Picking up from the long-neglected Stage 2 of the Burswood development plan, in the early 2000s the management of Burswood made various plans to build a second hotel on the site. Eventually, in 2003 they entered into a joint venture deal with the [[InterContinental Hotels Group]] to run the existing Burswood Resort Hotel (to be re-branded as Burswood InterContinental Hotel) and a new, 291-room Holiday Inn hotel to be constructed adjacent to the Burswood Theatre.<ref name=\"BurswoodDealBroadenAppeal\">{{cite news |first = Catie |last = Low |title = Burswood deal to broaden appeal. |work = [[The West Australian]] |publisher = West Australian Newspapers Ltd |date= 11 June 2003  }}</ref> In 2004, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]], whose principal shareholder was [[Kerry Packer]], acquired full control of the Burswood International Resort Casino, and in 2005 re-branded the site as \"Burswood Entertainment Complex\".

This new facility, called The Pearl Room, opened in late 2006 featuring 180 degree Swan River views. It replaced the old International Room which closed its doors following the unveiling of The Pearl Room. In 2007 [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] vested its gaming interests, which included Burswood, into [[Crown Limited]], a company controlled by [[James Packer]], the son and heir of [[Kerry Packer]], who died in December 2005. Also in 2007 Burswood opened The Meridian Room - a new gaming room featuring higher stakes open to the general public. The Meridian Room is located at the site of the old International Room, and has been refurbished to feature a contemporary design. MINQ, an exclusive late night bar, accessible only by a hosted lift at the entrance of The Meridian Room, opened in August 2007. Carbon Sports Bar opened in December 2007 and features a giant 12.5 x 4m wide screen and 16 x 52-inch plasmas. In December 2008, Burswood opened its new world-class dedicated poker room featuring plasma screens, dedicated bar and lounge area. In November 2009, [[Britney Spears]] performed 2 shows at the arena for her highly anticipated [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] tour. The shows at Burswood were Spears' first concerts in Australia. She was originally supposed to perform 5 shows in Australia during her 2004 [[The Onyx Hotel Tour|Onyx Hotel Tour]] (including one at the Burswood Dome), but the shows were canceled after Spears injured her knee while filming her video \"Outrageous\".

[[Progressive jackpot|Jackpots]] are linked to many of these games. Reel-slots, operated with a pull-down lever, are not permitted in Western Australia.\n\nThe table games include [[Baccarat]], Mini Baccarat, [[Blackjack]], [[Roulette]], [[Poker]] (Texas Hold'Em, Omaha), [[Three Card Poker]], [[Casino War]], Progressive Texas Hold'Em, [[Pai Gow]], [[Big Six wheel#Money wheel|Money Wheel]], [[Sic Bo]] and [[Caribbean Stud]].\n\nOn 1 August 2012, [[Crown Limited]] announced it was seeking a \"massive\" expansion of gambling facilities, increasing the number of poker machines to 2,500 and gaming tables will increase from the present number of 220 to 350, an increase of nearly 60%. The [[Government of Western Australia]] is backing Crown's application to the state's Gaming and Wagering Commission, and the proposal has the personal support of WA premier [[Colin Barnett]], who described the increase in gambling facilities \"as natural growth,\" and said it was \"common sense\" for the expansion as it was being made in line with the development of a new six-star hotel in the casino complex.<ref>http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/news/14432567/barnett-defends-huge-rise-in-gambling-tables/ [[The West Australian]]</ref>\n\nCrown has entered into an agreement with the state government to build the hotel on land the government will provide for $60 million. The government's agreement not to object to the increase in gambling facilities is part of the deal.

His father's dependence on Raghu doesn't sit well with Vishnu (Anna's son), whose complexes arise from more than just his short stature, as he is only three feet tall. When Raghu falls for Zoya, a mute musically-inclined [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] girl who teaches children music, Vishnu jumps at the opportunity to use it to discredit his father's most favorite goon. \n\nVishnu kidnaps Gaitonde (one of his father's enemies) and tells a kid Zoya had selected for her music festival to shoot him. Zoya sees this and flees but Vishnu is already alerted of her presence. Vishnu tells his father that there was an eyewitness to Gaitonde's murder and that witness is Zoya, so Anna orders Raghu to kill Zoya, not knowing that Raghu loves her. Raghu finds Zoya and tries to run away from Vishnu and his father but Vishnu catches them and orders Raghu, Zoya, and all the kids to be killed. Vishnu's father tells Raghu he and the kids will be safe if he kills only Zoya, as she is the eyewitness to Gaitonde's murder. Zoya tells Raghu to kill her so that he and the kids remain safe. Zoya gives Raghu the gun, places her thumb over his, pulls the tigger and dies in his arms. \n\nThe police arrest a traumatized Raghu for Zoya's murder. In jail, Raghu becomes depressed and broken. Zoya is buried by the children, Raghu's friends and her friends. Vishnu tries to get Raghu killed in jail, knowing if he is released, he will take revenge. However, Raghu beats up the goons Vishnu hired. Vishnu then cuts off Raghu's friend Mazar's leg because Mazar kicked him. When Vishnu's father tells him that Raghu will be sentenced to life, Vishnu helps Raghu get out by [[witness tampering|bribing the proofs]], planning to kill Raghu upon his release.  However, when Raghu returns, Vishnu sees that Raghu is not the same after Zoya's death. His father tells him that Raghu died the day he killed Zoya. Vishnu tries various ways to bring Raghu back to his old ways but fails.Raghu had completely changed and all his old habits had changed. Vishnu's father catches him and warns him against this but Vishnu angrily kills his father and sends goons to kill Raghu. However, Raghu kills them all and buries them. He visits Zoya's grave and vows revenge on Vishnu; he is joined by his friends in this mission.\n\nOn the day of Dussera, when Vishnu comes to burn Ravana's idol, Raghu arrives and starts beating all the goons. Vishnu pierces an arrow into Raghu's heart but Raghu burns him. While dying, Raghu sees Zoya's soul and dies peacefully, surrounded by friends and family.

His father's dependence on Raghu doesn't sit well with Vishnu (Anna's son), whose complexes arise from more than just his short stature, as he is only three feet tall. When Raghu falls for Zoya, a mute musically-inclined [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] girl who teaches children music, Vishnu jumps at the opportunity to use it to discredit his father's most favorite goon. \n\nVishnu kidnaps Gaitonde (one of his father's enemies) and tells a kid Zoya had selected for her music festival to shoot him. Zoya sees this and flees but Vishnu is already alerted of her presence. Vishnu tells his father that there was an eyewitness to Gaitonde's murder and that witness is Zoya, so Anna orders Raghu to kill Zoya, not knowing that Raghu loves her. Raghu finds Zoya and tries to run away from Vishnu and his father but Vishnu catches them and orders Raghu, Zoya, and all the kids to be killed. Vishnu's father tells Raghu he and the kids will be safe if he kills only Zoya, as she is the eyewitness to Gaitonde's murder. Zoya tells Raghu to kill her so that he and the kids remain safe. Zoya gives Raghu the gun, places her thumb over his, pulls the tigger and dies in his arms. \n\nThe police arrest a traumatized Raghu for Zoya's murder. In jail, Raghu becomes depressed and broken. Zoya is buried by the children, Raghu's friends and her friends. Vishnu tries to get Raghu killed in jail, knowing if he is released, he will take revenge. However, Raghu beats up the goons Vishnu hired. Vishnu then cuts off Raghu's friend Mazar's leg because Mazar kicked him. When Vishnu's father tells him that Raghu will be sentenced to life, Vishnu helps Raghu get out by [[witness tampering|bribing the proofs]], planning to kill Raghu upon his release.  However, when Raghu returns, Vishnu sees that Raghu is not the same after Zoya's death. His father tells him that Raghu died the day he killed Zoya. Vishnu tries various ways to bring Raghu back to his old ways but fails.Raghu had completely changed and all his old habits had changed. Vishnu's father catches him and warns him against this but Vishnu angrily kills his father and sends goons to kill Raghu. However, Raghu kills them all and buries them. He visits Zoya's grave and vows revenge on Vishnu; he is joined by his friends in this mission.\n\nOn the day of Dussera, when Vishnu comes to burn Ravana's idol, Raghu arrives and starts beating all the goons. Vishnu pierces an arrow into Raghu's heart but Raghu burns him. While dying, Raghu sees Zoya's soul and dies peacefully, surrounded by friends and family. The police arrive and the inspector tells the [[Assistant Commissioner of Police#India|ACP]] that Raghu died. The ACP replies that Raghu returned to his life, which was with Zoya.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--Do not change cast order.
