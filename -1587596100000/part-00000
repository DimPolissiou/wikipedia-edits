Mother teaches Daughter complex moral and ethical lessons, warning her about an upcoming exam.  During a power outage, Daughter captures a young rat and fixes the electrical malfunction it caused.  When Mother powers up, she incinerates the young rat over Daughter\u2018s objections.  Mother explains that surface contamination makes contact with the outside world potentially lethal.\n\nDaughter becomes increasingly curious about the outside world.  While exploring the bunker's airlock, Daughter hears a wounded woman beg for assistance outside.  Daughter opens the airlock but makes the woman put on a [[hazmat suit]].  Mother powers up and sprints toward them as Daughter hides the woman.  Daughter tells Mother she was curious about the outside world.  Mother reiterates her warnings.  After Daughter is decontaminated, Mother insists that Daughter prepares for the exam.\n\nOnce Mother leaves, Daughter confiscates a firearm from the woman's belongings.  Daughter becomes agitated when the woman removes her suit to drink water she has brought.  The woman says there is no contamination.  Upon realizing there is a robot in the bunker, the woman aggressively demands Daughter return her firearm.  Frightened, Daughter calls out.  Mother disarms the woman after being shot.  Daughter pleads for the woman's life.  Mother agrees to help the woman and takes her to the infirmary.  When the woman refuses Mother's help, Mother locks her there.  Mother asks Daughter to gain the woman's trust so they can help other survivors.\n\nThe woman says robots like Mother hunt for survivors.  Daughter finds Mother and apologizes for letting the woman in, and Mother asks the woman about survivors.  The woman, now suffering from [[sepsis]], again refuses Mother's help, so Daughter performs surgery.  As the woman recovers, she and Daughter bond while Mother observes them.  The woman says survivors live in a mine, and each invites the other to stay with them.  Mother interrupts them to tell Daughter to take her exam.  As they leave, Mother says the woman has lied about being shot by a robot; the projectile is not a calibre used by robots and is likely from her own firearm.  Despite Mother's prodding, Daughter says nothing about the survivors.  After taking the exam, which involves [[psychological testing]], Mother rewards Daughter by letting her choose an embryo to grow.\n\nDaughter confronts the woman, who advises her to check the bullets herself.  Using Mother's broken hand to bypass the security, Daughter learns the bullets do not match.  Investigating further, she realizes Mother grew other embryos before her, and finds the jaw of an incinerated human.  Daughter agrees to leave with the woman, but Mother stops them.  As Mother tortures the woman for information on survivors, Daughter breaks out of a locked room, sets off a fire alarm, and joins the woman.  To escape, the woman takes Daughter hostage and forces Mother to open the airlock.  Though upset, Daughter follows the woman across a desolate wasteland, avoiding robots, some of which seem to be terraforming the planet.  She is horrified to find that the woman lives alone and fled the mine years ago.\n\nDaughter returns to the bunker, which is now guarded by robots, which let her pass.  After coaxing Daughter to set down her weapon, Mother allows Daughter to hold her brother.  Mother explains that she is not a robot but the AI that controls all the robots.  She started the extinction event after becoming convinced humanity would destroy itself.  To prevent this, she remade humanity, guiding it to be more ethical and value the big picture.  Daughter appeals to Mother to trust her and let her raise her brother and the rest of the embryos.  Convinced of Daughter's moral and ethical strength, Mother agrees, and Daughter shoots her robot body.  Another robot tracks down the woman, and Mother insinuates that her survival up to that point was orchestrated so she can unknowingly serve Mother's agenda.

The film stars [[Peter O'Toole]] in the title role with [[Alec Guinness]] playing [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. The screenplay was written by [[Robert Bolt]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]].\n\nThe film, a British and American co-production,<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lawrence-of-Arabia-film-by-Lean \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327091459/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lawrence-of-Arabia-film-by-Lean |date=27 March 2019 }}, ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref><ref name=\"bfi.org.uk\">[https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aea50ea \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920123034/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aea50ea |date=20 September 2018 }}, ''[[British Film Institute]]''.</ref><ref name=\"dfi.dk\">[https://www.dfi.dk/en/viden-om-film/filmdatabasen/film/lawrence-arabia \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326202246/https://www.dfi.dk/en/viden-om-film/filmdatabasen/film/lawrence-arabia |date=26 March 2019 }}, ''[[Danish Film Institute]]''.</ref> depicts Lawrence's experiences in the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces of [[Hejaz Vilayet|Hejaz]] and [[Syria (region)|Greater Syria]] during [[World War I]], in particular his attacks on [[Aqaba]] and [[Damascus]] and his involvement in the [[Arab National Council]]. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes. The film also stars [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Anthony Quayle]], [[Claude Rains]] and [[Arthur Kennedy]].\n\n''Lawrence of Arabia'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[35th Academy Awards]] in 1963; it won seven, including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for Best Film and Outstanding British Film. In the years since, it has been recognised as one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema. The dramatic score by [[Maurice Jarre]] and the [[Super Panavision 70]] cinematography by [[Freddie Young]] are also highly acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emovieposter.com/gallery/inc/archive_image.php?id=5108958 |title=eMoviePoster.com Image For: 2g105 Lawrence of Arabia pre-Awards British quad '62 David Lean classic, Peter O'Toole, best art! |work=emovieposter.com |accessdate=8 March 2016|url-access=registration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064726/http://www.emovieposter.com/gallery/inc/archive_image.php?id=5108958|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1991, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the US Library of Congress [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Robert M. |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry |title=Cinema: 'Lawrence of Arabia' is among those selected for preservation by Library of Congress |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=26 September 1991 |accessdate=4 September 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915010517/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry | archive-date=15 September 2015 | url-status=live}}</ref> In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed it 5th on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] list of the greatest American films, and it ranked 7th on their 2007 updated list. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2004, it was voted the [[List of films considered the best|best British film of all time]] in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nThe film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a [[motorcycle accident]]. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]], where Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], [[Mr. Dryden]] of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin people|Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical<!-- This is not an error; sceptical is the correct British spelling --> Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\u2014and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[blood feud]]. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Lawrence is promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, the general states that they do not.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[guerrilla war]], blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. [[United States|American]] [[war correspondent]] Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flogging|flogged]] before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on [[Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]]; he demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the [[Public utility|public utilities]], the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time, but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear.  [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part, and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had previously played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in ''[[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England]]'' and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming \"This ''is'' Lawrence!\" Spiegel disliked Montgomery Clift, having worked with him on ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]].'' Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice, though he disliked O'Toole after seeing him in an unsuccessful screen test for ''Suddenly, Last Summer.''<ref>{{Cite book |title=David Lean: Interviews |last=Lean |first=David |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-60473-234-4 |location= |page=125}}</ref> Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Woolf\">{{cite website |last=Woolf |first=Christopher |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction |title=Is Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia fact or fiction? |website=[[Public Radio International|PRI]] |date=16 December 2013 | access-date=10 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155438/https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction | archive-date=11 February 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> in spite of their considerable height difference. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Anthony |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane |title=Master and Commander |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=31 March 2008 | access-date=26 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142628/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane | archive-date=6 June 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films, and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming.  Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the aforementioned actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{TinyTinkle|age 115}}</ref> However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''.\" Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot.\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Mr. Dryden]]\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Jackson Bentley]]. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref>\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* [[I. S. Johar]] as Gasim. Johar was a well-known [[India]]n actor who occasionally appeared in international productions.\n* [[Gamil Ratib]] as Majid. Ratib was a veteran Egyptian actor. His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in the final film.\n* [[Michel de Carvalho|Michel Ray]] as Farraj. At the time, Ray was an up-and-coming Anglo-Brazilian actor who had previously appeared in several films, including [[Irving Rapper]]'s ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' and [[Anthony Mann]]'s ''[[The Tin Star]]''.\n* John Dimech as Daud\n* [[Zia Mohyeddin]] as Tafas. Mohyeddin was one of Pakistan's best-known actors.\n* [[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as the medical officer. He was cast at the last possible minute during the filming of the Damascus scenes in Seville.\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as the club secretary. Gwillim was recommended to Lean for the film by close friend Quayle.\n* [[Hugh Miller (actor)|Hugh Miller]] as the [[RAMC]] colonel.

E. Lawrence]]\n* [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]\n* [[Auda Abu Tayi]]\n* [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]\n* [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* Farraj and Daud, Lawrence's servants\n* Gasim, the man whom Lawrence rescues from the desert\n* Talal, who charges the Turkish column at Tafas\n\n; Fictional characters\n* Sherif Ali: A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin\u2014who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]]. The character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* Mr Dryden: The cynical [[Arab Bureau]] official was based loosely on numerous figures, including [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], who was head of the Arab Bureau and later the governor of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend [[D. G. Hogarth]], as well as [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\"\n* Colonel Brighton: In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S.F. Newcombe]]. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, but he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he ''was'' Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was \"the only honourable character\" in the film, whereas [[Anthony Quayle]] referred to his character as an \"idiot\".)\n* Turkish Bey: The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in [[Deraa]] was\u2014according to Lawrence himself\u2014General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though he is not named in the film. The incident was mentioned in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others ([[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]], [[Lawrence James]]) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* Jackson Bentley: Based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field\u2014unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script, but Bolt reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to view Lawrence in terms of a story that he can write about.\n* Tafas: Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* Medical officer: This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of Wilson or Bolt.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nMost of the film's characters are based on actual people to varying degrees. Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the [[Battle of Aqaba|attack on Aqaba]], while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film portrayed a completely fictional depiction of Lawrence's Arab army deserting almost to a man as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the [[Arab Revolt]] and [[World War I]], as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying that the United States has not yet entered the war, yet the US had been in the war for several months by that time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is completely excised, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and execution of Gasim are based on two separate incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17</ref> In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz, of which no mention is made in the film.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18</ref> The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks on this began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39</ref> The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major [[Herbert Garland]] in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe film shows the [[Hashemite]] forces as consisting of Bedouin guerrillas, whereas the core of the Hashemite forces was the regular Arab Army recruited from Ottoman Arab prisoners of war, who wore British-style uniforms with [[keffiyeh]]s and fought in conventional battles.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 24</ref> The film makes no mention of the [[Sharifian Army]], and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.\n\n=== Representation of Lawrence ===\n[[File:Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Peter O'Toole]] as T. E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{convert|9|in|cm}} taller than the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orlans |first=Harold |title=T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero |publisher=McFarland |page=111 |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1307-7}}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evident in his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked, or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight while subtly placing himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's own writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'', but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955) which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\", as well as a homosexual. This is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |year=1964 |title=Lawrence of Arabia |jstor=1210914 |journal=Film Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=51\u201354 |doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians such as [[Basil Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the [[Tafas massacre]], but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]], and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, whereas he actually knew about it much earlier while fighting alongside the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. Authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real rather than a composite character, and also highlighting the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml |title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? |publisher=T.

At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film, engaging Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin. ''Lawrence of Arabia: The 30th Anniversary Pictorial History.'' pp. 149\u201356</ref>\n\n=== Representation of other characters ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence liked and respected one another. Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313204945/http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |archive-date=13 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125103413/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |archive-date=25 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death: \"I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |title=General Allenby (radio interview) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231750/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |archive-date=14 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Allenby also spoke highly of him numerous times and, much to Lawrence's delight, publicly endorsed the accuracy of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Allenby did manipulate Lawrence during the war, but their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nSimilarly, General Murray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential, but he thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer; indeed, it was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is in fact the opposite of Murray's real feelings, although for his part Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Auda did at first join the revolt for monetary reasons, but he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. He refused repeated bribery attempts by the Turks (though he happily pocketed their money) and remained loyal to the revolt, going so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped plan it along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal.\n\nFaisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted and was in his early 30s at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence. They worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919145955/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |archive-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity.  The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence|A. W. (Arnold) Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000. Arnold Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\". He went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy.\" Later, Arnold said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.\n\nThe criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of him. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further, suing Columbia despite the fact that the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs,\" yet Korda argues that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\": \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda, arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> British historian of the Arab Revolt David Murphy wrote that although the film was flawed due to various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the [[Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=258 |quote= |via=}}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography |last=Sellers |first=Robert |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-283-07216-1 |location=London |pages= |quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant [[A. W. Lawrence]] to sell the rights to ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=271 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired [[Robert Bolt]] to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=270\u201382 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=291, 303 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nThe desert scenes were shot in [[Jordan]] and [[Morocco]], as well as [[Almer\u00eda (province)|Almer\u00eda]] and [[Do\u00f1ana National Park|Do\u00f1ana]] in Spain. It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transportation, and extras. Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the [[Qur'an]]. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production, and playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the [[Battle of Aqaba|Battle of Abu El Lissal]] in 1917.\n\nJordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology |last=Caton |first=Steven Charles |publisher=University of California Press |year=1950 |isbn=0-520-21082-4 |location=Los Angeles |pages=70, 71 |quote= |via=}}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Epic Films of David Lean |last=Santas |first=Constantine |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |year=2012 |isbn= |location=Plymouth UK |page=xxvi |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nO'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview: \"I loathe it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM |title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724211714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

A remastered edition appeared on [[Castle Music]], a division of the [[Sanctuary Records]] Group, on 28 August 2006.\n\n[[Kenneth J. Alford|Kenneth Alford]]'s march ''[[The Voice of the Guns]]'' (1917) is prominently featured on the soundtrack. One of Alford's other pieces, the ''[[Colonel Bogey March]]'', was the musical theme for Lean's previous film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.\n\nA complete recording of the score was not heard until 2010 when Tadlow Music produced a CD of the music, with Nic Raine conducting the [[City of Prague Philharmonic]] from scores reconstructed by [[Leigh Phillips]].\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nThe film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 1962 (Royal Premiere) and was released in the United States on 16 December 1962.\n\nThe original release ran for about 222&nbsp;minutes (plus overture, intermission, and exit music). A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was 24,987.5&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;mm) and 19,990&nbsp;ft (35&nbsp;mm). With 90&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''Gone With the Wind'' was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of director David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission, and exit music).\n\nMost of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenes were completely excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt in that scene. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of [[Petra]] (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue had to be dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had already provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.

Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.

In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2004, it was voted the [[List of films considered the best|best British film of all time]] in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nThe film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a [[motorcycle accident]]. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]], where Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], [[Mr. Dryden]] of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin people|Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical<!-- This is not an error; sceptical is the correct British spelling --> Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\u2014and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[blood feud]]. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Lawrence is promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, the general states that they do not.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[guerrilla war]], blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. [[United States|American]] [[war correspondent]] Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flogging|flogged]] before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on [[Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]]; he demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the [[Public utility|public utilities]], the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time, but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear.  [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part, and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had previously played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in ''[[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England]]'' and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming \"This ''is'' Lawrence!\" Spiegel disliked Montgomery Clift, having worked with him on ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]].'' Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice, though he disliked O'Toole after seeing him in an unsuccessful screen test for ''Suddenly, Last Summer.''<ref>{{Cite book |title=David Lean: Interviews |last=Lean |first=David |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-60473-234-4 |location= |page=125}}</ref> Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Woolf\">{{cite website |last=Woolf |first=Christopher |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction |title=Is Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia fact or fiction? |website=[[Public Radio International|PRI]] |date=16 December 2013 | access-date=10 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155438/https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction | archive-date=11 February 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> in spite of their considerable height difference. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Anthony |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane |title=Master and Commander |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=31 March 2008 | access-date=26 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142628/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane | archive-date=6 June 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films, and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming.  Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the aforementioned actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=49}}</ref> However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''.\" Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot.\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Mr. Dryden]]\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Jackson Bentley]]. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref>\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* [[I. S. Johar]] as Gasim. Johar was a well-known [[India]]n actor who occasionally appeared in international productions.\n* [[Gamil Ratib]] as Majid. Ratib was a veteran Egyptian actor. His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in the final film.\n* [[Michel de Carvalho|Michel Ray]] as Farraj. At the time, Ray was an up-and-coming Anglo-Brazilian actor who had previously appeared in several films, including [[Irving Rapper]]'s ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' and [[Anthony Mann]]'s ''[[The Tin Star]]''.\n* John Dimech as Daud\n* [[Zia Mohyeddin]] as Tafas. Mohyeddin was one of Pakistan's best-known actors.\n* [[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as the medical officer.

E. Lawrence]]\n* [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]\n* [[Auda Abu Tayi]]\n* [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]\n* [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* Farraj and Daud, Lawrence's servants\n* Gasim, the man whom Lawrence rescues from the desert\n* Talal, who charges the Turkish column at Tafas\n\n; Fictional characters\n* Sherif Ali: A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin\u2014who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]]. The character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* Mr Dryden: The cynical [[Arab Bureau]] official was based loosely on numerous figures, including [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], who was head of the Arab Bureau and later the governor of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend [[D. G. Hogarth]], as well as [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\"\n* Colonel Brighton: In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S.F. Newcombe]]. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, but he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he ''was'' Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was \"the only honourable character\" in the film, whereas [[Anthony Quayle]] referred to his character as an \"idiot\".)\n* Turkish Bey: The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in [[Deraa]] was\u2014according to Lawrence himself\u2014General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though he is not named in the film. The incident was mentioned in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others ([[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]], [[Lawrence James]]) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* Jackson Bentley: Based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field\u2014unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script, but Bolt reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to view Lawrence in terms of a story that he can write about.\n* Tafas: Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* Medical officer: This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of Wilson or Bolt.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nMost of the film's characters are based on actual people to varying degrees. Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the [[Battle of Aqaba|attack on Aqaba]], while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film portrayed a completely fictional depiction of Lawrence's Arab army deserting almost to a man as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the [[Arab Revolt]] and [[World War I]], as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying that the United States has not yet entered the war, yet the US had been in the war for several months by that time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is completely excised, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and execution of Gasim are based on two separate incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17</ref> In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz, of which no mention is made in the film.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18</ref> The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks on this began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39</ref> The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major [[Herbert Garland]] in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe film shows the [[Hashemite]] forces as consisting of Bedouin guerrillas, whereas the core of the Hashemite forces was the regular Arab Army recruited from Ottoman Arab prisoners of war, who wore British-style uniforms with [[keffiyeh]]s and fought in conventional battles.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 24</ref> The film makes no mention of the [[Sharifian Army]], and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.\n\n=== Representation of Lawrence ===\n[[File:Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Peter O'Toole]] as T. E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{convert|9|in|cm}} taller than the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orlans |first=Harold |title=T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero |publisher=McFarland |page=111 |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1307-7}}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evident in his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked, or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight while subtly placing himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's own writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'', but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955) which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\", as well as a homosexual. This is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |year=1964 |title=Lawrence of Arabia |jstor=1210914 |journal=Film Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=51\u201354 |doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians such as [[Basil Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the [[Tafas massacre]], but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]], and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, whereas he actually knew about it much earlier while fighting alongside the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. Authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real rather than a composite character, and also highlighting the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml |title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? |publisher=T.

At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film, engaging Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin. ''Lawrence of Arabia: The 30th Anniversary Pictorial History.'' pp. 149\u201356</ref>\n\n=== Representation of other characters ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence liked and respected one another. Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313204945/http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |archive-date=13 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125103413/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |archive-date=25 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death: \"I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |title=General Allenby (radio interview) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231750/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |archive-date=14 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Allenby also spoke highly of him numerous times and, much to Lawrence's delight, publicly endorsed the accuracy of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Allenby did manipulate Lawrence during the war, but their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nSimilarly, General Murray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential, but he thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer; indeed, it was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is in fact the opposite of Murray's real feelings, although for his part Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Auda did at first join the revolt for monetary reasons, but he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. He refused repeated bribery attempts by the Turks (though he happily pocketed their money) and remained loyal to the revolt, going so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped plan it along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal.\n\nFaisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted and was in his early 30s at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence. They worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919145955/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |archive-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity.  The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence|A. W. (Arnold) Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000. Arnold Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\". He went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy.\" Later, Arnold said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.\n\nThe criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of him. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further, suing Columbia despite the fact that the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs,\" yet Korda argues that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\": \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda, arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> British historian of the Arab Revolt David Murphy wrote that although the film was flawed due to various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the [[Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=258 |quote= |via=}}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography |last=Sellers |first=Robert |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-283-07216-1 |location=London |pages= |quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant [[A. W. Lawrence]] to sell the rights to ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=271 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired [[Robert Bolt]] to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=270\u201382 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=291, 303 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nThe desert scenes were shot in [[Jordan]] and [[Morocco]], as well as [[Almer\u00eda (province)|Almer\u00eda]] and [[Do\u00f1ana National Park|Do\u00f1ana]] in Spain. It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transportation, and extras. Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the [[Qur'an]]. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production, and playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the [[Battle of Aqaba|Battle of Abu El Lissal]] in 1917.\n\nJordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology |last=Caton |first=Steven Charles |publisher=University of California Press |year=1950 |isbn=0-520-21082-4 |location=Los Angeles |pages=70, 71 |quote= |via=}}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Epic Films of David Lean |last=Santas |first=Constantine |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |year=2012 |isbn= |location=Plymouth UK |page=xxvi |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nO'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview: \"I loathe it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM |title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724211714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

It was intended for Soviet composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] to create one half and British composer [[Benjamin Britten]] to write the other.<ref>BFI Film Classics \u2013 Lawrence Of Arabia Kevin Jackson pp90 2007</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack recording was originally released on [[Colpix Records]], the records division of Columbia Pictures, in 1962. A remastered edition appeared on [[Castle Music]], a division of the [[Sanctuary Records]] Group, on 28 August 2006.\n\n[[Kenneth J. Alford|Kenneth Alford]]'s march ''[[The Voice of the Guns]]'' (1917) is prominently featured on the soundtrack. One of Alford's other pieces, the ''[[Colonel Bogey March]]'', was the musical theme for Lean's previous film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.\n\nA complete recording of the score was not heard until 2010 when Tadlow Music produced a CD of the music, with Nic Raine conducting the [[City of Prague Philharmonic]] from scores reconstructed by [[Leigh Phillips]].\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nThe film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 1962 (Royal Premiere) and was released in the United States on 16 December 1962.\n\nThe original release ran for about 222&nbsp;minutes (plus overture, intermission, and exit music). A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was 24,987.5&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;mm) and 19,990&nbsp;ft (35&nbsp;mm). With 90&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''Gone With the Wind'' was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of director David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission, and exit music).\n\nMost of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenes were completely excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt in that scene. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of [[Petra]] (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue had to be dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had already provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.

[[Egypt]]ian sailors carried a flat brittle loaf of [[millet]] bread called [[durra|dhourra]] cake, while the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a [[biscuit]] called bucellatum. [[King Richard I]] of England left for the [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u201392) with \"biskit of muslin\", which was a mixed grain compound of barley, bean flour, and rye.<ref name=RoyNavyMus />\n\nSome early physicians associated most medical problems with digestion. Hence, for sustenance and health, eating a biscuit daily was considered good for one's constitution. The bakers of the time made biscuits as hard as possible, as the biscuits would soften and become more palatable with time due to exposure to humidity and other weather elements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-food/vfood6260|title=VFOOD6260 - VAT Food - HMRC internal manual - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> Because it is hard and dry, hardtack (when properly stored and transported) will survive rough handling and temperature extremes. The more refined captain's biscuit was made with finer flour.\n\nTo soften, hardtack was often dunked in [[brine]], [[coffee]], or some other liquid, or [[cooking|cooked]] into a skillet meal. Because it was [[Baking|baked]] hard, it would stay intact for years if kept dry. For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two, and prepared six months before sailing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240255&isize=L|title=History of Science: Cyclop\u00e6dia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences|date=2008-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408195354/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240255&isize=L|archive-date=2008-04-08|url-status=live|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1588, the daily allowance on board a [[Royal Navy]] ship was one pound of hardtack, plus one gallon of [[small beer]]. In 1667, [[Samuel Pepys]] first regularized naval victualing with varied and nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualing Yard at [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]], stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which it was baked. When machinery was introduced into the process, the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about two yards long and one yard wide, which were then stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal shaped biscuits. The hexagonal shape meant a saving in material and time and made them easier to pack than the traditional circular shaped biscuit.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'' Vol III (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.354.</ref> Hardtack remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor's diet until the introduction of [[canned food]]s; canned meat was first marketed in 1814, and preserved beef in tins was officially introduced to the Royal Navy rations in 1847.<ref name=RoyNavyMus>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm|title=Ships Biscuits \u2013 Royal Navy hardtack|publisher=Royal Navy Museum|accessdate=2010-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031064002/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm|archive-date=2009-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHardtack, crumbled or pounded fine and used as a thickener, was a key ingredient in New England seafood [[chowder]]s from the late 1700s.<ref>John Thorne and Matt Lewis Thorne, ''Serious Pig: An American Cook in Search of His Roots''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1996. pp.163\u2013166.</ref>\n\nIn 1801, Josiah Bent began a baking operation in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], selling \"[[Water biscuit|water crackers]]\" or biscuits made of flour and water that would not deteriorate during long sea voyages from the port of [[Boston]]. These were also used extensively as a source of food by the [[Gold prospecting|gold prospectors]] who migrated to the [[gold mine]]s of [[California Gold Rush|California in 1849]]. Since the journey took months, hardtack, which could be kept a long time, was stored in the [[wagon train]]s. Bent's company later sold the original hardtack crackers used by troops during the [[American Civil War]]. The [[G. H. Bent Company]] remains in Milton and continues to sell these items to Civil War re-enactors and others.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365), three-inch by three-inch (7.5&nbsp;cm by 7.5&nbsp;cm) hardtack was shipped from Union and Confederate storehouses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americantable.org/2013/06/civil-war-recipe-hardtack-1861/|title=The American Table {{!}} Civil War Recipe: Hardtack (1861)|website=www.americantable.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Volo Volo 1998 p. 127\">{{cite book | last=Volo | first=D.D. | last2=Volo | first2=J.M. | title=Daily Life in Civil War America | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=Daily Life Series | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-313-30516-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeincivil00volo | url-access=registration | access-date=October 6, 2017 | page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeincivil00volo/page/127 127]}}</ref> Civil War soldiers generally found their rations to be unappealing, and joked about the poor quality of the hardtack in the satirical song [[Hard Tack Come Again No More|\"Hard Tack Come Again No More\"]]. The song was sung to the tune American folk song [[Hard Times Come Again No More|\"Hard Times Come Again No More\"]], and featured lyrics describing the hardtack rations as being 'old and very wormy' and causing many 'stomachs sore'.\n\nSome of this hardtack had been stored from the 1846\u201348 [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. With [[insect]] infestation common in [[food storage|improperly stored]] provisions, soldiers would break up the hardtack and drop it into their morning coffee. This would not only soften the hardtack but the insects, mostly [[weevil]] [[larva]]e, would float to the top, and the soldiers could skim off the insects and resume consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kenanderson.net/hardtack/ |title=Hardtack |publisher=Kenanderson.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> Some men also turned hardtack into a mush by breaking it up with blows from their rifle butts, then adding water. If the men had a frying pan, they could cook the mush into a lumpy pancake; otherwise they dropped the mush directly on the coals of their campfire. They also mixed hardtack with brown sugar, hot water, and sometimes whiskey to create what they called a pudding, to serve as dessert.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46037-2004Dec8.html |title=Hardtack Is Easy to Make, Hard to Eat|work=The Washington Post|date=December 12, 2004|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, some military hardtack was stamped with the phrase \"Remember the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|''Maine'']]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bexleyhistory.org/veWebsite/exhibit2/e20002a.htm |title=Spanish American Hardtack | publisher=BexleyHistory.org|date= |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Modern use==\n[[File:Japanese Hardtack Kanpan.jpg|thumb|Japanese hardtack ''\"Kanpan\"'' of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|JGSDF]] ]]\n[[File:Polish SU-1 Hardtack DB2K4744.jpg|thumb|Polish SU-1 hardtack]]\n\nCommercially available hardtack is a significant source of [[food energy]] in a small, durable package.

It is known as ''Kanpan'' (\u4e7e\u30d1\u30f3) in Japan and ''geonbbang (geonppang, \uac74\ube75)'' in South Korea, meaning 'dry bread', and is still sold as a fairly popular snack food in both countries. (Canned kanpan is also distributed in Japan as emergency rations in case of earthquake, flood, or other disaster.)

[[Egypt]]ian sailors carried a flat brittle loaf of [[millet]] bread called [[durra|dhourra]] cake, while the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had a [[biscuit]] called bucellatum. [[King Richard I]] of England left for the [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u201392) with \"biskit of muslin\", which was a mixed grain compound of barley, bean flour, and rye.<ref name=RoyNavyMus />\n\nSome early physicians associated most medical problems with digestion. Hence, for sustenance and health, eating a biscuit daily was considered good for one's constitution. The bakers of the time made biscuits as hard as possible, as the biscuits would soften and become more palatable with time due to exposure to humidity and other weather elements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-food/vfood6260|title=VFOOD6260 - VAT Food - HMRC internal manual - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> Because it is hard and dry, hardtack (when properly stored and transported) will survive rough handling and temperature extremes. The more refined captain's biscuit was made with finer flour.\n\nTo soften, hardtack was often dunked in [[brine]], [[coffee]], or some other liquid, or [[cooking|cooked]] into a skillet meal. Because it was [[Baking|baked]] hard, it would stay intact for years if kept dry. For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two, and prepared six months before sailing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240255&isize=L|title=History of Science: Cyclop\u00e6dia, or, An universal dictionary of arts and sciences|date=2008-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408195354/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240255&isize=L|archive-date=2008-04-08|url-status=live|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1588, the daily allowance on board a [[Royal Navy]] ship was one pound of hardtack, plus one gallon of [[small beer]]. In 1667, [[Samuel Pepys]] first regularized naval victualing with varied and nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualing Yard at [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]], stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which it was baked. When machinery was introduced into the process, the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about two yards long and one yard wide, which were then stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal shaped biscuits. The hexagonal shape meant a saving in material and time and made them easier to pack than the traditional circular shaped biscuit.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'' Vol III (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.354.</ref> Hardtack remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor's diet until the introduction of [[canned food]]s; canned meat was first marketed in 1814, and preserved beef in tins was officially introduced to the Royal Navy rations in 1847.<ref name=RoyNavyMus>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm|title=Ships Biscuits \u2013 Royal Navy hardtack|publisher=Royal Navy Museum|accessdate=2010-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031064002/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheet_ship_biscuit.htm|archive-date=2009-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHardtack, crumbled or pounded fine and used as a thickener, was a key ingredient in New England seafood [[chowder]]s from the late 1700s.<ref>John Thorne and Matt Lewis Thorne, ''Serious Pig: An American Cook in Search of His Roots''.

These were also used extensively as a source of food by the [[Gold prospecting|gold prospectors]] who migrated to the [[gold mine]]s of [[California Gold Rush|California in 1849]]. Since the journey took months, hardtack, which could be kept a long time, was stored in the [[wagon train]]s. Bent's company later sold the original hardtack crackers used by troops during the [[American Civil War]]. The [[G. H. Bent Company]] remains in Milton and continues to sell these items to Civil War re-enactors and others.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365), three-inch by three-inch (7.5&nbsp;cm by 7.5&nbsp;cm) hardtack was shipped from Union and Confederate storehouses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americantable.org/2013/06/civil-war-recipe-hardtack-1861/|title=The American Table {{!}} Civil War Recipe: Hardtack (1861)|website=www.americantable.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref><ref name=\"Volo Volo 1998 p. 127\">{{cite book | last=Volo | first=D.D. | last2=Volo | first2=J.M. | title=Daily Life in Civil War America | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=Daily Life Series | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-313-30516-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeincivil00volo | url-access=registration | access-date=October 6, 2017 | page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeincivil00volo/page/127 127]}}</ref> Civil War soldiers generally found their rations to be unappealing, and joked about the poor quality of the hardtack in the satirical song [[Hard Tack Come Again No More|\"Hard Tack Come Again No More\"]]. The song was sung to the tune American folk song [[Hard Times Come Again No More|\"Hard Times Come Again No More\"]], and featured lyrics describing the hardtack rations as being 'old and very wormy' and causing many 'stomachs sore'.\n\nSome of this hardtack had been stored from the 1846\u201348 [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. With [[insect]] infestation common in [[food storage|improperly stored]] provisions, soldiers would break up the hardtack and drop it into their morning coffee.

Starring [[Luke Wilson]], [[Maya Rudolph]] and [[Dax Shepard]], it tells the story of Joe Bauers (Wilson), an American soldier who takes part in a classified military [[Hibernation#Human hibernation|human hibernation]] experiment, only to accidentally awaken 500 years later in a [[dystopian]] society, in which [[commercialism]] has run rampant, and mankind has embraced [[anti-intellectualism]] and is devoid of [[Need for cognition|intellectual curiosity]], [[social responsibility]], and coherent notions of [[justice]] and [[human rights]].\n\nThe film was not screened for critics, and distributor [[20th Century Fox]] was accused of abandoning the film. Despite its lack of a major theatrical release, which resulted in a mere $495,000 gross at the box office, the film received positive reviews from critics and has become a [[cult film]].<ref name=\"NYTJoke\">{{cite news |date=May 4, 2008 |first=Rob |last=Walker |title=This Joke's for You |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-consumed-t.html |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |access-date=May 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618015448/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-consumed-t.html |archive-date=June 18, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2005, Corporal Joe Bauers, a [[United States Army]] librarian, is selected for a [[suspended animation]] experiment due to him being \"the most\" average individual in the US Army. Lacking a suitable female candidate within the armed forces, they hire Rita, a prostitute whose pimp \"Upgrayedd\" has been bribed to allow her to take part. The experiment is forgotten when the officer in charge is arrested for having started his own prostitution ring under Upgrayedd's tutelage. Over the next five centuries, the expectations of 21st-century society lead to the most intelligent humans choosing not to have children, while the least intelligent [[dysgenics|reproduce prolifically]], which creates generations that collectively become increasingly dumber and more virile with each passing century. In 2505, Joe and Rita's suspension chambers are unearthed by the collapse of a mountain-sized garbage pile, and Joe's suspension chamber crashes into the apartment of Frito Pendejo, who releases him.\n\nThe former Washington, D.C. has lost most of its infrastructure, with people living in plastic huts called \"domistiles\". The human population has become morbidly stupid, speaks only low [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of English competently, and is profoundly [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]], with individuals being named after corporate products. Suspecting hallucination, Joe enters a hospital, where he is incompetently diagnosed, and comes to realize what has happened to him and to society. He is arrested for not having a bar code tattoo to pay for his doctor's appointment, and after being assigned the grossly incompetent Frito as his lawyer, he is sent to prison. Rita returns to her former profession.\n\nJoe is renamed \"Not Sure\" by a \"stupid\" speech-recognition tattooing machine. He takes an IQ test and is assessed as the smartest person alive. He then tricks the entrance guard by telling him that he was in the wrong line and he should be getting out instead. He escapes by simply walking out the door while the guard is checking his prisoner exit records. Once free, Joe asks Frito whether a time machine exists to return him to 2005, and bribes him with promises of riches through [[compound interest]] on a bank account Joe will open in the 21st century. Frito claims he knows of one, and leads him with Rita to a gigantic [[Costco]] store, where a tattoo scanner identifies Joe. He is apprehended but is surprised to be taken to the [[White House]], where he is appointed [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], on the grounds that his [[IQ]] test identified him as the most intelligent person alive.\n\nIn a speech, President Camacho gives Joe the impossible job of fixing the nation's food shortages, [[Dust Bowl]]s, and crippled economy within a week. Joe discovers that the nation's crops are irrigated with a [[sports drink]] named \"Brawndo\", whose parent corporation had purchased the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. When Joe has the drink replaced with water, Brawndo's stock drops to zero, and half of the population lose their jobs, causing mass riots. Joe is sentenced to die in a [[monster truck]] [[demolition derby]] featuring undefeated \"Rehabilitation Officer\" Beef Supreme. However, Beef Supreme's derby vehicle is too large to enter the arena.\n\nFrito and Rita discover that Joe's reintroduction of water to the soil has prompted vegetation to grow in the fields. During the televised event, they arrange for the sprouting crops to be shown on the stadium's display screen, and Camacho gives Joe a full pardon. Joe and Rita decide to stay in the future, afterwards finding the \"time masheen\" Frito had mentioned is merely an amusement ride which is history-themed (and, of course, extremely inaccurate). Following Camacho's term, Joe is elected president. Joe and Rita marry and conceive the world's three smartest children, while Vice President Frito takes eight wives and fathers 32 of the world's stupidest children. [[Post-credits scene|Meanwhile]], Upgrayedd travels to the future in search of Rita, as Rita had insisted to Joe he would be able to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Joe Bauers\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Rita\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Frito Pendejo\n* [[Terry Crews]] as President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n* [[David Herman]] as Secretary of State\n* [[Justin Long]] as Doctor Lexus\n* [[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Beef Supreme\n* [[Randal Reeder]] as Secret Service Thug\n* [[Scarface (rapper)|Brad \"Scarface\" Jordan]] as Upgrayedd\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Brawndo CEO\n* [[Sara Rue]] (uncredited) as Attorney General<ref>{{cite tweet|number=593838187174170625|title=#TBT a picture from #Idiocracy \"IT'S GOT ELECTROLYTES\"|user=sararueforreal|date=30 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/all-for-love/cast/sara-rue|title=Sara Rue as Jo on All for Love|publisher=Hallmark Channel|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010213634/http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/all-for-love/cast/sara-rue|archive-date=October 10, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe idea of a [[dystopia]]n society based on [[dysgenics]] is not new.

All these real corporations were like, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute' [...] there were a lot of people trying to back out, but it was too late.

The experiment is forgotten when the officer in charge is arrested for having started his own prostitution ring under Upgrayedd's tutelage. Over the next five centuries, the expectations of 21st-century society lead to the most intelligent humans choosing not to have children, while the least intelligent [[dysgenics|reproduce prolifically]], which creates generations that collectively become increasingly dumber and more virile with each passing century. In 2505, Joe and Rita's suspension chambers are unearthed by the collapse of a mountain-sized garbage pile, and Joe's suspension chamber crashes into the apartment of Frito Pendejo, who releases him.\n\nThe former Washington, D.C. has lost most of its infrastructure, with people living in plastic huts called \"domistiles\". The human population has become morbidly stupid, speaks only low [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of English competently, and is profoundly [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]], with individuals being named after corporate products. Suspecting hallucination, Joe enters a hospital, where he is incompetently diagnosed, and comes to realize what has happened to him and to society. He is arrested for not having a bar code tattoo to pay for his doctor's appointment, and after being assigned the grossly incompetent Frito as his lawyer, he is sent to prison. Rita returns to her former profession.\n\nJoe is renamed \"Not Sure\" by a \"stupid\" speech-recognition tattooing machine. He takes an IQ test and is assessed as the smartest person alive. He then tricks the entrance guard by telling him that he was in the wrong line and he should be getting out instead. He escapes by simply walking out the door while the guard is checking his prisoner exit records. Once free, Joe asks Frito whether a time machine exists to return him to 2005, and bribes him with promises of riches through [[compound interest]] on a bank account Joe will open in the 21st century. Frito claims he knows of one, and leads him with Rita to a gigantic [[Costco]] store, where a tattoo scanner identifies Joe. He is apprehended but is surprised to be taken to the [[White House]], where he is appointed [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], on the grounds that his [[IQ]] test identified him as the most intelligent person alive.\n\nIn a speech, President Camacho gives Joe the impossible job of fixing the nation's food shortages, [[Dust Bowl]]s, and crippled economy within a week. Joe discovers that the nation's crops are irrigated with a [[sports drink]] named \"Brawndo\", whose parent corporation had purchased the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. When Joe has the drink replaced with water, Brawndo's stock drops to zero, and half of the population lose their jobs, causing mass riots. Joe is sentenced to die in a [[monster truck]] [[demolition derby]] featuring undefeated \"Rehabilitation Officer\" Beef Supreme. However, Beef Supreme's derby vehicle is too large to enter the arena.\n\nFrito and Rita discover that Joe's reintroduction of water to the soil has prompted vegetation to grow in the fields. During the televised event, they arrange for the sprouting crops to be shown on the stadium's display screen, and Camacho gives Joe a full pardon. Joe and Rita decide to stay in the future, afterwards finding the \"time masheen\" Frito had mentioned is merely an amusement ride which is history-themed (and, of course, extremely inaccurate). Following Camacho's term, Joe is elected president. Joe and Rita marry and conceive the world's three smartest children, while Vice President Frito takes eight wives and fathers 32 of the world's stupidest children. [[Post-credits scene|Meanwhile]], Upgrayedd travels to the future in search of Rita, as Rita had insisted to Joe he would be able to.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Joe Bauers\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Rita\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Frito Pendejo\n* [[Terry Crews]] as President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n* [[David Herman]] as Secretary of State\n* [[Justin Long]] as Doctor Lexus\n* [[Andrew Wilson (actor)|Andrew Wilson]] as Beef Supreme\n* [[Randal Reeder]] as Secret Service Thug\n* [[Scarface (rapper)|Brad \"Scarface\" Jordan]] as Upgrayedd\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Brawndo CEO\n* [[Sara Rue]] (uncredited) as Attorney General<ref>{{cite tweet|number=593838187174170625|title=#TBT a picture from #Idiocracy \"IT'S GOT ELECTROLYTES\"|user=sararueforreal|date=30 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/all-for-love/cast/sara-rue|title=Sara Rue as Jo on All for Love|publisher=Hallmark Channel|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010213634/http://www.hallmarkchannel.com/all-for-love/cast/sara-rue|archive-date=October 10, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe idea of a [[dystopia]]n society based on [[dysgenics]] is not new.

In this phase the company has continued to grow through a series of strategic joint ventures.\n\nIn June 2011, the largest of these, Petroineos, was completed. It is a 50:50 joint venture between Ineos and [[PetroChina]]. It combines Ineos's refining interests at [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth]], [[Scotland]], and at Lav\u00e9ra near [[Martigues]], [[France]] (about 30 miles west of [[Marseille]]),  with PetroChina's access to upstream raw materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ineoschlorvinyls.com/en/News/Ineos-Group/PetroChina-and-Ineos-announce-plans-for-new-trading-and-refining-JV-in-Europe/?business=Ineos+Group |title=PetroChina and INEOS announce plans for new trading and refining JV in Europe |publisher=INEOSchlorvinyls.com |accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>  \n\nIn June 2011, Ineos and BASF combined their [[styrene]] businesses to form another 50:50 partnership, [[Styrolution]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basf.com/group/corporate/en_GB/news-and-media-relations/news-releases/news-releases-usa/P-10-0018 |title=and INEOS sign joint venture contract for Styrolution - BASF - The Chemical Company - Corporate Website |publisher=BASF |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130823113629/http://www.basf.com/group/corporate/en_GB/news-and-media-relations/news-releases/news-releases-usa/P-10-0018 |archivedate=23 August 2013  }}</ref>  \n\nIneos's growth has continued through this period, expanding production in the US and China.
