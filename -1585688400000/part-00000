Multiple train and subway lines, a large highway building project, and the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen|Tokaido Shinkansen]], the fastest train in the world, were completed.

Enormous energy and expense was devoted to upgrading the city's physical infrastructure, including new buildings, highways, stadiums, hotels, airports and trains.  There was a new satellite to facilitate live international broadcast.  Multiple train and subway lines, a large highway building project, and the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen|Tokaido Shinkansen]], the fastest train in the world, were completed. [[Haneda Airport|Haneda International Airport]] and the [[Port of Tokyo]] were modernized. International satellite broadcasting was initiated, and Japan was now connected to the world with a new undersea communications cable.<ref name=\"committee_v1p2_communications\"/> The [[YS-11]], a commercial turboprop plane developed in Japan, was used to transport the Olympic Flame within Japan.<ref name=\"committee_v1p1_torch\">{{Harvnb|Organizing Committee|1964|pp=245\u2013269}}</ref> For swimming, a new timing system started the clock by the sound of the starter gun and stopped it with touchpads.

This is partly due to the fact that not all Urbach-Wiethe patients exhibit calcifications, but also because similar lesions can be formed from other diseases such as [[herpes simplex]] and [[encephalitis]].

It also allows doctors to better distinguish between Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease and other similar diseases not caused by mutations in ECM1.\n\n== Treatment ==\nCurrently, there is no cure for Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease although there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms.

In some regions of South Africa, up to one in 12 individuals may be carriers of the disease.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>  Most of the case studies involving Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease patients involve only one to three cases and these cases are often in the same family.  Due to its low incidence, it is difficult to find a large enough number of cases to adequately study the disease.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1908, what appears to be the first case of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was reported by [[Friedrich Siebenmann]], a professor of [[otolaryngology]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].  In 1925, [[Friedrich Miescher]], a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients.<ref name=Caro-1978/> An official report of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Its original name of 'lipoidosis cutis et mucosae' was changed to 'lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae' due to Urbach's belief that the condition was due to abnormal [[lipid]] and [[protein]] deposits within the tissues.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of [[mucopolysaccharidosis]], [[amyloidosis]], or even [[porphyria]].  The discovery of the Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease from these other conditions.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\n== Society ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is used as the main plot element in a 2013 Dutch novel, ''De angstjager'' (The Fear Hunter) by author [[Joris van Os]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl/de-angstjager/|title=De Angstjager|first=Bravebox|last=www.bravebox.nl|date=|website=uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nReleased in 2015, ''A Fearless Life'' by author Joshua McCloskey is about a young woman's life living with Urbach-Wiethe.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Fearless Life|asin = B015ONZQ2Y|publisher = Joshua McCloskey|date = 2015-09-21|language = English|first = Joshua|last = McCloskey}}</ref>\n\nUrbach-Wiethe disease and the case study of SM-046 are the source of the main plot elements in two stories in ''Movemind'' by author Robert New. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertsnew.com/2018/06/25/whats-my-favourite-piece-of-my-writing/|title=What's my favourite piece of my writing?|author=|date=26 June 2018|website=robertsnew.com|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|title = Movemind|asin = B07BQ9K92J|publisher = Tale Publishing|date = 2018-06-01|language = English|first = Robert|last = New}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S.M.

''Pediatric Dermatology'' 22:266&ndash;7</ref>\n\n=== Dermatological ===\nAlthough [[symptom]]s can vary greatly between affected individuals, even those within the same family, symptoms normally begin in [[infancy]] and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes.<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/>  The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords.  The [[hoarse]] voice can be one of the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/> Lesions and scars also appear on the [[skin]], usually the [[face]] and the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] parts of the limbs.<ref name=Caro-1978/> This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance.  Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars.<ref name=Appenzeller-etal-2006-Neuroimaging16/> The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly.  White or yellow [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrates]] form on the lips, [[buccal mucosa]], [[tonsils]], [[uvula]], [[epiglottis]] and [[frenulum]] of the tongue.<ref name=Caro-1978/> This can lead to [[upper respiratory tract infection]] and sometimes requires [[tracheostomy]] to relieve the symptom.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/> Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in [[speech impediment]]s.<ref name=Thornton-etal-2008>Thornton HB, Nel D, Thornton D, van Honk J, Baker GA, Stein DJ. 2008.

About 50&ndash;75%  of the diagnosed cases of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease also show bilateral symmetrical [[calcification]]s on the medial [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref>Hurlemann R, Wagner M, Hawellek B, Reich H, Pieperhoff P, Amunts K, et al. 2007.

These calcifications are the result of a buildup of [[calcium]] deposits in the [[blood vessel]]s within this brain region.  Over time, these vessels [[Atherosclerosis|harden]] and the tissue they are a part of dies, causing lesions.  The amount of calcification is often related to disease duration.<ref name=Appenzeller-etal-2006-Neuroimaging16/> The true prevalence of these calcifications is difficult to accurately state as not all patients undergo [[neuroimaging|brain imaging]].  Some patients also exhibit [[epilepsy]] and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Epilepsy symptoms could begin with light anxiety attacks and can be controlled with anti-epileptic medications including Valproic Acid (Epilim). <ref name=Appenzeller-etal-2006-Neuroimaging16/>  Other patients present with symptoms similar to schizophrenia while some suffer from mood, [[anxiety]], and psychotic disorders.<ref name = Thornton-etal-2008/><ref name = Cinaz-1993>Cinaz P, Guvenir T, Gonlusen G. 1993.

Due to its low incidence, it is difficult to find a large enough number of cases to adequately study the disease.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1908, what appears to be the first case of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was reported by [[Friedrich Siebenmann]], a professor of [[otolaryngology]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].  In 1925, [[Friedrich Miescher]], a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients.<ref name=Caro-1978/> An official report of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Its original name of 'lipoidosis cutis et mucosae' was changed to 'lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae' due to Urbach's belief that the condition was due to abnormal [[lipid]] and [[protein]] deposits within the tissues.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of [[mucopolysaccharidosis]], [[amyloidosis]], or even [[porphyria]].  The discovery of the Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease from these other conditions.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\n== Society ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is used as the main plot element in a 2013 Dutch novel, ''De angstjager'' (The Fear Hunter) by author [[Joris van Os]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl/de-angstjager/|title=De Angstjager|first=Bravebox|last=www.bravebox.nl|date=|website=uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nReleased in 2015, ''A Fearless Life'' by author Joshua McCloskey is about a young woman's life living with Urbach-Wiethe.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Fearless Life|asin = B015ONZQ2Y|publisher = Joshua McCloskey|date = 2015-09-21|language = English|first = Joshua|last = McCloskey}}</ref>\n\nUrbach-Wiethe disease and the case study of SM-046 are the source of the main plot elements in two stories in ''Movemind'' by author Robert New. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertsnew.com/2018/06/25/whats-my-favourite-piece-of-my-writing/|title=What's my favourite piece of my writing?|author=|date=26 June 2018|website=robertsnew.com|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|title = Movemind|asin = B07BQ9K92J|publisher = Tale Publishing|date = 2018-06-01|language = English|first = Robert|last = New}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S.M.

An example might be a physician working in an [[emergency department]] who receives an unconscious patient wearing a [[medical identification tag]] saying DIABETIC. [[Paramedic]]s may be called to rescue an unconscious person by friends who identify them as diabetic. Brief descriptions of the three major conditions are followed by a discussion of the [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic process]] used to distinguish among them, as well as  a few other conditions which must be considered.\n\nAn estimated 2 to 15 percent of people with diabetes will suffer from at least one episode of diabetic coma in their lifetimes as a result of severe hypoglycemia.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Severe hypoglycemia===\nPeople with [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]] who must take [[insulin]] in full replacement doses are most vulnerable to episodes of [[diabetic hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]]. It is usually mild enough to reverse by eating or drinking [[carbohydrate]]s, but blood [[glucose]] occasionally can fall fast enough and low enough to produce unconsciousness before hypoglycemia can be recognized and reversed. Hypoglycemia can be severe enough to cause unconsciousness during sleep. Predisposing factors can include eating less than usual or prolonged [[exercise]] earlier in the day. Some people with diabetes can lose their ability to recognize the symptoms of early hypoglycemia.\n\nUnconsciousness due to hypoglycemia can occur within 20 minutes to an hour after early symptoms and is not usually preceded by other illness or symptoms. Twitching or [[convulsion]]s may occur. A person unconscious from hypoglycemia is usually pale, has a rapid heart beat, and is soaked in sweat: all signs of the [[adrenaline]] response to hypoglycemia. The individual is not usually dehydrated and breathing is normal or shallow. Their blood sugar level, measured by a [[glucose meter]] or laboratory measurement at the time of discovery, is usually low but not always severely, and in some cases may have already risen from the nadir that triggered the unconsciousness.\n\nUnconsciousness due to hypoglycemia is treated by raising the blood glucose with intravenous glucose or injected [[glucagon]].\n\n===Advanced diabetic ketoacidosis===\n[[Diabetic ketoacidosis]], if it progresses and worsens without treatment, can eventually cause unconsciousness, from a combination of a very high [[blood sugar]] level, [[dehydration]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and exhaustion. Coma only occurs at an advanced stage, usually after 36 hours or more of worsening [[vomiting]] and [[hyperventilation]].\n\nIn the early to middle stages of ketoacidosis, patients are typically flushed and breathing rapidly and deeply, but visible dehydration, [[pallor|pale appearance]] from diminished perfusion, shallower breathing, and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] are often present when coma is reached. However these features are variable and not always as described.\n\nIf the patient is known to have diabetes, the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis is usually suspected from the appearance and a history of 1\u20132 days of vomiting. The diagnosis is confirmed when the usual blood chemistries in the emergency department reveal a high blood sugar level and severe [[metabolic acidosis]].\n\nTreatment of diabetic ketoacidosis consists of isotonic fluids to rapidly stabilize the circulation, continued intravenous [[saline (medicine)|saline]] with [[potassium]] and other electrolytes to replace deficits, insulin to reverse the ketoacidosis, and careful monitoring for complications.\n\n===Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma===\n[[Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]] usually develops more insidiously than diabetic ketoacidosis because the principal symptom is lethargy progressing to [[obtundation]], rather than vomiting and an obvious illness. Extremely high blood sugar levels are accompanied by dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake. Coma occurs most often in patients who have [[type 2 diabetes|type 2]] or [[steroid diabetes]] and have an impaired ability to recognize thirst and drink. It is classically a [[nursing home]] condition but can occur in all ages.\n\nThe diagnosis is usually discovered when a chemistry screen performed because of obtundation reveals an extremely high blood sugar level (often above 1800&nbsp;mg/dl (100 mM)) and dehydration. The treatment consists of insulin and gradual rehydration with intravenous fluids.\n\n===Identifying the cause===\nDiabetic coma was a more significant diagnostic problem before the late 1970s, when glucose meters and rapid blood chemistry analyzers were not available in all hospitals. In modern medical practice, it rarely takes more than a few questions, a quick look, and a glucose meter to determine the cause of unconsciousness in a patient with diabetes. Laboratory confirmation can usually be obtained in half an hour or less.

Rippe|title=Irwin and Rippe's intensive care medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooH1nH81_h4C&pg=PA1256|accessdate=20 November 2010|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9153-3|pages=1256\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThree different types of diabetic coma are identified:\n\n#Severe [[diabetic hypoglycemia|low blood sugar in a diabetic person]]\n#[[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] (usually type 1) advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of a severely [[hyperglycemia|increased blood sugar level]], [[dehydration]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and exhaustion\n#[[Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma]] (usually type 2) in which an extremely high blood sugar level and [[dehydration]] alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.\n\nIn most medical contexts, the term diabetic coma refers to the diagnostical dilemma posed when a physician is confronted with an unconscious patient about whom nothing is known except that they have diabetes. An example might be a physician working in an [[emergency department]] who receives an unconscious patient wearing a [[medical identification tag]] saying DIABETIC. [[Paramedic]]s may be called to rescue an unconscious person by friends who identify them as diabetic. Brief descriptions of the three major conditions are followed by a discussion of the [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic process]] used to distinguish among them, as well as  a few other conditions which must be considered.\n\nAn estimated 2 to 15 percent of people with diabetes will suffer from at least one episode of diabetic coma in their lifetimes as a result of severe hypoglycemia.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Severe hypoglycemia===\nPeople with [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]] who must take [[insulin]] in full replacement doses are most vulnerable to episodes of [[diabetic hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia]]. It is usually mild enough to reverse by eating or drinking [[carbohydrate]]s, but blood [[glucose]] occasionally can fall fast enough and low enough to produce unconsciousness before hypoglycemia can be recognized and reversed. Hypoglycemia can be severe enough to cause unconsciousness during sleep. Predisposing factors can include eating less than usual or prolonged [[exercise]] earlier in the day. Some people with diabetes can lose their ability to recognize the symptoms of early hypoglycemia.\n\nUnconsciousness due to hypoglycemia can occur within 20 minutes to an hour after early symptoms and is not usually preceded by other illness or symptoms. Twitching or [[convulsion]]s may occur. A person unconscious from hypoglycemia is usually pale, has a rapid heart beat, and is soaked in sweat: all signs of the [[adrenaline]] response to hypoglycemia. The individual is not usually dehydrated and breathing is normal or shallow. Their blood sugar level, measured by a [[glucose meter]] or laboratory measurement at the time of discovery, is usually low but not always severely, and in some cases may have already risen from the nadir that triggered the unconsciousness.\n\nUnconsciousness due to hypoglycemia is treated by raising the blood glucose with intravenous glucose or injected [[glucagon]].\n\n===Advanced diabetic ketoacidosis===\n[[Diabetic ketoacidosis]], if it progresses and worsens without treatment, can eventually cause unconsciousness, from a combination of a very high [[blood sugar]] level, [[dehydration]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and exhaustion. Coma only occurs at an advanced stage, usually after 36 hours or more of worsening [[vomiting]] and [[hyperventilation]].\n\nIn the early to middle stages of ketoacidosis, patients are typically flushed and breathing rapidly and deeply, but visible dehydration, [[pallor|pale appearance]] from diminished perfusion, shallower breathing, and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] are often present when coma is reached. However these features are variable and not always as described.\n\nIf the patient is known to have diabetes, the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis is usually suspected from the appearance and a history of 1\u20132 days of vomiting. The diagnosis is confirmed when the usual blood chemistries in the emergency department reveal a high blood sugar level and severe [[metabolic acidosis]].\n\nTreatment of diabetic ketoacidosis consists of isotonic fluids to rapidly stabilize the circulation, continued intravenous [[saline (medicine)|saline]] with [[potassium]] and other electrolytes to replace deficits, insulin to reverse the ketoacidosis, and careful monitoring for complications.\n\n===Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma===\n[[Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma]] usually develops more insidiously than diabetic ketoacidosis because the principal symptom is lethargy progressing to [[obtundation]], rather than vomiting and an obvious illness. Extremely high blood sugar levels are accompanied by dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake. Coma occurs most often in patients who have [[type 2 diabetes|type 2]] or [[steroid diabetes]] and have an impaired ability to recognize thirst and drink. It is classically a [[nursing home]] condition but can occur in all ages.\n\nThe diagnosis is usually discovered when a chemistry screen performed because of obtundation reveals an extremely high blood sugar level (often above 1800&nbsp;mg/dl (100 mM)) and dehydration. The treatment consists of insulin and gradual rehydration with intravenous fluids.\n\n===Identifying the cause===\nDiabetic coma was a more significant diagnostic problem before the late 1970s, when glucose meters and rapid blood chemistry analyzers were not available in all hospitals. In modern medical practice, it rarely takes more than a few questions, a quick look, and a glucose meter to determine the cause of unconsciousness in a patient with diabetes. Laboratory confirmation can usually be obtained in half an hour or less. Other conditions that can cause unconsciousness in a person with diabetes are stroke, uremic encephalopathy, alcohol, drug overdose, head injury, or seizure.\n\nMost patients do not reach the point of unconsciousness or coma in cases of diabetic hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or severe hyperosmolarity before a family member or caretaker seeks medical help.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment depends upon the underlying cause:\n\n* Hypoglycaemic diabetic coma: administration of the hormone [[glucagon]] to reverse the effects of insulin, or glucose given intravenously.\n* Ketoacidotic diabetic coma: [[intravenous fluids]], [[insulin]] and administration of [[potassium]] and [[sodium]].\n* Hyperosmolar diabetic coma: plenty of intravenous fluids, insulin, potassium and sodium given as soon as possible.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   ICD10       = E10.0, E11.0, E12.0, E13.0, E14.0 \n|   ICD9        = {{ICD9|250.2}}, {{ICD9|250.3}} \n|   MeshID        = D003926 \n}}\n{{Endocrine pathology}}\n{{Diabetes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diabetic Coma}}\n[[Category:Medical emergencies]]\n[[Category:Diabetes]]\n[[Category:Coma]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_coma"}

There are two churches in the town and a monastery outside it:\n\n* '''Orthodox Church \"St. Dimitar\"''' ([[St. Demetrius]]) in the upper quarter of the city. The construction of the church was begun by master [[Kolyu Ficheto]] (Nikola Fichev), but shortly afterwards he fell ill and the construction was continued by one of his best students - Gencho Novakov. The alst is also the author of the [[iconostasis]]. The church is unique in terms of architecture and was declared a monument of culture. The foundation stone of the temple was laid in the 1880s, and the consecration took place in 1891 on St. Demetrius' Day.\n* '''Orthodox Church \"Assumption of the Virgin Mary\"'''.\n* '''Monastery \"[[St. Nicholas]]\"''' . The Saint Nicholas Maglizh Monastery (\u201cSaint Nicholas of the Fog Monastery\u201d) is located a mile north of the city Maglizh on the slopes of the Central Balkans, 13&nbsp;km east of the city [[Kazanlak]] and 33&nbsp;km from the city of [[Stara Zagora]]. The monastery complex includes a church, living quarters, stables, and two chapels \u2013 The [[Saints Peter]] and Paul Chapel and The Archangel Michael Chapel. The monastery is recognized by all three of these names: The Saint Nicholas Monastery, The Saints Peter and Paul Monastery, and The [[Archangel Michael]] Monastery. The oldest object at the monastery is a censer on which there is a Greek inscription dated 1233, which was during the reign of [[Tsar Ivan-Asen]] (reign 1218-1241), so the history of the monastery has some connection with the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (1185-1393).\nAfter the invasion of the Ottoman Turks during the 14th century, the monastery was often plundered and burned, and then rebuilt. In 1834, the current church at the monastery was erected, which is a single-nave, single-apse construction without a cupola. A point of interest in the church is that some of the Bulgarian saints depicted by the masters on the church's icons are wearing traditional Bulgarian clothing. During the [[Russo-Turkish war]] (1877-1888), the [[Ottomans]] again set fire to the monastery, but the local residents were able to rebuild it in just a year and a half. The monastery maintained a school for rug weaving, and it also provided shelter for revolutionaries who fought to liberate the country from the Ottomans. [[Vasil Levski]] (1837-1873), known as an apostle of the Bulgarian revolution, stayed at the monastery on several occasions.
