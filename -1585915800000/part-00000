Kabane studied at Heald-town, and was one of the first students to enroll at Fort Hare, earning a bachelor's degree in 1925.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\nKabane started his career as a teacher and later taught at Lovedale College, near Alice. After many years at Lovedale College, he was anointed as the first African principal of the college. At the helm of the college, some white colleagues did not take it kindly to be led by an African. After few months he relocated to Bloemfontein and stayed on the same street as Mr. T. M. Mapikela, Honorary Life Speaker, A.N.C., Executive member of the [[African National Congress]]. <ref>, Andre (2012).

He was instrumental in organising and formulating the first version of a document titled ''Bill of Rights'' and ''the Atlantic Charter from the African\u2019s  Point of View''. He organised the meeting logistics (booking of the hall, communication with delegates, etc.) with his wife Helena Villa Kabane reporting directly to [[Alfred Bitini Xuma|, Dr. A.B. Xuma]], President of the ANC.\n\nThe 28 member Committee met at Bloemfontein and deliberated on the [[Atlantic Charter]] on Monday and Tuesday, December 13 and 14, 1943. The Committee elected Mr. Z.K. Matthews as Chairman and Mr. L.T. Mtimkulu as Secretary, and a Sub-Committee consisting of Messrs. S.B. Ngcobo, M.L. Kabane, and J.M. Nhlapo, with the chairman and the secretary as ex officio members, to draft the findings of the Atlantic Charter Committee. The main task of the committee was to (1) consider and interpret the Atlantic Charter, and (2) formulate the Bill of Rights. Their findings were unanimously adopted by the Annual Conference of the African National Congress at Bloemfontein, on the 16th of December, 1943.<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/african-claims-south-africa-dr-xuma-anc-conference-1943</ref>\nThe full document is available in the ANC archives<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120314020527/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4474&t=The</ref> Early Years\n\nMilner Langa Kabane was also identified by international academics and philosophers like W.E.B. Du Bois, who coined freedom phrases as used by Bob Marley, \"Free yourself from mental slavery\". W.E.B. Du Bois is internationally recognised for leading the Pan Africanist agenda. He sent invitation letters to Dr. A. Abdurrahman, 1921, Du Bois Papers inviting them to the Pan African Congress planned for December 1929 in Tunis. Other invitations were also forwarded to John L.

Kabane studied at Heald-town, and was one of the first students to enroll at Fort Hare, earning a bachelor's degree in 1925.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\nKabane started his career as a teacher and later taught at Lovedale College, near Alice. After many years at Lovedale College, he was anointed as the first African principal of the college. At the helm of the college, some white colleagues did not take it kindly to be led by an African. After few months he relocated to Bloemfontein and stayed on the same street as Mr. T. M. Mapikela, Honorary Life Speaker, A.N.C., Executive member of the [[African National Congress]]. <ref>, Andre (2012).

ISBN 9781431402915.</ref>\nKabane was the president of (1) the Orange Free State Teachers' Association, (2) a member of the Africans' Claims committee and the (3) Orange Free State All African Convention (AAC) executive committee. He was instrumental in organising and formulating the first version of a document titled ''Bill of Rights'' and ''the Atlantic Charter from the African\u2019s  Point of View''. He organised the meeting logistics (booking of the hall, communication with delegates, etc.) with his wife Helena Villa Kabane reporting directly to [[Alfred Bitini Xuma|, Dr. A.B. Xuma]], President of the ANC.\n\nThe 28 member Committee met at Bloemfontein and deliberated on the [[Atlantic Charter]] on Monday and Tuesday, December 13 and 14, 1943. The Committee elected Mr. Z.K. Matthews as Chairman and Mr. L.T. Mtimkulu as Secretary, and a Sub-Committee consisting of Messrs. S.B. Ngcobo, M.L. Kabane, and J.M. Nhlapo, with the chairman and the secretary as ex officio members, to draft the findings of the Atlantic Charter Committee. The main task of the committee was to (1) consider and interpret the Atlantic Charter, and (2) formulate the Bill of Rights. Their findings were unanimously adopted by the Annual Conference of the African National Congress at Bloemfontein, on the 16th of December, 1943.<ref>https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/african-claims-south-africa-dr-xuma-anc-conference-1943</ref>\nThe full document is available in the ANC archives<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120314020527/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4474&t=The</ref>Early Years\n\nMilner Langa Kabane was also identified by international academics and philosophers like W.E.B. Du Bois, who coined freedom phrases as used by Bob Marley, \"Free yourself from mental slavery\". W.E.B. Du Bois is internationally recognised for leading the Pan Africanist agenda. He sent invitation letters to Dr. A. Abdurrahman, 1921, Du Bois Papers inviting them to the Pan African Congress planned for December 1929 in Tunis. Other invitations were also forwarded to John L. Dube, D. D. T. Jabavu, Milner Kabane of Imvo Zabantu as they were recognised as progressive South African Political leaders. \n\nHe died in Bloemfontein in 1945.\n\n== References ==\n\n# South African Minister of Higher Education Naledi Pandor speeches, 4 November 2004.\n# Gerhart G.M and Karis T.

An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name, but they declared bankruptcy on April 1, 1975, and it closed again.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31, 1975, for $400,000 and sold it to his son-in-law, Jack A.

The General Manager of the time, Frank Schutt, had just returned from a weekend hunting trip in Arkansas. He and his friends found it amusing to leave three of their live English [[Call Duck]] decoys in the hotel fountain. The guests loved the idea, and since then, five [[Mallard]] ducks (one drake and four hens) have played in the fountain every day.<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" />\n\n[[File:20150521 The Peabody Hotel lobby and ducks (6).JPG|thumb|Duckmaster giving the ducks a feeding|left|upright]]\nIn 1940, a [[Bellhop|Bellman]] by the name of Edward Pembroke volunteered to care for the ducks. Pembroke was given the position of \"Duckmaster\" and served in that position until 1991. As a former circus animal trainer, he taught the ducks to march into the hotel lobby, which started the famous Peabody Duck March.<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" /> Every day at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., the Peabody Ducks are escorted from their penthouse home, on the Rooftop, to the lobby via elevator. The ducks, accompanied by the [[King Cotton March]] by [[John Philip Sousa]], then proceed across a [[red carpet]] to the hotel [[fountain]], made of a solid block of Italian [[travertine|travertine marble]]. The ducks are then ceremoniously led back to their penthouse at 5:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodymemphis.com/peabody_hotels/the_peabody_ducks.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028132534/http://www.peabodymemphis.com/peabody_hotels/the_peabody_ducks.cfm|url-status=dead|title=The Peabody Ducks|archivedate=October 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, The Peabody Ducks have gained celebrity status with television appearances (along with their Duckmaster) on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', sitcom ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

If this floor were numbered, one would press \"13\" to reach it, but due to superstitions regarding the number thirteen, management decided to call the top floor \"the Skyway.\"\n\n==Radio and television==\nThe studios of radio station [[WREC]] and later its television spinoff [[WREG|WREC-TV (now WREG)]] were for many years located in the hotel basement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wreg.com/the-history-of-wreg-tv/ |title=The History Of WREG-TV |publisher=Wreg.com |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> During the [[Big Band]] era, the Skyway was a popular night-spot, and the ballroom was one of only a handful of sites in America from which the [[CBS]] radio network would broadcast live weekly programs.

An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name, but they declared bankruptcy on April 1, 1975, and it closed again.<ref name=\"historic-memphis.com\"/> Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31, 1975, for $400,000 and sold it to his son-in-law, Jack A. Belz, for the same amount. Belz spent the next several years and $25 million renovating the landmark structure. The grand reopening in 1981 is widely considered a major catalyst for the Memphis downtown area's ongoing revitalization.\n\nThe Peabody Hotel is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==Peabody Hotel Group==\nThe Peabody Hotel Group (PHG) operated two additional properties under the Peabody name for many years. The Peabody Orlando, near [[Orlando, Florida]], opened in 1986 as the second Peabody Hotel. It was sold on August 28, 2013 and was renamed [[Hyatt Regency Orlando]] on October 1, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article73579.html|title=The Peabody Orlando Sold to Hyatt for $717 Million|author=Hotel News Resource|date=29 August 2013|work=hotelnewsresource.com}}</ref> PHG operated a third hotel in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] from 2002, when they assumed management of the former Excelsior Hotel, which was known as The Peabody Little Rock until 2013, when the property became a Marriott.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Little-Rock-s-Peabody-changing-to-Marriott-4477055.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501005714/http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Little-Rock-s-Peabody-changing-to-Marriott-4477055.php |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref> They also operated properties for a number of years under the Hilton name in Greenville, South Carolina and Little Rock, Arkansas.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Peabody Ducks ==\n {{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Peabody Hotel Ducks.jpg\n | width1 = 200\n | image2 = 20150521 The Peabody Hotel lobby and ducks (3).JPG\n | width2 = 225\n | footer_align = center\n | footer = The Peabody Ducks in the Fountain\n}}\n\nThe Peabody is probably best known for a custom dating back to the 1930s. The General Manager of the time, Frank Schutt, had just returned from a weekend hunting trip in Arkansas. He and his friends found it amusing to leave three of their live English [[Call Duck]] decoys in the hotel fountain. The guests loved the idea, and since then, five [[Mallard]] ducks (one drake and four hens) have played in the fountain every day.<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" />\n\n[[File:20150521 The Peabody Hotel lobby and ducks (6).JPG|thumb|Duckmaster giving the ducks a feeding|left|upright]]\nIn 1940, a [[Bellhop|Bellman]] by the name of Edward Pembroke volunteered to care for the ducks. Pembroke was given the position of \"Duckmaster\" and served in that position until 1991. As a former circus animal trainer, he taught the ducks to march into the hotel lobby, which started the famous Peabody Duck March.<ref name=\"PEABODYHIST\" /> Every day at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., the Peabody Ducks are escorted from their penthouse home, on the Rooftop, to the lobby via elevator. The ducks, accompanied by the [[King Cotton March]] by [[John Philip Sousa]], then proceed across a [[red carpet]] to the hotel [[fountain]], made of a solid block of Italian [[travertine|travertine marble]]. The ducks are then ceremoniously led back to their penthouse at 5:00&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodymemphis.com/peabody_hotels/the_peabody_ducks.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028132534/http://www.peabodymemphis.com/peabody_hotels/the_peabody_ducks.cfm|url-status=dead|title=The Peabody Ducks|archivedate=October 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, The Peabody Ducks have gained celebrity status with television appearances (along with their Duckmaster) on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', sitcom ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

The 24 by 12 foot enclosure features granite flooring, ceiling fans, a scale replica of the hotel, a fountain decorated with a pair of bronze ducks, and a large viewing window for guests to see them in their new home.

If this floor were numbered, one would press \"13\" to reach it, but due to superstitions regarding the number thirteen, management decided to call the top floor \"the Skyway.\"\n\n==Radio and television==\nThe studios of radio station [[WREC]] and later its television spinoff [[WREG|WREC-TV (now WREG)]] were for many years located in the hotel basement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wreg.com/the-history-of-wreg-tv/ |title=The History Of WREG-TV |publisher=Wreg.com |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> During the [[Big Band]] era, the Skyway was a popular night-spot, and the ballroom was one of only a handful of sites in America from which the [[CBS]] radio network would broadcast live weekly programs.

In 2008 [[Jeronimas Milius]] failed to reach the final, coming 16th of 19 competing nations in the second semi-final.\n\nLithuania threatened to boycott the 2009 contest \"if Russia continues to showcase power and ignores international law\".

When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. Unlike most [[Organism|living things]], viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell. But unlike simpler infectious agents like [[prion]]s, they contain [[Introduction to genetics|genes]], which allow them to mutate and evolve. Over 4,800 species of viruses have been [[List of virus taxa|described in detail]]<ref name=\"pmid29754305\">{{cite journal |vauthors=King AM, Lefkowitz EJ, Mushegian AR, Adams MJ, Dutilh BE, Gorbalenya AE, Harrach B, Harrison RL, Junglen S, Knowles NJ, Kropinski AM, Krupovic M, Kuhn JH, Nibert ML, Rubino L, Sabanadzovic S, Sanfa\u00e7on H, Siddell SG, Simmonds P, Varsani A, Zerbini FM, Davison AJ |title=Changes to taxonomy and the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature ratified by the International Committee Taxonomy of Viruses (2018) |journal=Archives of Virology |volume=163 |issue=9 |pages=2601\u201331 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29754305 |doi=10.1007/s00705-018-3847-1 |url=https://hal-pasteur.archives-ouvertes.fr/pasteur-01977332/file/King2018_Article_ChangesToTaxonomyAndTheInterna.pdf}}</ref> out of the millions in the environment. Their origin is unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from [[bacteria]].\n\nViruses are made of either two or three parts. All include [[gene]]s. These genes contain the encoded biological information of the virus and are built from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. All viruses are also covered with a [[protein]] coat to protect the genes. Some viruses may also have an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[Lipid|fat-like substance]] that covers the protein coat, and makes them vulnerable to soap. A virus with this \"viral envelope\" uses it\u2014along with specific [[Cell surface receptor|receptors]]\u2014to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 [[nanometre]]s; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm|1}}.\n\nViruses spread in many ways. Although many are very specific about which host species or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] they attack, each [[species]] of virus relies on a particular method to copy itself. [[Plant pathology#Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms|Plant viruses]] are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other [[organism]]s, known as ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]''. Some [[Virus#Role in human disease|viruses of humans]] and other animals are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as [[influenza]] are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as [[norovirus]] are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, [[HIV]], is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the [[dengue virus]], are spread by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking insects]].\n\nViruses, especially those made of RNA, can [[Mutation|mutate]] rapidly to give rise to new types. Hosts may have little [[Immunity (medical)|protection]] against such new forms. Influenza virus, for example, changes often, so a new [[vaccine]] is needed each year. Major changes can cause [[pandemic]]s, as in the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 swine influenza]] that spread to most countries. Often, these mutations take place when the virus has first infected other animal hosts. Some examples of such [[Zoonosis|\"zoonotic\" diseases]] include [[coronavirus]] in bats, and influenza in pigs and birds, before those viruses were [[Cross-species transmission|transferred to humans]].\n\nViral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and plants. In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the [[immune system]], which can provide lifetime [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the host for that virus. [[Antibiotic]]s, which work against [[bacteria]], have no impact, but [[antiviral drug]]s can treat life-threatening infections. Those vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some infections.\n{{Virus glossary}}\n\n== Discovery ==\n{{Main|History of virology}}\n[[File:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a [[lymphocyte]]]]\n\nIn 1884, French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented the [[Chamberland filter]] (or Chamberland\u2013Pasteur filter), that contains pores smaller than [[bacteria]]. He could then pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter, and completely remove them. In the early 1890s, Russian [[biologist]] [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] used this method to study what became known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.<ref>Shors p. 6</ref>\n\nAt the same time, several other scientists showed that, although these agents (later called viruses) were different from bacteria and about one hundred times smaller, they could still cause disease. In 1899, Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] observed that the agent only multiplied when in [[cell division|dividing cells]]. He called it a \"contagious living fluid\" ({{lang-la|text= [[contagium vivum fluidum]]}})\u2014or a \"soluble living germ\" because he could not find any germ-like particles.<ref>Collier p. 3</ref> In the early 20th century, English [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]] discovered viruses that infect bacteria,<ref>Shors p. 827</ref> and French-Canadian microbiologist [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria.

Eventually, the genes they no longer needed for a parasitic way of life were lost. The bacteria ''[[Rickettsia]]'' and ''[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]]'' are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. This lends credence to this theory, as their dependence on being parasites may have led to the loss of the genes that once allowed them to live on their own.<ref>Collier p. 11</ref>\n\n; Cellular origin theory : Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that \"escaped\" from the genes of a larger organism.

The regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way.

The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.<ref>Shors p. 81</ref>\n\nViruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and [[rotavirus]] has eleven. In comparison, humans have 20,000\u201325,000. Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle. Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects.<ref>Shors p. 129</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | last1 = International Human | first1 = Genome Sequencing Consortium | year = 2004 | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome |  journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011| pages = 931\u201345 | pmid = 15496913 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}</ref>\n\nAll cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are [[enzyme]]s that drive chemical reactions. Some of these enzymes, called [[DNA polymerase]] and [[RNA polymerase]],  make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the equivalent enzymes of the host cells,<ref>Shors pp. 129\u201331</ref>  but viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error-prone, causing RNA viruses to mutate and form new strains.<ref>Shors p. 652</ref>\n\nIn some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called [[reassortment]].<ref>Shors p. 654</ref>\n\n=== Protein synthesis ===\n[[File:Cell with Virus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]] (14) a virus shown to approximate scale]]\n\nProteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. [[Protein biosynthesis|Protein synthesis]] consists of two major steps: [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]].<ref name=\"pmid25648499\">{{cite journal |vauthors=de Klerk E, 't Hoen PA |title=Alternative mRNA transcription, processing, and translation: insights from RNA sequencing |journal=Trends in Genetics : TIG |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=128\u201339 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25648499 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2015.01.001 |url=}}</ref>\n\nTranscription is the process where information in DNA, called the [[genetic code]], is used to produce RNA copies called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to [[ribosome]]s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's [[amino acid]] structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.<ref name=\"pmid25648499\" />\n\nSome nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.<ref>Collier pp. 75\u201382</ref> In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called [[retrovirus]]es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.<ref>Shors p. 698</ref>\n\n== Life-cycle ==\n{{Main|Viral life cycle|Viral entry}}\n\n[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|Life-cycle of a typical virus (left to right); following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released.]]\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.<ref>Shors pp. 6\u201313</ref>\n\nThere are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:<ref>Shors pp. 121\u201323</ref>\n\n*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human [[T cell]]s, because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.\n*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell.\n*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.\n*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.\n*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.\n*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding#Via budding|budding]].\n\n== Effects on the host cell ==\nViruses have an extensive range of structural and biochemical effects on the host cell.<ref>Collier pp. 115\u201346</ref> These are called ''[[Cytopathic effect|cytopathic effects]]''.<ref>Collier p. 115</ref> Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell.

Plant viruses are frequently spread from plant to plant by organisms called \"[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]\". These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[nematode]] worms and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have also been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 822</ref> Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 802\u201303</ref>\n\n=== Bacteriophages ===\n{{Main|Bacteriophage}}\n\n[[File:PhageExterior.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and [[archaea]]. The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families.<ref>{{vcite book |vauthor=Fauquet CM |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=82 |isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}</ref> They are important in [[marine ecology]]: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.<ref>Shors p. 803</ref>\n\n=== Host resistance ===\n\n==== Innate immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Innate immunity}}\n\nAnimals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This [[innate]] immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a \"memory\" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called [[interferon]] is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cells and their close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called [[RNA interference]]. Some blood cells [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and destroy other virus-infected cells.<ref>Shors pp. 116\u201317</ref>\n\n==== Adaptive immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Immune response}}\n[[File:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|thumb|left|Two rotavirus particles: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]\n\nSpecific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a \"memory\" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called [[antibody|antibodies]]. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection. After the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, usually giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.<ref>Shors pp. 225\u201333</ref>\n\n==== Plant resistance ====\nPlants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called [[Gene-for-gene relationship#Classes of resistance gene|resistance (R) genes]]. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots.

Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogue]]s, which masquerade as DNA building blocks ([[nucleoside]]s). When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of the fake building blocks are used. This prevents DNA replication because the drugs lack the essential features that allow the formation of a DNA chain.

When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. Unlike most [[Organism|living things]], viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell. But unlike simpler infectious agents like [[prion]]s, they contain [[Introduction to genetics|genes]], which allow them to mutate and evolve.

Their origin is unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from [[bacteria]].\n\nViruses are made of either two or three parts. All include [[gene]]s. These genes contain the encoded biological information of the virus and are built from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. All viruses are also covered with a [[protein]] coat to protect the genes. Some viruses may also have an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[Lipid|fat-like substance]] that covers the protein coat, and makes them vulnerable to soap. A virus with this \"viral envelope\" uses it\u2014along with specific [[Cell surface receptor|receptors]]\u2014to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 [[nanometre]]s; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm|1}}.\n\nViruses spread in many ways. Although many are very specific about which host species or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] they attack, each [[species]] of virus relies on a particular method to copy itself. [[Plant pathology#Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms|Plant viruses]] are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other [[organism]]s, known as ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]''. Some [[Virus#Role in human disease|viruses of humans]] and other animals are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as [[influenza]] are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as [[norovirus]] are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, [[HIV]], is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the [[dengue virus]], are spread by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking insects]].\n\nViruses, especially those made of RNA, can [[Mutation|mutate]] rapidly to give rise to new types. Hosts may have little [[Immunity (medical)|protection]] against such new forms. Influenza virus, for example, changes often, so a new [[vaccine]] is needed each year. Major changes can cause [[pandemic]]s, as in the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 swine influenza]] that spread to most countries. Often, these mutations take place when the virus has first infected other animal hosts. Some examples of such [[Zoonosis|\"zoonotic\" diseases]] include [[coronavirus]] in bats, and influenza in pigs and birds, before those viruses were [[Cross-species transmission|transferred to humans]].\n\nViral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and plants. In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the [[immune system]], which can provide lifetime [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the host for that virus. [[Antibiotic]]s, which work against [[bacteria]], have no impact, but [[antiviral drug]]s can treat life-threatening infections. Those vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some infections.\n{{Virus glossary}}\n\n== Discovery ==\n{{Main|History of virology}}\n[[File:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a [[lymphocyte]]]]\n\nIn 1884, French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented the [[Chamberland filter]] (or Chamberland\u2013Pasteur filter), that contains pores smaller than [[bacteria]]. He could then pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter, and completely remove them. In the early 1890s, Russian [[biologist]] [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] used this method to study what became known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.<ref>Shors p. 6</ref>\n\nAt the same time, several other scientists showed that, although these agents (later called viruses) were different from bacteria and about one hundred times smaller, they could still cause disease. In 1899, Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] observed that the agent only multiplied when in [[cell division|dividing cells]]. He called it a \"contagious living fluid\" ({{lang-la|text= [[contagium vivum fluidum]]}})\u2014or a \"soluble living germ\" because he could not find any germ-like particles.<ref>Collier p. 3</ref> In the early 20th century, English [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]] discovered viruses that infect bacteria,<ref>Shors p. 827</ref> and French-Canadian microbiologist [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria.

The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.<ref>Shors p. 81</ref>\n\nViruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and [[rotavirus]] has eleven. In comparison, humans have 20,000\u201325,000. Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle. Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects.<ref>Shors p. 129</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | last1 = International Human | first1 = Genome Sequencing Consortium | year = 2004 | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome |  journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011| pages = 931\u201345 | pmid = 15496913 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}</ref>\n\nAll cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are [[enzyme]]s that drive chemical reactions. Some of these enzymes, called [[DNA polymerase]] and [[RNA polymerase]],  make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the equivalent enzymes of the host cells,<ref>Shors pp. 129\u201331</ref>  but viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error-prone, causing RNA viruses to mutate and form new strains.<ref>Shors p. 652</ref>\n\nIn some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called [[reassortment]].<ref>Shors p. 654</ref>\n\n=== Protein synthesis ===\n[[File:Cell with Virus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]] (14) a virus shown to approximate scale]]\n\nProteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. [[Protein biosynthesis|Protein synthesis]] consists of two major steps: [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]].<ref name=\"pmid25648499\">{{cite journal |vauthors=de Klerk E, 't Hoen PA |title=Alternative mRNA transcription, processing, and translation: insights from RNA sequencing |journal=Trends in Genetics : TIG |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=128\u201339 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25648499 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2015.01.001 |url=}}</ref>\n\nTranscription is the process where information in DNA, called the [[genetic code]], is used to produce RNA copies called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to [[ribosome]]s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's [[amino acid]] structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.<ref name=\"pmid25648499\" />\n\nSome nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.<ref>Collier pp. 75\u201382</ref> In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called [[retrovirus]]es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.<ref>Shors p. 698</ref>\n\n== Life-cycle ==\n{{Main|Viral life cycle|Viral entry}}\n\n[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|Life-cycle of a typical virus (left to right); following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released.]]\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.<ref>Shors pp. 6\u201313</ref>\n\nThere are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:<ref>Shors pp. 121\u201323</ref>\n\n*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human [[T cell]]s, because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.\n*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell.\n*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.\n*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.\n*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.\n*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding#Via budding|budding]].\n\n== Effects on the host cell ==\nViruses have an extensive range of structural and biochemical effects on the host cell.<ref>Collier pp. 115\u201346</ref> These are called ''[[Cytopathic effect|cytopathic effects]]''.<ref>Collier p. 115</ref> Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell.

Plant viruses are frequently spread from plant to plant by organisms called \"[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]\". These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[nematode]] worms and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have also been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 822</ref> Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 802\u201303</ref>\n\n=== Bacteriophages ===\n{{Main|Bacteriophage}}\n\n[[File:PhageExterior.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and [[archaea]]. The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families.<ref>{{vcite book |vauthor=Fauquet CM |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=82 |isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}</ref> They are important in [[marine ecology]]: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.<ref>Shors p. 803</ref>\n\n=== Host resistance ===\n\n==== Innate immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Innate immunity}}\n\nAnimals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This [[innate]] immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a \"memory\" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called [[interferon]] is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cells and their close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called [[RNA interference]]. Some blood cells [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and destroy other virus-infected cells.<ref>Shors pp. 116\u201317</ref>\n\n==== Adaptive immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Immune response}}\n[[File:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|thumb|left|Two rotavirus particles: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]\n\nSpecific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a \"memory\" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called [[antibody|antibodies]]. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection. After the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, usually giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.<ref>Shors pp. 225\u201333</ref>\n\n==== Plant resistance ====\nPlants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called [[Gene-for-gene relationship#Classes of resistance gene|resistance (R) genes]]. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.<ref name=\"pmid30201857\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia-Ruiz H |title=Susceptibility Genes to Plant Viruses |journal=Viruses |volume=10 |issue=9 |year= 2018 |pages=484 |pmid=30201857 |pmc=6164914 |doi=10.3390/v10090484}}</ref> RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.<ref>Shors p. 812</ref> When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that destroy viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1239 | vauthors = Soosaar JL, Burch-Smith TM, Dinesh-Kumar SP | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 789\u201398 | pmid = 16132037 }}</ref>\n\n==== Resistance to bacteriophages ====\nThe major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA.

Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogue]]s, which masquerade as DNA building blocks ([[nucleoside]]s). When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of the fake building blocks are used. This prevents DNA replication because the drugs lack the essential features that allow the formation of a DNA chain. When DNA production stops the virus can no longer reproduce.<ref>Shors pp. 514\u201315</ref> Examples of nucleoside analogues are [[aciclovir]] for [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus]] infections and [[lamivudine]] for HIV and [[hepatitis B virus]] infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.<ref>Shors p. 514</ref>\n\nOther antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]], which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.<ref name=\"Shors p. 463\">Shors p. 568</ref>\n\nHepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of those infected, the disease becomes [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated.

Classical music has a lighter, clearer texture than Baroque music and is less complex. It is mainly [[homophonic]], using a clear [[melody]] line over a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]],<ref name=Blume>[[Friedrich Blume|Blume, Friedrich]]. ''Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey''. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1970</ref> but [[counterpoint]] was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. It also makes use of ''[[Galant music|style galant]]'' which emphasized light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur. Variety and contrast within a piece became more pronounced than before and the [[orchestra]] increased in size, range, and power.\n\nThe [[harpsichord]] was replaced as the main keyboard instrument by the [[piano]] (or [[fortepiano]]). Unlike the harpsichord, which plucks strings with quills, pianos strike the strings with leather-covered hammers when the keys are pressed, which enables the performer to play louder or softer (hence the original name \"fortepiano,\" literally \"loud soft\") and play with more expression; in contrast, the force with which a performer plays the harpsichord keys does not change the sound. Instrumental music was considered important by Classical period composers. The main kinds of instrumental music were the [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]] (performed by an orchestra) and the solo [[concerto]], which featured a virtuoso solo performer playing a solo work for violin, piano, flute, or another instrument, accompanied by an orchestra. Vocal music, such as [[art song|songs for a singer and piano]] (notably the work of Schubert), [[Choir|choral works]], and [[opera]] (a staged dramatic work for singers and orchestra) were also important during this period.\n\nThe best-known composers from this period are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]]; other notable names include [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], [[Leopold Mozart]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] is regarded either as a Romantic composer or a Classical period composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic era. [[Franz Schubert]] is also a transitional figure, as were [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Gaspare Spontini]], [[Gioachino Rossini]],  [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of ''Viennese Classic'' or ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Wiener Klassik|link=no}}), since Gluck, Mozart, Haydn, Salieri, Schubert, and Beethoven all worked in [[Vienna]].\n\n== Classicism ==\n{{Classicism}}\nIn the middle of the 18th century, Europe began to move toward a new style in [[architecture]], literature, and the arts, generally known as [[Classicism]]. This style sought to emulate the ideals of [[Classical antiquity]], especially those of [[Classical Greece]].<ref name=\"Kamien\">[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]]. Music: An Appreciation. 6th. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.</ref> Classical music used formality and emphasis on order and hierarchy, and a \"clearer\", \"cleaner\" style that used clearer divisions between parts (notably a clear, single melody accompanied by chords), brighter contrasts and \"tone colors\" (achieved by the use of dynamic changes and [[modulation (music)|modulations]] to more keys). In contrast with the richly layered music of the Baroque era, Classical music moved towards simplicity rather than complexity. In addition, the typical size of orchestras began to increase,<ref name=\"Kamien\"/> giving orchestras a more powerful sound.\n\nThe remarkable development of ideas in \"[[natural philosophy]]\" had already established itself in the public consciousness. In particular, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[physics]] was taken as a paradigm: structures should be well-founded in [[axiom]]s and be both well-articulated and orderly. This taste for structural clarity began to affect music, which moved away from the layered [[polyphony]] of the Baroque period toward a style known as [[homophony]], in which the [[melody]] is played over a subordinate [[harmony]].<ref name=\"Kamien\"/> This move meant that [[Chord (music)|chords]] became a much more prevalent feature of music, even if they interrupted the melodic smoothness of a single part. As a result, the [[tonality|tonal]] structure of a piece of music became [[counterpoint|more audible]].\n\nThe new style was also encouraged by changes in the economic order and social structure. As the 18th century progressed, the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music, while public taste increasingly preferred lighter, funny [[comic opera]]s. This led to changes in the way music was performed, the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the ''[[basso continuo|continuo]]''\u2014the rhythmic and harmonic groundwork of a piece of music, typically played by a keyboard ([[harpsichord]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]) and usually accompanied by a varied group of bass instruments, including [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[bass viol]], and [[theorbo]]. One way to trace the decline of the continuo and its [[figured bass|figured]] chords is to examine the disappearance of the term ''[[obbligato]]'', meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of [[chamber music]]. In Baroque compositions, additional instruments could be added to the continuo group according to the group or leader's preference; in Classical compositions, all parts were specifically noted, though not always ''notated'', so the term \"obbligato\" became redundant. By 1800, basso continuo was practically extinct, except for the occasional use of a [[pipe organ]] continuo part in a religious [[Mass (music)|Mass]] in the early 1800s.\n\nEconomic changes also had the effect of altering the balance of availability and quality of musicians. While in the late Baroque, a major composer would have the entire musical resources of a town to draw on, the musical forces available at an aristocratic hunting lodge or small court were smaller and more fixed in their level of ability. This was a spur to having simpler parts for ensemble musicians to play, and in the case of a resident virtuoso group, a spur to writing spectacular, idiomatic parts for certain instruments, as in the case of the [[Mannheim orchestra]], or virtuoso solo parts for particularly skilled violinists or flautists. In addition, the appetite by audiences for a continual supply of new music carried over from the Baroque. This meant that works had to be performable with, at best, one or two rehearsals. Even after 1790 Mozart writes about \"the rehearsal\", with the implication that his concerts would have only one rehearsal.\n\nSince there was a greater emphasis on a single melodic line, there was greater emphasis on notating that line for [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and phrasing. This contrasts with the Baroque era, when melodies were typically written with no dynamics, phrasing marks or ornaments, as it was assumed that the performer would improvise these elements on the spot. In the Classical era, it became more common for composers to indicate where they wanted performers to play ornaments such as trills or turns. The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important, and also made the use of characteristic rhythms, such as attention-getting opening fanfares, the funeral march rhythm, or the minuet genre, more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement.\n\nThe Classical period also saw the gradual development of [[sonata form]], a set of structural principles for music that reconciled the Classical preference for melodic material with harmonic development, which could be applied across musical genres. The [[sonata]] itself continued to be the principal form for solo and chamber music, while later in the Classical period the [[string quartet]] became a prominent genre. The [[symphony]] form for orchestra was created in this period (this is popularly attributed to [[Joseph Haydn]]). The ''concerto grosso'' (a concerto for more than one musician), a very popular form in the Baroque era, began to be replaced by the ''solo concerto'', featuring only one soloist. Composers began to place more importance on the particular soloist's ability to show off virtuoso skills, with challenging, fast scale and arpeggio runs. Nonetheless, some ''concerti grossi'' remained, the most famous of which being Mozart's [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola in E flat Major]].\n\n[[File:Tokyo String Quartet.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern string quartet. In the 2000s, [[string quartet]]s from the Classical era are the core of the chamber music literature. From left to right: violin 1, violin 2, cello, viola]]\n\n== Main characteristics ==\nIn the classical period, the [[subject (music)|theme]] is made up of [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]]s with contrasting melodic figures and [[rhythm]]s. These phrases are relatively brief, typically four bars in length, and can occasionally seem sparse or terse.  The texture is mainly [[homophonic]],<ref name=Blume /> with a clear melody above a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]], for instance an [[Alberti bass]]. This contrasts with the practice in [[Baroque music]], where a piece or movement would typically have only one musical subject, which would then be worked out in a number of voices according to the principles of [[counterpoint]], while maintaining a consistent rhythm or metre throughout.  As a result, Classical music tends to have a lighter, clearer texture than the Baroque. The classical style draws on the ''[[Galant music|style galant]]'', a musical style which emphasised light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur.\n\nStructurally, Classical music generally has a clear [[musical form]], with a well-defined contrast between [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[dominant (music)|dominant]], introduced by clear [[Cadence (music)|cadences]]. [[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are used to highlight the structural characteristics of the piece. In particular, [[sonata form]] and its variants were developed during the early classical period and was frequently used.  The Classical approach to structure again contrasts with the Baroque, where a composition would normally move between tonic and dominant and back again, but through a continual progress of chord changes and without a sense of \"arrival\" at the new key. While counterpoint was less emphasised in the classical period, it was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period, and composers still used counterpoint in \"serious\" works such as symphonies and string quartets, as well as religious pieces, such as Masses.\n\nThe classical musical style was supported by technical developments in instruments. The widespread adoption of [[equal temperament]] made classical musical structure possible, by ensuring that cadences in all keys sounded similar. The [[fortepiano]] and then the [[pianoforte]] replaced the [[harpsichord]], enabling more dynamic contrast and more sustained melodies.  Over the Classical period, keyboard instruments became richer, more sonorous and more powerful.\n\nThe orchestra increased in size and range, and became more standardised. The [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] [[basso continuo]] role in orchestra  fell out of use between 1750 and 1775, leaving the string section [[woodwind]]s became a self-contained section, consisting of [[clarinet]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s and [[bassoon]]s.\n\nWhile vocal music such as [[comic opera]] was popular, great importance was given to instrumental music. The main kinds of instrumental music were the  [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]], [[concerto]] (usually for a virtuoso solo instrument accompanied by orchestra), and light pieces such as [[serenade]]s and [[divertimento]]s. [[Sonata form]] developed and became the most important form. It was used to build up the first movement of most large-scale works in [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[string quartet]]s. Sonata form was also used in other movements and in single, standalone pieces such as [[overture]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730\u20131760 ===\n{{See also|History of sonata form}}\n[[File:Joseph Siffred Duplessis - Christoph Willibald Gluck - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Gluck, detail of a portrait by [[Joseph Duplessis]], dated 1775 ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna)]]\n\nIn his book ''[[The Classical Style]]'', author and pianist [[Charles Rosen]] claims that from 1755 to 1775, composers groped for a new style that was more effectively dramatic. In the Baroque, dramatic expression was limited to the representation of individual sentiments (what Rosen terms \"dramatic sentiment\"). For example, in Handel's oratorio ''[[Jephtha (Handel)|Jephtha]]'', the composer renders four different emotions, one for each character, in the quartet \"O, spare your daughter\". Eventually this depiction of individual emotions came to be seen as simplistic and unrealistic; composers sought to portray multiple emotions, simultaneously or progressively, within a single character or movement (\"dramatic action\"). Thus in the finale of act 2 of Mozart's ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'', the lovers move \"from joy through suspicion and outrage to final reconciliation.\"<ref name=Rosen>[[Charles Rosen|Rosen, Charles]]. ''[[The Classical Style]],'' pp. 43\u201344. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1998</ref> \n\nMusically speaking, this \"dramatic action\" required more musical variety. Where Baroque music was characterized by seamless flow within individual movements and largely uniform textures, composers after the Baroque sought to interrupt this flow with changes in texture, dynamic, harmony, or tempo. Among the stylistic developments which followed the Baroque, the most dramatic came to be called ''Empfindsamkeit'', (roughly \"[[sensitive style]]\"), and its most well-known practitioner was [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]]. Composers of this style employed the above-discussed interruptions in the most abrupt manner, and the music can sound illogical at times. The Italian composer [[Domenico Scarlatti]] took these developments further. His more than five hundred single-movement keyboard sonatas also contain abrupt changes of texture, but these changes are organized into periods, balanced phrases that became a hallmark of the classical style. However, Scarlatti's changes in texture still sound sudden and unprepared. The outstanding achievement of the great classical composers (Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven) was their ability to make these dramatic surprises sound logically motivated, so that \"the expressive and the elegant could join hands.\"<ref name=Rosen></ref>\n\nAt first the new style took over Baroque forms\u2014the ternary ''[[da capo aria]]'' and the ''[[sinfonia]]'' and ''[[concerto]]''\u2014but composed with simpler parts, more notated ornamentation, rather than the improvised ornaments that were common in the Baroque era, and more emphatic division of pieces into sections. However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together, and the basic formal layouts changed. Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. One of the big textural changes was a shift away from the complex, dense [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style of the Baroque, in which multiple interweaving melodic lines were played simultaneously, and towards [[homophony]], a lighter texture which uses a clear single melody line accompanied by chords.\n\nBaroque music generally uses many harmonic fantasies and polyphonic sections that focus less on the structure of the musical piece, and there was less emphasis on clear musical phrases. In the classical period, the harmonies became simpler. However, the structure of the piece, the phrases and small melodic or rhythmic motives, became much more important than in the Baroque period.\n[[File:Muzio Clementi - sonata in g minor no.3, op 50, 'didone abbandonata' - ii. adagio dolente.ogg|thumb|left|200px|[[Muzio Clementi]]'s Sonata in G minor, No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;50, \"Didone abbandonata\", adagio movement]]\nAnother important break with the past was the radical overhaul of [[opera]] by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisational ornaments and focused on the points of [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] and transition. By making these moments where the harmony changes more of a focus, he enabled powerful dramatic shifts in the emotional color of the music. To highlight these transitions, he used changes in instrumentation ([[orchestration]]), melody, and [[Musical mode|mode]]. Among the most successful composers of his time, Gluck spawned many emulators, one of whom was [[Antonio Salieri]]. Their emphasis on accessibility brought huge successes in opera, and in other vocal music such as songs, oratorios, and choruses. These were considered the most important kinds of music for performance and hence enjoyed greatest public success.\n\nThe phase between the Baroque and the rise of the Classical (around 1730), was home to various competing musical styles. The diversity of artistic paths are represented in the sons of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]: [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]], who continued the Baroque tradition in a personal way; [[Johann Christian Bach]], who simplified textures of the Baroque and most clearly influenced Mozart; and [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]], who composed passionate and sometimes violently eccentric music of the ''Empfindsamkeit'' movement. Musical culture was caught at a crossroads: the masters of the older style had the technique, but the public hungered for the new. This is one of the reasons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]] was held in such high regard: he understood the older forms quite well and knew how to present them in new garb, with an enhanced variety of form.\n\n=== 1750\u20131775 ===\n{{See also|Symphony}}\n[[File:Haydn portrait by Thomas Hardy (small).jpg|thumb|left|Haydn portrait by [[Thomas Hardy (English painter)|Thomas Hardy]], 1792]]\n\nBy the late 1750s there were flourishing centers of the new style in Italy, Vienna, Mannheim, and Paris; dozens of symphonies were composed and there were bands of players associated with musical theatres. Opera or other vocal music accompanied by orchestra was the feature of most musical events, with concertos and symphonies (arising from the [[overture]]) serving as instrumental interludes and introductions for operas and church services. Over the course of the Classical period, symphonies and concertos developed and were presented independently of vocal music.\n[[File:Divertimento in E-flat major - KV 113 - 2nd movement.oga|thumb|right|200px|Mozart wrote a number of divertimentos, light instrumental pieces designed for entertainment. This is the 2nd movement of his Divertimento in E-flat major, K. 113.]]\nThe \"normal\" orchestra ensemble\u2014a body of [[String section|strings]] supplemented by winds\u2014and movements of particular rhythmic character were established by the late 1750s in Vienna. However, the length and weight of pieces was still set with some Baroque characteristics: individual movements still focused on one \"affect\" (musical mood) or had only one sharply contrasting middle section, and their length was not significantly greater than Baroque movements. There was not yet a clearly enunciated theory of how to compose in the new style. It was a moment ripe for a breakthrough. \n\nThe first great master of the style was the composer [[Joseph Haydn]]. In the late 1750s he began composing symphonies, and by 1761 he had composed a triptych (''Morning'', ''Noon'', and ''Evening'') solidly in the contemporary mode. As a vice-[[Kapellmeister]] and later Kapellmeister, his output expanded: he composed over forty symphonies in the 1760s alone. And while his fame grew, as his orchestra was expanded and his compositions were copied and disseminated, his voice was only one among many.\n\nWhile some scholars suggest that Haydn was overshadowed by Mozart and Beethoven, it would be difficult to overstate Haydn's centrality to the new style, and therefore to the future of Western art music as a whole. At the time, before the pre-eminence of Mozart or Beethoven, and with Johann Sebastian Bach known primarily to connoisseurs of keyboard music, Haydn reached a place in music that set him above all other composers except perhaps the Baroque era's [[George Frideric Handel]]. Haydn took existing ideas, and radically altered how they functioned\u2014earning him the titles \"father of the [[symphony]]\" and \"father of the [[string quartet]]\".\n\nOne of the forces that worked as an impetus for his pressing forward was the first stirring of what would later be called [[Romanticism]]\u2014the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'', or \"storm and stress\" phase in the arts, a short period where obvious and dramatic emotionalism was a stylistic preference. Haydn accordingly wanted more dramatic contrast and more emotionally appealing melodies, with sharpened character and individuality in his pieces. This period faded away in music and literature: however, it influenced what came afterward and would eventually be a component of aesthetic taste in later decades.\n\nThe ''[[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|Farewell Symphony]]'', No. 45 in F{{music|sharp}} Minor, exemplifies Haydn's integration of the differing demands of the new style, with surprising sharp turns and a long slow adagio to end the work. In 1772, Haydn completed his Opus 20 set of six string quartets, in which he deployed the polyphonic techniques he had gathered from the previous Baroque era to provide structural coherence capable of holding together his melodic ideas. For some, this marks the beginning of the \"mature\" Classical style, in which the period of reaction against late Baroque complexity yielded to a period of integration Baroque and Classical elements.\n\n=== 1775\u20131790 ===\n{{See also|Musical development}}\n[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|upright|thumb|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, posthumous painting by Barbara Krafft in 1819]]\n\nHaydn, having worked for over a decade as the music director for a prince, had far more resources and scope for composing than most other composers. His position also gave him the ability to shape the forces that would play his music, as he could select skilled musicians. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building and developing ideas in his music. His next important breakthrough was in the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Opus 33 string quartets]] (1781), in which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.\n[[File:Don Giovanni Commendatore.png|thumb|left|400px|The opening bars of the Commendatore's aria in Mozart's opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The orchestra starts with a dissonant [[diminished seventh]] chord (G# dim7 with a B in the bass) moving to a [[dominant seventh chord]] (A7 with a C# in the bass) before resolving to the [[tonic chord]] (D minor) at the singer's entrance.]]\nHaydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was at the same time in accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities, playing for the general public. This meant he needed to write operas and write and perform virtuoso pieces. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted to achieve both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of [[J.S. Bach]], the means to discipline and enrich his artistic gifts.\n[[File:Wolfgang01.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Mozart family c. 1780. The portrait on the wall is of Mozart's mother.]]\nMozart rapidly came to the attention of Haydn, who hailed the new composer, studied his works, and considered the younger man his only true peer in music. In Mozart, Haydn found a greater range of instrumentation, dramatic effect and melodic resource. The learning relationship moved in both directions. Mozart also had a great respect for the older, more experienced composer, and sought to learn from him.\n\nMozart's arrival in Vienna in 1780 brought an acceleration in the development of the Classical style. There, Mozart absorbed the fusion of Italianate brilliance and Germanic cohesiveness that had been brewing for the previous 20 years. His own taste for flashy brilliances, rhythmically complex melodies and figures, long cantilena melodies, and virtuoso flourishes was merged with an appreciation for formal coherence and internal connectedness. It is at this point that war and economic inflation halted a trend to larger orchestras and forced the disbanding or reduction of many theater orchestras. This pressed the Classical style inwards: toward seeking greater ensemble and technical challenges\u2014for example, scattering the melody across woodwinds, or using a melody harmonized in thirds. This process placed a premium on small ensemble music, called chamber music. It also led to a trend for more public performance, giving a further boost to the string quartet and other small ensemble groupings.\n\nIt was during this decade that public taste began, increasingly, to recognize that Haydn and Mozart had reached a high standard of composition. By the time Mozart arrived at age 25, in 1781, the dominant styles of Vienna were recognizably connected to the emergence in the 1750s of the early Classical style. By the end of the 1780s, changes in [[performance practice]], the relative standing of instrumental and vocal music, technical demands on musicians, and stylistic unity had become established in the composers who imitated Mozart and Haydn. During this decade Mozart composed his most famous operas, his six late symphonies that helped to redefine the genre, and a string of piano concerti that still stand at the pinnacle of these forms.\n\nOne composer who was influential in spreading the more serious style that Mozart and Haydn had formed is [[Muzio Clementi]], a gifted virtuoso pianist who tied with Mozart in a musical \"duel\" before the emperor in which they each improvised on the piano and performed their compositions. Clementi's sonatas for the piano circulated widely, and he became the most successful composer in [[London]] during the 1780s. Also in London at this time was [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], who, like Clementi, encouraged piano makers to extend the range and other features of their instruments, and then fully exploited the newly opened up possibilities. The importance of London in the Classical period is often overlooked, but it served as the home to the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood's]] factory for piano manufacturing and as the base for composers who, while less notable than the \"Vienna School\", had a decisive influence on what came later. They were composers of many fine works, notable in their own right. London's taste for virtuosity may well have encouraged the complex passage work and extended statements on tonic and dominant.\n\n=== Around 1790\u20131820 ===\nWhen Haydn and Mozart began composing, symphonies were played as single movements\u2014before, between, or as interludes within other works\u2014and many of them lasted only ten or twelve minutes; instrumental groups had varying standards of playing, and the continuo was a central part of music-making.\n\nIn the intervening years, the social world of music had seen dramatic changes. International publication and touring had grown explosively, and concert societies formed. Notation became more specific, more descriptive\u2014and schematics for works had been simplified (yet became more varied in their exact working out). In 1790, just before Mozart's death, with his reputation spreading rapidly, Haydn was poised for a series of successes, notably his late oratorios and \"London\" symphonies.<!-- Mozart's reputation or Haydn's?--> Composers in [[Paris]], [[Rome]], and all over Germany turned to Haydn and Mozart for their ideas on form.\n[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Beethoven by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]\n\nIn the 1790s, a new generation of composers, born around 1770, emerged. While they had grown up with the earlier styles, they heard in the recent works of Haydn and Mozart a vehicle for greater expression. In 1788 [[Luigi Cherubini]] settled in Paris and in 1791 composed ''Lodoiska'', an opera that raised him to fame. Its style is clearly reflective of the mature Haydn and Mozart, and its instrumentation gave it a weight that had not yet been felt in the [[grand opera]]. His contemporary [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]] extended instrumental effects with his 1790 opera ''Euphrosine et Coradin'', from which followed a series of successes. The final push towards change came from [[Gaspare Spontini]], who was deeply admired by future romantic composers such as Weber, Berlioz and Wagner. The innovative harmonic language of his operas, their refined instrumentation and their \"enchained\" closed numbers (a structural pattern which was later adopted by Weber in Euryanthe and from him handed down, through Marschner, to Wagner), formed the basis from which French and German romantic opera had its beginnings. \n[[File:Johann-nepomuk-hummel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hummel in 1814]]\nThe most fateful of the new generation was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who launched his numbered works in 1794 with a set of three piano trios, which remain in the repertoire. Somewhat younger than the others, though equally accomplished because of his youthful study under Mozart and his native virtuosity, was [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. Hummel studied under Haydn as well; he was a friend to Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]]. He concentrated more on the piano than any other instrument, and his time in London in 1791 and 1792 generated the composition and publication in 1793 of three piano sonatas, opus 2, which idiomatically used Mozart's techniques of avoiding the expected cadence, and Clementi's sometimes modally uncertain virtuoso figuration. Taken together, these composers can be seen as the vanguard of a broad change in style and the center of music. They studied one another's works, copied one another's gestures in music, and on occasion behaved like quarrelsome rivals.\n\nThe crucial differences with the previous wave can be seen in the downward shift in melodies, increasing durations of movements, the acceptance of Mozart and Haydn as paradigmatic, the greater use of keyboard resources, the shift from \"vocal\" writing to \"pianistic\" writing, the growing pull of the minor and of modal ambiguity, and the increasing importance of varying accompanying figures to bring \"texture\" forward as an element in music. In short, the late Classical was seeking music that was internally more complex. The growth of concert societies and amateur orchestras, marking the importance of music as part of middle-class life, contributed to a booming market for pianos, piano music, and virtuosi to serve as exemplars. Hummel, Beethoven, and Clementi were all renowned for their improvising.\n\n<!-- provide reference...One explanation for the shift in style has been advanced by [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and others:{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} the increasing centrality of the idea of [[theme and variations]] in compositional thinking. Schoenberg argues that the Classical style was one of \"continuing variation\", where development was, in effect, a theme and variations with greater continuity. In any event, theme and variations replaced the [[fugue]] as the standard vehicle for improvising and was often included, directly or indirectly, as a movement in longer instrumental works. -->\nThe direct influence of the Baroque continued to fade: the [[figured bass]] grew less prominent as a means of holding performance together, the performance practices of the mid-18th century continued to die out. However, at the same time, complete editions of Baroque masters began to become available, and the influence of Baroque style continued to grow, particularly in the ever more expansive use of brass. Another feature of the period is the growing number of performances where the composer was not present. This led to increased detail and specificity in notation; for example, there were fewer \"optional\" parts that stood separately from the main score.\n\nThe force of these shifts became apparent with Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, given the name ''Eroica'', which is Italian for \"heroic\", by the composer. As with Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', it may not have been the first in all of its innovations, but its aggressive use of every part of the Classical style set it apart from its contemporary works: in length, ambition, and harmonic resources as well.\n\n==First Viennese School==\n[[File:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Vienna in 1758, by [[Bernardo Bellotto]]]]\nThe [[First Viennese School]] is a name mostly used to refer to three composers of the Classical period in late-18th-century [[Vienna]]: Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. [[Franz Schubert]] is occasionally added to the list.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, the term ''Wiener Klassik'' (lit. ''Viennese classical era/art'') is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as ''classical'', namely [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Romantic music]].\n\nThe term \"Viennese School\" was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit, and eventually Beethoven was added to the list.<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Classical|author1=Heartz, Daniel|authorlink1=Daniel Heartz|author2=Bruce Alan Brown|author2-link=Bruce Alan Brown|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=27 December 2006}}</ref> The designation \"first\" is added today to avoid confusion with the [[Second Viennese School]].\n\nWhilst, Schubert apart, these composers certainly knew each other (with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners), there is no sense in which they were engaged in a collaborative effort in the sense that one would associate with 20th-century schools such as the Second Viennese School, or [[Les Six]]. Nor is there any significant sense in which one composer was \"schooled\" by another (in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg), though it is true that Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn.\n\nAttempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology.\n\n== Classical influence on later composers ==\n{{See also|Tonality|Transition from Classical to Romantic music}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Franz Schubert by Wilhelm August Rieder 1875.jpg|upright|thumb|left|1875 oil painting of Franz Schubert by [[Wilhelm August Rieder]], after his own 1825 watercolor portrait]]\nMusical eras and their prevalent styles, forms and instruments seldom disappear at once; instead, features are replaced over time, until the old approach is simply felt as \"old-fashioned\". The Classical style did not \"die\" suddenly; rather, it gradually got phased out under the weight of changes. To give just one example, while it is generally stated that the Classical era stopped using the [[harpsichord]] in orchestras, this did not happen all of a sudden at the start of the Classical era in 1750. Rather, orchestras slowly stopped using the harpsichord to play [[basso continuo]] until the practice was discontinued by the end of the 1700s.\n[[File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Felix Mendelssohn|Portrait of Mendelssohn by the English [[miniaturist]] James Warren Childe (1778\u20131862), 1839]]\nOne crucial change was the shift towards harmonies centering on \"flatward\" keys: shifts in the [[subdominant]] direction {{clarify|date=October 2015}}. In the Classical style, major key was far more common than minor, chromaticism being moderated through the use of \"sharpward\" modulation (e.g., a piece in C major modulating to G major, D major, or A major, all of which are keys with more sharps). As well, sections in the minor mode were often used for contrast. Beginning with Mozart and Clementi, there began a creeping colonization of the subdominant region (the ii or IV chord, which in the key of C major would be the keys of d minor or F major). With Schubert, subdominant modulations flourished after being introduced in contexts in which earlier composers would have confined themselves to dominant shifts (modulations to the [[dominant chord]], e.g., in the key of C major, modulating to G major). This introduced darker colors to music, strengthened the minor mode, and made structure harder to maintain. Beethoven contributed to this by his increasing use of the [[Interval (music)|fourth]] as a consonance, and modal ambiguity\u2014for example, the opening of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 in D minor]].\n\n[[Franz Schubert]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], and [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] are among the most prominent in this generation of \"Proto-Romantics\", along with the young [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Their sense of form was strongly influenced by the Classical style. While they were not yet \"learned\" composers (imitating rules which were codified by others), they directly responded to works by Beethoven, Mozart, Clementi, and others, as they encountered them. The instrumental forces at their disposal in orchestras were also quite \"Classical\" in number and variety, permitting similarity with Classical works.\n\nHowever, the forces destined to end the hold of the Classical style gathered strength in the works of many of the above composers, particularly Beethoven. The most commonly cited one is harmonic innovation. Also important is the increasing focus on having a continuous and rhythmically uniform accompanying figuration: [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata]] was the model for hundreds of later pieces\u2014where the shifting movement of a rhythmic figure provides much of the drama and interest of the work, while a melody drifts above it. Greater knowledge of works, greater instrumental expertise, increasing variety of instruments, the growth of concert societies, and the unstoppable domination of the increasingly more powerful piano (which was given a bolder, louder tone by technological developments such as the use of steel strings, heavy cast-iron frames and sympathetically vibrating strings) all created a huge audience for sophisticated music. All of these trends contributed to the [[Transition from Classical to Romantic music|shift to the \"Romantic\" style]].\n\nDrawing the line between these two styles is very difficult: some sections of Mozart's later works, taken alone, are indistinguishable in harmony and orchestration from music written 80 years later\u2014and some composers continued to write in normative Classical styles into the early 20th century. Even before Beethoven's death, composers such as [[Louis Spohr]] were self-described Romantics, incorporating, for example, more extravagant [[chromaticism]] in their works (e.g., using chromatic harmonies in a piece's [[chord progression]]). Conversely, works such as [[Symphony No. 5 (Schubert)|Schubert's Symphony No. 5]], written during the chronological dawn of the [[Romantic period (music)|Romantic]] era, exhibit a deliberately anachronistic artistic paradigm, harking back to the compositional style of several decades before.\n\nHowever, Vienna's fall as the most important musical center for orchestral composition during the late 1820s, precipitated by the deaths of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], marked the Classical style's final eclipse\u2014and the end of its continuous organic development of one composer learning in close proximity to others. [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] visited Vienna when they were young, but they then moved on to other cities. Composers such as [[Carl Czerny]], while deeply influenced by Beethoven, also searched for new ideas and new forms to contain the larger world of musical expression and performance in which they lived.\n\nRenewed interest in the formal balance and restraint of 18th century classical music led in the early 20th century to the development of so-called [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassical]] style, which numbered [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] among its proponents, at least at certain times in their careers.\n\n==Classical period instruments==\n[[File:FortepianoByMcNultyAfterWalter1805.jpg|thumb|upright|Fortepiano by Paul McNulty after Walter & Sohn, c. 1805]]\n{{See also|List of period instruments}}\n\n===Guitar===\nThe Baroque guitar, with four or five sets of double strings or \"courses\" and elaborately decorated soundhole, was a very different instrument from the early [[classical guitar]] which more closely resembles the modern instrument with the standard six strings. Judging by the number of instructional manuals published for the instrument \u2013 over three hundred texts were published by over two hundred authors between 1760 and 1860 \u2013 the classical period marked a golden age for guitar.<ref>Stenstadvold, Erik.

In the Classical period, the [[string section]] of the orchestra was standardized as just four instruments:\n\n* [[Violin]] (in orchestras and chamber music, typically there are first violins and second violins, with the former playing the melody and/or a higher line and the latter playing either a countermelody, a harmony part, a part below the first violin line in pitch, or an accompaniment line)\n* [[Viola]] (the alto voice of the orchestral string section and string quartet; it often performs \"inner voices\", which are accompaniment lines which fill in the [[harmony]] of the piece)\n* [[Cello]] (the cello plays two roles in Classical era music; at times it is used to play the [[bassline]] of the piece, typically doubled by the [[double bass]]es [Note: When cellos and double basses read the same bassline, the basses play an octave below the cellos, because the bass is a transposing instrument]; and at other times it performs melodies and solos in the lower register)\n* [[Double bass]] (the bass typically performs the lowest pitches in the string section in order to provide the bassline for the piece)\n\nIn the Baroque era, the double bass players were not usually given a separate part; instead, they typically played the same [[basso continuo]] [[bassline]] that the cellos and other low-pitched instruments (e.g., [[theorbo]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]] wind instrument, [[viol]]s), albeit an octave below the cellos, because the double bass is a transposing instrument that sounds one octave lower than it is written. In the Classical era, some composers continued to write only one bass part for their symphony, labeled \"bassi\"; this bass part was played by cellists and double bassists. During the Classical era, some composers began to give the double basses their own part.\n\n===Woodwinds===\n* [[Basset clarinet]]\n* [[Basset horn]]\n* [[Clarinette d'amour]]\n* Classical [[clarinet]]\n* [[Chalumeau]]\n* Flute\n* Oboe\n* Bassoon\n\n===Percussion===\n* [[Timpani]]\n* \"[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish music]]\":\n**[[Bass drum]]\n**[[Cymbal]]s\n**[[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]\n\n===Keyboards===\n* [[Clavichord]]\n* [[Fortepiano]] (the forerunner to the modern piano)\n* [[Piano]]\n* [[Harpsichord]], the standard Baroque era [[basso continuo]] keyboard instrument, was used until the 1750s, after which time it was gradually phased out, and replaced with the [[fortepiano]] and then the [[piano]].

Classical music has a lighter, clearer texture than Baroque music and is less complex. It is mainly [[homophonic]], using a clear [[melody]] line over a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]],<ref name=Blume>[[Friedrich Blume|Blume, Friedrich]]. ''Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey''. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1970</ref> but [[counterpoint]] was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. It also makes use of ''[[Galant music|style galant]]'' which emphasized light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur. Variety and contrast within a piece became more pronounced than before and the [[orchestra]] increased in size, range, and power.\n\nThe [[harpsichord]] was replaced as the main keyboard instrument by the [[piano]] (or [[fortepiano]]). Unlike the harpsichord, which plucks strings with quills, pianos strike the strings with leather-covered hammers when the keys are pressed, which enables the performer to play louder or softer (hence the original name \"fortepiano,\" literally \"loud soft\") and play with more expression; in contrast, the force with which a performer plays the harpsichord keys does not change the sound. Instrumental music was considered important by Classical period composers. The main kinds of instrumental music were the [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]] (performed by an orchestra) and the solo [[concerto]], which featured a virtuoso solo performer playing a solo work for violin, piano, flute, or another instrument, accompanied by an orchestra. Vocal music, such as [[art song|songs for a singer and piano]] (notably the work of Schubert), [[Choir|choral works]], and [[opera]] (a staged dramatic work for singers and orchestra) were also important during this period.\n\nThe best-known composers from this period are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]]; other notable names include [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], [[Leopold Mozart]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] is regarded either as a Romantic composer or a Classical period composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic era. [[Franz Schubert]] is also a transitional figure, as were [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], [[Luigi Cherubini]], [[Gaspare Spontini]], [[Gioachino Rossini]],  [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of ''Viennese Classic'' or ''Classicism'' ({{lang-de|Wiener Klassik|link=no}}), since Gluck, Mozart, Haydn, Salieri, Schubert, and Beethoven all worked in [[Vienna]].\n\n== Classicism ==\n{{Classicism}}\nIn the middle of the 18th century, Europe began to move toward a new style in [[architecture]], literature, and the arts, generally known as [[Classicism]]. This style sought to emulate the ideals of [[Classical antiquity]], especially those of [[Classical Greece]].<ref name=\"Kamien\">[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]]. Music: An Appreciation. 6th. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.</ref> Classical music used formality and emphasis on order and hierarchy, and a \"clearer\", \"cleaner\" style that used clearer divisions between parts (notably a clear, single melody accompanied by chords), brighter contrasts and \"tone colors\" (achieved by the use of dynamic changes and [[modulation (music)|modulations]] to more keys). In contrast with the richly layered music of the Baroque era, Classical music moved towards simplicity rather than complexity. In addition, the typical size of orchestras began to increase,<ref name=\"Kamien\"/> giving orchestras a more powerful sound.\n\nThe remarkable development of ideas in \"[[natural philosophy]]\" had already established itself in the public consciousness. In particular, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[physics]] was taken as a paradigm: structures should be well-founded in [[axiom]]s and be both well-articulated and orderly. This taste for structural clarity began to affect music, which moved away from the layered [[polyphony]] of the Baroque period toward a style known as [[homophony]], in which the [[melody]] is played over a subordinate [[harmony]].<ref name=\"Kamien\"/> This move meant that [[Chord (music)|chords]] became a much more prevalent feature of music, even if they interrupted the melodic smoothness of a single part. As a result, the [[tonality|tonal]] structure of a piece of music became [[counterpoint|more audible]].\n\nThe new style was also encouraged by changes in the economic order and social structure. As the 18th century progressed, the nobility became the primary patrons of instrumental music, while public taste increasingly preferred lighter, funny [[comic opera]]s. This led to changes in the way music was performed, the most crucial of which was the move to standard instrumental groups and the reduction in the importance of the ''[[basso continuo|continuo]]''\u2014the rhythmic and harmonic groundwork of a piece of music, typically played by a keyboard ([[harpsichord]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]) and usually accompanied by a varied group of bass instruments, including [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[bass viol]], and [[theorbo]]. One way to trace the decline of the continuo and its [[figured bass|figured]] chords is to examine the disappearance of the term ''[[obbligato]]'', meaning a mandatory instrumental part in a work of [[chamber music]]. In Baroque compositions, additional instruments could be added to the continuo group according to the group or leader's preference; in Classical compositions, all parts were specifically noted, though not always ''notated'', so the term \"obbligato\" became redundant. By 1800, basso continuo was practically extinct, except for the occasional use of a [[pipe organ]] continuo part in a religious [[Mass (music)|Mass]] in the early 1800s.\n\nEconomic changes also had the effect of altering the balance of availability and quality of musicians. While in the late Baroque, a major composer would have the entire musical resources of a town to draw on, the musical forces available at an aristocratic hunting lodge or small court were smaller and more fixed in their level of ability. This was a spur to having simpler parts for ensemble musicians to play, and in the case of a resident virtuoso group, a spur to writing spectacular, idiomatic parts for certain instruments, as in the case of the [[Mannheim orchestra]], or virtuoso solo parts for particularly skilled violinists or flautists. In addition, the appetite by audiences for a continual supply of new music carried over from the Baroque. This meant that works had to be performable with, at best, one or two rehearsals. Even after 1790 Mozart writes about \"the rehearsal\", with the implication that his concerts would have only one rehearsal.\n\nSince there was a greater emphasis on a single melodic line, there was greater emphasis on notating that line for [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and phrasing. This contrasts with the Baroque era, when melodies were typically written with no dynamics, phrasing marks or ornaments, as it was assumed that the performer would improvise these elements on the spot. In the Classical era, it became more common for composers to indicate where they wanted performers to play ornaments such as trills or turns. The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important, and also made the use of characteristic rhythms, such as attention-getting opening fanfares, the funeral march rhythm, or the minuet genre, more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement.\n\nThe Classical period also saw the gradual development of [[sonata form]], a set of structural principles for music that reconciled the Classical preference for melodic material with harmonic development, which could be applied across musical genres. The [[sonata]] itself continued to be the principal form for solo and chamber music, while later in the Classical period the [[string quartet]] became a prominent genre. The [[symphony]] form for orchestra was created in this period (this is popularly attributed to [[Joseph Haydn]]). The ''concerto grosso'' (a concerto for more than one musician), a very popular form in the Baroque era, began to be replaced by the ''solo concerto'', featuring only one soloist. Composers began to place more importance on the particular soloist's ability to show off virtuoso skills, with challenging, fast scale and arpeggio runs. Nonetheless, some ''concerti grossi'' remained, the most famous of which being Mozart's [[Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)|Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola in E flat Major]].\n\n[[File:Tokyo String Quartet.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A modern string quartet. In the 2000s, [[string quartet]]s from the Classical era are the core of the chamber music literature. From left to right: violin 1, violin 2, cello, viola]]\n\n== Main characteristics ==\nIn the classical period, the [[subject (music)|theme]] is made up of [[phrase (music theory)|phrase]]s with contrasting melodic figures and [[rhythm]]s. These phrases are relatively brief, typically four bars in length, and can occasionally seem sparse or terse.  The texture is mainly [[homophonic]],<ref name=Blume /> with a clear melody above a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]], for instance an [[Alberti bass]]. This contrasts with the practice in [[Baroque music]], where a piece or movement would typically have only one musical subject, which would then be worked out in a number of voices according to the principles of [[counterpoint]], while maintaining a consistent rhythm or metre throughout.  As a result, Classical music tends to have a lighter, clearer texture than the Baroque. The classical style draws on the ''[[Galant music|style galant]]'', a musical style which emphasised light elegance in place of the Baroque's dignified seriousness and impressive grandeur.\n\nStructurally, Classical music generally has a clear [[musical form]], with a well-defined contrast between [[tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[dominant (music)|dominant]], introduced by clear [[Cadence (music)|cadences]]. [[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are used to highlight the structural characteristics of the piece. In particular, [[sonata form]] and its variants were developed during the early classical period and was frequently used.  The Classical approach to structure again contrasts with the Baroque, where a composition would normally move between tonic and dominant and back again, but through a continual progress of chord changes and without a sense of \"arrival\" at the new key. While counterpoint was less emphasised in the classical period, it was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period, and composers still used counterpoint in \"serious\" works such as symphonies and string quartets, as well as religious pieces, such as Masses.\n\nThe classical musical style was supported by technical developments in instruments. The widespread adoption of [[equal temperament]] made classical musical structure possible, by ensuring that cadences in all keys sounded similar. The [[fortepiano]] and then the [[pianoforte]] replaced the [[harpsichord]], enabling more dynamic contrast and more sustained melodies.  Over the Classical period, keyboard instruments became richer, more sonorous and more powerful.\n\nThe orchestra increased in size and range, and became more standardised. The [[harpsichord]] or [[pipe organ]] [[basso continuo]] role in orchestra  fell out of use between 1750 and 1775, leaving the string section [[woodwind]]s became a self-contained section, consisting of [[clarinet]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[flute]]s and [[bassoon]]s.\n\nWhile vocal music such as [[comic opera]] was popular, great importance was given to instrumental music. The main kinds of instrumental music were the  [[sonata]], trio, [[string quartet]], [[symphony]], [[concerto]] (usually for a virtuoso solo instrument accompanied by orchestra), and light pieces such as [[serenade]]s and [[divertimento]]s. [[Sonata form]] developed and became the most important form. It was used to build up the first movement of most large-scale works in [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[string quartet]]s. Sonata form was also used in other movements and in single, standalone pieces such as [[overture]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Baroque/Classical transition c. 1730\u20131760 ===\n{{See also|History of sonata form}}\n[[File:Joseph Siffred Duplessis - Christoph Willibald Gluck - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Gluck, detail of a portrait by [[Joseph Duplessis]], dated 1775 ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna)]]\n\nIn his book ''[[The Classical Style]]'', author and pianist [[Charles Rosen]] claims that from 1755 to 1775, composers groped for a new style that was more effectively dramatic. In the Baroque, dramatic expression was limited to the representation of individual sentiments (what Rosen terms \"dramatic sentiment\"). For example, in Handel's oratorio ''[[Jephtha (Handel)|Jephtha]]'', the composer renders four different emotions, one for each character, in the quartet \"O, spare your daughter\". Eventually this depiction of individual emotions came to be seen as simplistic and unrealistic; composers sought to portray multiple emotions, simultaneously or progressively, within a single character or movement (\"dramatic action\"). Thus in the finale of act 2 of Mozart's ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'', the lovers move \"from joy through suspicion and outrage to final reconciliation.\"<ref name=Rosen>[[Charles Rosen|Rosen, Charles]]. ''[[The Classical Style]],'' pp. 43\u201344. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1998</ref> \n\nMusically speaking, this \"dramatic action\" required more musical variety. Where Baroque music was characterized by seamless flow within individual movements and largely uniform textures, composers after the Baroque sought to interrupt this flow with changes in texture, dynamic, harmony, or tempo. Among the stylistic developments which followed the Baroque, the most dramatic came to be called ''Empfindsamkeit'', (roughly \"[[sensitive style]]\"), and its most well-known practitioner was [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]]. Composers of this style employed the above-discussed interruptions in the most abrupt manner, and the music can sound illogical at times. The Italian composer [[Domenico Scarlatti]] took these developments further. His more than five hundred single-movement keyboard sonatas also contain abrupt changes of texture, but these changes are organized into periods, balanced phrases that became a hallmark of the classical style. However, Scarlatti's changes in texture still sound sudden and unprepared. The outstanding achievement of the great classical composers (Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven) was their ability to make these dramatic surprises sound logically motivated, so that \"the expressive and the elegant could join hands.\"<ref name=Rosen></ref>\n\nAt first the new style took over Baroque forms\u2014the ternary ''[[da capo aria]]'' and the ''[[sinfonia]]'' and ''[[concerto]]''\u2014but composed with simpler parts, more notated ornamentation, rather than the improvised ornaments that were common in the Baroque era, and more emphatic division of pieces into sections. However, over time, the new aesthetic caused radical changes in how pieces were put together, and the basic formal layouts changed. Composers from this period sought dramatic effects, striking melodies, and clearer textures. One of the big textural changes was a shift away from the complex, dense [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style of the Baroque, in which multiple interweaving melodic lines were played simultaneously, and towards [[homophony]], a lighter texture which uses a clear single melody line accompanied by chords.\n\nBaroque music generally uses many harmonic fantasies and polyphonic sections that focus less on the structure of the musical piece, and there was less emphasis on clear musical phrases. In the classical period, the harmonies became simpler. However, the structure of the piece, the phrases and small melodic or rhythmic motives, became much more important than in the Baroque period.\n[[File:Muzio Clementi - sonata in g minor no.3, op 50, 'didone abbandonata' - ii. adagio dolente.ogg|thumb|left|200px|[[Muzio Clementi]]'s Sonata in G minor, No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;50, \"Didone abbandonata\", adagio movement]]\nAnother important break with the past was the radical overhaul of [[opera]] by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], who cut away a great deal of the layering and improvisational ornaments and focused on the points of [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] and transition. By making these moments where the harmony changes more of a focus, he enabled powerful dramatic shifts in the emotional color of the music. To highlight these transitions, he used changes in instrumentation ([[orchestration]]), melody, and [[Musical mode|mode]]. Among the most successful composers of his time, Gluck spawned many emulators, one of whom was [[Antonio Salieri]]. Their emphasis on accessibility brought huge successes in opera, and in other vocal music such as songs, oratorios, and choruses. These were considered the most important kinds of music for performance and hence enjoyed greatest public success.\n\nThe phase between the Baroque and the rise of the Classical (around 1730), was home to various competing musical styles. The diversity of artistic paths are represented in the sons of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]: [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach]], who continued the Baroque tradition in a personal way; [[Johann Christian Bach]], who simplified textures of the Baroque and most clearly influenced Mozart; and [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]], who composed passionate and sometimes violently eccentric music of the ''Empfindsamkeit'' movement. Musical culture was caught at a crossroads: the masters of the older style had the technique, but the public hungered for the new. This is one of the reasons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C. P. E. Bach]] was held in such high regard: he understood the older forms quite well and knew how to present them in new garb, with an enhanced variety of form.\n\n=== 1750\u20131775 ===\n{{See also|Symphony}}\n[[File:Haydn portrait by Thomas Hardy (small).jpg|thumb|left|Haydn portrait by [[Thomas Hardy (English painter)|Thomas Hardy]], 1792]]\n\nBy the late 1750s there were flourishing centers of the new style in Italy, Vienna, Mannheim, and Paris; dozens of symphonies were composed and there were bands of players associated with musical theatres. Opera or other vocal music accompanied by orchestra was the feature of most musical events, with concertos and symphonies (arising from the [[overture]]) serving as instrumental interludes and introductions for operas and church services. Over the course of the Classical period, symphonies and concertos developed and were presented independently of vocal music.\n[[File:Divertimento in E-flat major - KV 113 - 2nd movement.oga|thumb|right|200px|Mozart wrote a number of divertimentos, light instrumental pieces designed for entertainment. This is the 2nd movement of his Divertimento in E-flat major, K. 113.]]\nThe \"normal\" orchestra ensemble\u2014a body of [[String section|strings]] supplemented by winds\u2014and movements of particular rhythmic character were established by the late 1750s in Vienna. However, the length and weight of pieces was still set with some Baroque characteristics: individual movements still focused on one \"affect\" (musical mood) or had only one sharply contrasting middle section, and their length was not significantly greater than Baroque movements. There was not yet a clearly enunciated theory of how to compose in the new style. It was a moment ripe for a breakthrough. \n\nThe first great master of the style was the composer [[Joseph Haydn]]. In the late 1750s he began composing symphonies, and by 1761 he had composed a triptych (''Morning'', ''Noon'', and ''Evening'') solidly in the contemporary mode. As a vice-[[Kapellmeister]] and later Kapellmeister, his output expanded: he composed over forty symphonies in the 1760s alone. And while his fame grew, as his orchestra was expanded and his compositions were copied and disseminated, his voice was only one among many.\n\nWhile some scholars suggest that Haydn was overshadowed by Mozart and Beethoven, it would be difficult to overstate Haydn's centrality to the new style, and therefore to the future of Western art music as a whole. At the time, before the pre-eminence of Mozart or Beethoven, and with Johann Sebastian Bach known primarily to connoisseurs of keyboard music, Haydn reached a place in music that set him above all other composers except perhaps the Baroque era's [[George Frideric Handel]]. Haydn took existing ideas, and radically altered how they functioned\u2014earning him the titles \"father of the [[symphony]]\" and \"father of the [[string quartet]]\".\n\nOne of the forces that worked as an impetus for his pressing forward was the first stirring of what would later be called [[Romanticism]]\u2014the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'', or \"storm and stress\" phase in the arts, a short period where obvious and dramatic emotionalism was a stylistic preference. Haydn accordingly wanted more dramatic contrast and more emotionally appealing melodies, with sharpened character and individuality in his pieces. This period faded away in music and literature: however, it influenced what came afterward and would eventually be a component of aesthetic taste in later decades.\n\nThe ''[[Symphony No. 45 (Haydn)|Farewell Symphony]]'', No. 45 in F{{music|sharp}} Minor, exemplifies Haydn's integration of the differing demands of the new style, with surprising sharp turns and a long slow adagio to end the work. In 1772, Haydn completed his Opus 20 set of six string quartets, in which he deployed the polyphonic techniques he had gathered from the previous Baroque era to provide structural coherence capable of holding together his melodic ideas. For some, this marks the beginning of the \"mature\" Classical style, in which the period of reaction against late Baroque complexity yielded to a period of integration Baroque and Classical elements.\n\n=== 1775\u20131790 ===\n{{See also|Musical development}}\n[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|upright|thumb|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, posthumous painting by Barbara Krafft in 1819]]\n\nHaydn, having worked for over a decade as the music director for a prince, had far more resources and scope for composing than most other composers. His position also gave him the ability to shape the forces that would play his music, as he could select skilled musicians. This opportunity was not wasted, as Haydn, beginning quite early on his career, sought to press forward the technique of building and developing ideas in his music. His next important breakthrough was in the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)|Opus 33 string quartets]] (1781), in which the melodic and the harmonic roles segue among the instruments: it is often momentarily unclear what is melody and what is harmony. This changes the way the ensemble works its way between dramatic moments of transition and climactic sections: the music flows smoothly and without obvious interruption. He then took this integrated style and began applying it to orchestral and vocal music.\n[[File:Don Giovanni Commendatore.png|thumb|left|400px|The opening bars of the Commendatore's aria in Mozart's opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The orchestra starts with a dissonant [[diminished seventh]] chord (G# dim7 with a B in the bass) moving to a [[dominant seventh chord]] (A7 with a C# in the bass) before resolving to the [[tonic chord]] (D minor) at the singer's entrance.]]\nHaydn's gift to music was a way of composing, a way of structuring works, which was at the same time in accord with the governing aesthetic of the new style. However, a younger contemporary, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], brought his genius to Haydn's ideas and applied them to two of the major genres of the day: opera, and the virtuoso concerto. Whereas Haydn spent much of his working life as a court composer, Mozart wanted public success in the concert life of cities, playing for the general public. This meant he needed to write operas and write and perform virtuoso pieces. Haydn was not a virtuoso at the international touring level; nor was he seeking to create operatic works that could play for many nights in front of a large audience. Mozart wanted to achieve both. Moreover, Mozart also had a taste for more chromatic chords (and greater contrasts in harmonic language generally), a greater love for creating a welter of melodies in a single work, and a more Italianate sensibility in music as a whole. He found, in Haydn's music and later in his study of the polyphony of [[J.S. Bach]], the means to discipline and enrich his artistic gifts.\n[[File:Wolfgang01.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Mozart family c. 1780. The portrait on the wall is of Mozart's mother.]]\nMozart rapidly came to the attention of Haydn, who hailed the new composer, studied his works, and considered the younger man his only true peer in music. In Mozart, Haydn found a greater range of instrumentation, dramatic effect and melodic resource. The learning relationship moved in both directions. Mozart also had a great respect for the older, more experienced composer, and sought to learn from him.\n\nMozart's arrival in Vienna in 1780 brought an acceleration in the development of the Classical style. There, Mozart absorbed the fusion of Italianate brilliance and Germanic cohesiveness that had been brewing for the previous 20 years. His own taste for flashy brilliances, rhythmically complex melodies and figures, long cantilena melodies, and virtuoso flourishes was merged with an appreciation for formal coherence and internal connectedness. It is at this point that war and economic inflation halted a trend to larger orchestras and forced the disbanding or reduction of many theater orchestras. This pressed the Classical style inwards: toward seeking greater ensemble and technical challenges\u2014for example, scattering the melody across woodwinds, or using a melody harmonized in thirds. This process placed a premium on small ensemble music, called chamber music. It also led to a trend for more public performance, giving a further boost to the string quartet and other small ensemble groupings.\n\nIt was during this decade that public taste began, increasingly, to recognize that Haydn and Mozart had reached a high standard of composition. By the time Mozart arrived at age 25, in 1781, the dominant styles of Vienna were recognizably connected to the emergence in the 1750s of the early Classical style. By the end of the 1780s, changes in [[performance practice]], the relative standing of instrumental and vocal music, technical demands on musicians, and stylistic unity had become established in the composers who imitated Mozart and Haydn. During this decade Mozart composed his most famous operas, his six late symphonies that helped to redefine the genre, and a string of piano concerti that still stand at the pinnacle of these forms.\n\nOne composer who was influential in spreading the more serious style that Mozart and Haydn had formed is [[Muzio Clementi]], a gifted virtuoso pianist who tied with Mozart in a musical \"duel\" before the emperor in which they each improvised on the piano and performed their compositions. Clementi's sonatas for the piano circulated widely, and he became the most successful composer in [[London]] during the 1780s. Also in London at this time was [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]], who, like Clementi, encouraged piano makers to extend the range and other features of their instruments, and then fully exploited the newly opened up possibilities. The importance of London in the Classical period is often overlooked, but it served as the home to the [[Broadwood and Sons|Broadwood's]] factory for piano manufacturing and as the base for composers who, while less notable than the \"Vienna School\", had a decisive influence on what came later. They were composers of many fine works, notable in their own right. London's taste for virtuosity may well have encouraged the complex passage work and extended statements on tonic and dominant.\n\n=== Around 1790\u20131820 ===\nWhen Haydn and Mozart began composing, symphonies were played as single movements\u2014before, between, or as interludes within other works\u2014and many of them lasted only ten or twelve minutes; instrumental groups had varying standards of playing, and the continuo was a central part of music-making.\n\nIn the intervening years, the social world of music had seen dramatic changes. International publication and touring had grown explosively, and concert societies formed. Notation became more specific, more descriptive\u2014and schematics for works had been simplified (yet became more varied in their exact working out). In 1790, just before Mozart's death, with his reputation spreading rapidly, Haydn was poised for a series of successes, notably his late oratorios and \"London\" symphonies.<!-- Mozart's reputation or Haydn's?--> Composers in [[Paris]], [[Rome]], and all over Germany turned to Haydn and Mozart for their ideas on form.\n[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Beethoven by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1820]]\n\nIn the 1790s, a new generation of composers, born around 1770, emerged. While they had grown up with the earlier styles, they heard in the recent works of Haydn and Mozart a vehicle for greater expression. In 1788 [[Luigi Cherubini]] settled in Paris and in 1791 composed ''Lodoiska'', an opera that raised him to fame. Its style is clearly reflective of the mature Haydn and Mozart, and its instrumentation gave it a weight that had not yet been felt in the [[grand opera]]. His contemporary [[\u00c9tienne M\u00e9hul]] extended instrumental effects with his 1790 opera ''Euphrosine et Coradin'', from which followed a series of successes. The final push towards change came from [[Gaspare Spontini]], who was deeply admired by future romantic composers such as Weber, Berlioz and Wagner. The innovative harmonic language of his operas, their refined instrumentation and their \"enchained\" closed numbers (a structural pattern which was later adopted by Weber in Euryanthe and from him handed down, through Marschner, to Wagner), formed the basis from which French and German romantic opera had its beginnings. \n[[File:Johann-nepomuk-hummel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hummel in 1814]]\nThe most fateful of the new generation was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who launched his numbered works in 1794 with a set of three piano trios, which remain in the repertoire. Somewhat younger than the others, though equally accomplished because of his youthful study under Mozart and his native virtuosity, was [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. Hummel studied under Haydn as well; he was a friend to Beethoven and [[Franz Schubert]]. He concentrated more on the piano than any other instrument, and his time in London in 1791 and 1792 generated the composition and publication in 1793 of three piano sonatas, opus 2, which idiomatically used Mozart's techniques of avoiding the expected cadence, and Clementi's sometimes modally uncertain virtuoso figuration. Taken together, these composers can be seen as the vanguard of a broad change in style and the center of music. They studied one another's works, copied one another's gestures in music, and on occasion behaved like quarrelsome rivals.\n\nThe crucial differences with the previous wave can be seen in the downward shift in melodies, increasing durations of movements, the acceptance of Mozart and Haydn as paradigmatic, the greater use of keyboard resources, the shift from \"vocal\" writing to \"pianistic\" writing, the growing pull of the minor and of modal ambiguity, and the increasing importance of varying accompanying figures to bring \"texture\" forward as an element in music. In short, the late Classical was seeking music that was internally more complex. The growth of concert societies and amateur orchestras, marking the importance of music as part of middle-class life, contributed to a booming market for pianos, piano music, and virtuosi to serve as exemplars. Hummel, Beethoven, and Clementi were all renowned for their improvising.\n\n<!-- provide reference...One explanation for the shift in style has been advanced by [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] and others:{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} the increasing centrality of the idea of [[theme and variations]] in compositional thinking. Schoenberg argues that the Classical style was one of \"continuing variation\", where development was, in effect, a theme and variations with greater continuity. In any event, theme and variations replaced the [[fugue]] as the standard vehicle for improvising and was often included, directly or indirectly, as a movement in longer instrumental works. -->\nThe direct influence of the Baroque continued to fade: the [[figured bass]] grew less prominent as a means of holding performance together, the performance practices of the mid-18th century continued to die out. However, at the same time, complete editions of Baroque masters began to become available, and the influence of Baroque style continued to grow, particularly in the ever more expansive use of brass. Another feature of the period is the growing number of performances where the composer was not present. This led to increased detail and specificity in notation; for example, there were fewer \"optional\" parts that stood separately from the main score.\n\nThe force of these shifts became apparent with Beethoven's 3rd Symphony, given the name ''Eroica'', which is Italian for \"heroic\", by the composer. As with Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', it may not have been the first in all of its innovations, but its aggressive use of every part of the Classical style set it apart from its contemporary works: in length, ambition, and harmonic resources as well.\n\n==First Viennese School==\n[[File:Canaletto (I) 058.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Vienna in 1758, by [[Bernardo Bellotto]]]]\nThe [[First Viennese School]] is a name mostly used to refer to three composers of the Classical period in late-18th-century [[Vienna]]: Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. [[Franz Schubert]] is occasionally added to the list.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, the term ''Wiener Klassik'' (lit. ''Viennese classical era/art'') is used. That term is often more broadly applied to the Classical era in music as a whole, as a means to distinguish it from other periods that are colloquially referred to as ''classical'', namely [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Romantic music]].\n\nThe term \"Viennese School\" was first used by Austrian musicologist Raphael Georg Kiesewetter in 1834, although he only counted Haydn and Mozart as members of the school. Other writers followed suit, and eventually Beethoven was added to the list.<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Classical|author1=Heartz, Daniel|authorlink1=Daniel Heartz|author2=Bruce Alan Brown|author2-link=Bruce Alan Brown|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=27 December 2006}}</ref> The designation \"first\" is added today to avoid confusion with the [[Second Viennese School]].\n\nWhilst, Schubert apart, these composers certainly knew each other (with Haydn and Mozart even being occasional chamber-music partners), there is no sense in which they were engaged in a collaborative effort in the sense that one would associate with 20th-century schools such as the Second Viennese School, or [[Les Six]]. Nor is there any significant sense in which one composer was \"schooled\" by another (in the way that Berg and Webern were taught by Schoenberg), though it is true that Beethoven for a time received lessons from Haydn.\n\nAttempts to extend the First Viennese School to include such later figures as [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] are merely journalistic, and never encountered in academic musicology.\n\n== Classical influence on later composers ==\n{{See also|Tonality|Transition from Classical to Romantic music}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n[[File:Franz Schubert by Wilhelm August Rieder 1875.jpg|upright|thumb|left|1875 oil painting of Franz Schubert by [[Wilhelm August Rieder]], after his own 1825 watercolor portrait]]\nMusical eras and their prevalent styles, forms and instruments seldom disappear at once; instead, features are replaced over time, until the old approach is simply felt as \"old-fashioned\". The Classical style did not \"die\" suddenly; rather, it gradually got phased out under the weight of changes. To give just one example, while it is generally stated that the Classical era stopped using the [[harpsichord]] in orchestras, this did not happen all of a sudden at the start of the Classical era in 1750. Rather, orchestras slowly stopped using the harpsichord to play [[basso continuo]] until the practice was discontinued by the end of the 1700s.\n[[File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Felix Mendelssohn|Portrait of Mendelssohn by the English [[miniaturist]] James Warren Childe (1778\u20131862), 1839]]\nOne crucial change was the shift towards harmonies centering on \"flatward\" keys: shifts in the [[subdominant]] direction {{clarify|date=October 2015}}. In the Classical style, major key was far more common than minor, chromaticism being moderated through the use of \"sharpward\" modulation (e.g., a piece in C major modulating to G major, D major, or A major, all of which are keys with more sharps). As well, sections in the minor mode were often used for contrast. Beginning with Mozart and Clementi, there began a creeping colonization of the subdominant region (the ii or IV chord, which in the key of C major would be the keys of d minor or F major). With Schubert, subdominant modulations flourished after being introduced in contexts in which earlier composers would have confined themselves to dominant shifts (modulations to the [[dominant chord]], e.g., in the key of C major, modulating to G major). This introduced darker colors to music, strengthened the minor mode, and made structure harder to maintain. Beethoven contributed to this by his increasing use of the [[Interval (music)|fourth]] as a consonance, and modal ambiguity\u2014for example, the opening of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 in D minor]].\n\n[[Franz Schubert]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], and [[John Field (composer)|John Field]] are among the most prominent in this generation of \"Proto-Romantics\", along with the young [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Their sense of form was strongly influenced by the Classical style. While they were not yet \"learned\" composers (imitating rules which were codified by others), they directly responded to works by Beethoven, Mozart, Clementi, and others, as they encountered them. The instrumental forces at their disposal in orchestras were also quite \"Classical\" in number and variety, permitting similarity with Classical works.\n\nHowever, the forces destined to end the hold of the Classical style gathered strength in the works of many of the above composers, particularly Beethoven. The most commonly cited one is harmonic innovation. Also important is the increasing focus on having a continuous and rhythmically uniform accompanying figuration: [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata]] was the model for hundreds of later pieces\u2014where the shifting movement of a rhythmic figure provides much of the drama and interest of the work, while a melody drifts above it. Greater knowledge of works, greater instrumental expertise, increasing variety of instruments, the growth of concert societies, and the unstoppable domination of the increasingly more powerful piano (which was given a bolder, louder tone by technological developments such as the use of steel strings, heavy cast-iron frames and sympathetically vibrating strings) all created a huge audience for sophisticated music. All of these trends contributed to the [[Transition from Classical to Romantic music|shift to the \"Romantic\" style]].\n\nDrawing the line between these two styles is very difficult: some sections of Mozart's later works, taken alone, are indistinguishable in harmony and orchestration from music written 80 years later\u2014and some composers continued to write in normative Classical styles into the early 20th century. Even before Beethoven's death, composers such as [[Louis Spohr]] were self-described Romantics, incorporating, for example, more extravagant [[chromaticism]] in their works (e.g., using chromatic harmonies in a piece's [[chord progression]]). Conversely, works such as [[Symphony No. 5 (Schubert)|Schubert's Symphony No. 5]], written during the chronological dawn of the [[Romantic period (music)|Romantic]] era, exhibit a deliberately anachronistic artistic paradigm, harking back to the compositional style of several decades before.\n\nHowever, Vienna's fall as the most important musical center for orchestral composition during the late 1820s, precipitated by the deaths of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], marked the Classical style's final eclipse\u2014and the end of its continuous organic development of one composer learning in close proximity to others. [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] visited Vienna when they were young, but they then moved on to other cities. Composers such as [[Carl Czerny]], while deeply influenced by Beethoven, also searched for new ideas and new forms to contain the larger world of musical expression and performance in which they lived.\n\nRenewed interest in the formal balance and restraint of 18th century classical music led in the early 20th century to the development of so-called [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassical]] style, which numbered [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] among its proponents, at least at certain times in their careers.\n\n==Classical period instruments==\n[[File:FortepianoByMcNultyAfterWalter1805.jpg|thumb|upright|Fortepiano by Paul McNulty after Walter & Sohn, c. 1805]]\n{{See also|List of period instruments}}\n\n===Guitar===\nThe Baroque guitar, with four or five sets of double strings or \"courses\" and elaborately decorated soundhole, was a very different instrument from the early [[classical guitar]] which more closely resembles the modern instrument with the standard six strings. Judging by the number of instructional manuals published for the instrument \u2013 over three hundred texts were published by over two hundred authors between 1760 and 1860 \u2013 the classical period marked a golden age for guitar.<ref>Stenstadvold, Erik.

In the Classical period, the [[string section]] of the orchestra was standardized as just four instruments:\n\n* [[Violin]] (in orchestras and chamber music, typically there are first violins and second violins, with the former playing the melody and/or a higher line and the latter playing either a countermelody, a harmony part, a part below the first violin line in pitch, or an accompaniment line)\n* [[Viola]] (the alto voice of the orchestral string section and string quartet; it often performs \"inner voices\", which are accompaniment lines which fill in the [[harmony]] of the piece)\n* [[Cello]] (the cello plays two roles in Classical era music; at times it is used to play the [[bassline]] of the piece, typically doubled by the [[double bass]]es [Note: When cellos and double basses read the same bassline, the basses play an octave below the cellos, because the bass is a transposing instrument]; and at other times it performs melodies and solos in the lower register)\n* [[Double bass]] (the bass typically performs the lowest pitches in the string section in order to provide the bassline for the piece)\n\nIn the Baroque era, the double bass players were not usually given a separate part; instead, they typically played the same [[basso continuo]] [[bassline]] that the cellos and other low-pitched instruments (e.g., [[theorbo]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]] wind instrument, [[viol]]s), albeit an octave below the cellos, because the double bass is a transposing instrument that sounds one octave lower than it is written. In the Classical era, some composers continued to write only one bass part for their symphony, labeled \"bassi\"; this bass part was played by cellists and double bassists. During the Classical era, some composers began to give the double basses their own part.\n\n===Woodwinds===\n* [[Basset clarinet]]\n* [[Basset horn]]\n* [[Clarinette d'amour]]\n* Classical [[clarinet]]\n* [[Chalumeau]]\n* Flute\n* Oboe\n* Bassoon\n\n===Percussion===\n* [[Timpani]]\n* \"[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish music]]\":\n**[[Bass drum]]\n**[[Cymbal]]s\n**[[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]\n\n===Keyboards===\n* [[Clavichord]]\n* [[Fortepiano]] (the forerunner to the modern piano)\n* [[Piano]]\n* [[Harpsichord]], the standard Baroque era [[basso continuo]] keyboard instrument, was used until the 1750s, after which time it was gradually phased out, and replaced with the [[fortepiano]] and then the [[piano]].
