It was initially produced in a lime-dominant colorway, consisting of large organic shapes in mid green and brown, black \u2018branches\u2019, and light green \u2018leaf highlights\u2019. Shortly thereafter a brown-dominant scheme (with the light green replaced by light tan) was manufactured. The two patterns are also unofficially known as \"Lowland\" and \"Highland\" ERDL, respectively.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071017140759/http://www.geocities.com/canuck_infantry/North_America.html  Mark's Asian Camo Uniforms<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n|direction=vertical\n|image2=DF-ST-90-04665.jpg\n|caption2=U.S. airmen in August 1988; the airman on the far left is wearing a BDU in the brown-dominant ERDL pattern.\n|image1=Robert Mueller receives award from Martin Sexton in South Vietnam in 1969.jpg\n|caption1=[[Robert Mueller]] wearing an ERDL-patterned uniform in 1969}}\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) adopted the green \"Lowland\" version as standard issue in South Vietnam from 1968, and later the U.S. Army introduced it on a wide scale in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe ERDL-pattern combat uniform was identical in cut to the [[OG-107]] jungle fatigues it was issued alongside.<ref>[http://david.brubakers.us/Vietnam/index.html Vietnam - Equipment and Uniform<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was common for Marines to wear mixes of ERDL and OG-107 jungle fatigues, which was authorized owing to periodic shortages. Australian and New Zealand SAS members were also issued U.S.-spec tropical combat uniforms in ERDL during their time in the Vietnam War. By the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. servicemen wore camouflage combat dress as the norm.<ref>{{cite book | last = Newark | first = Tim | title= Camouflage | year=2007 | publisher= Thames & Hudson | isbn = 978-0-500-51347-7}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the U.S. military from South Vietnam in 1973, the U.S. Army no longer routinely issued camouflage clothing. The 1st Battalion, [[13th Infantry Regiment (United States)|13th Infantry Regiment]] wore the ERDL-leaf pattern as an experiment in the early 1970s from January 1973 to 1974<ref>\"1st Bn 13th Inf Stands Out as Div Unit\", ''The Arrow'' (19 November 1973), p. VI</ref> in [[Baumholder]], Germany. Soldiers in the 1st and 2d Ranger Battalions (1/75 & 2/75 Ranger [Airborne]) received ERDL jungle fatigues of all three varieties as organizational issue, and during this same period U.S. Army Special Forces Groups, the U.S. Army Special Forces Center and School, the 82d Airborne Division and 36th Airborne Brigade (Texas National Guard) were issued the ERDL jungle fatigues until replaced by BDUs. 1st Battalion (mechanized), 41st Infantry, wore ERDL unfiforms in 1974 and 1975. This unit was the \"tip of the spear\" for the Second Armored Division with assignments at Ft. Hood, Texas and Hohenfels, West Germany. In 1976, the Marines obtained the leftover Vietnam War-era ERDL pattern uniforms which became general issue, replacing the solid OG-107 [[sateen]] utility/fatigue uniform. As there was never an ERDL pattern Marine-style utility cap, the Marines continued to wear the solid OG utility hat until the adoption of the BDU pattern. It was to be used to equip the United States Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) while on tropical missions. Photographs during the 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] show U.S. marines guarding the U.S. embassy wearing the RDF version ERDL uniforms when they were taken hostage by Iranian revolutionaries.\n\nIt was not until 1981 that the Army approved another camouflaged uniform. That year it officially introduced the M81 [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDU) in [[U.S. Woodland|Woodland]] pattern,<ref>{{cite book| title = Department of the Army Historical Summary FY 1981| chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1981/ch07.htm | chapter = Chapter 7: Support Services| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1981/index.htm#Contents| editor = Christine O. Hardyman| publisher = United States Army Center of Military History| year = 1988}}</ref> an enlarged and slightly altered version of ERDL, to supply all arms of the U.S. military. The last batches of the ERDL-patterned fatigues saw service into the 1980s, notably during [[Operation Eagle Claw]], peacekeeping operations in Beirut, and the [[invasion of Grenada]].\n\nSamples of the ERDL pattern acquired during the Vietnam War were shipped to the USSR, where it used as the basis for making the TTsKO camouflage pattern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Garment types, designs, and use in Southeast Asia (1967\u201372)===\nThe ERDL pattern was used on official and unofficial U.S. military garments in Southeast Asia (SEA), in both ground and aviation garment versions, from 1967 to the war's end. Early production on the ERDL ran into problems due to roller slippage, which results in inconsistencies with the patterns that were printed.{{sfn|Dougherty|2017|p=63}}\n\nOn official ground combat garments, the ERDL pattern was first applied to the third model Tropical Combat Uniform around 1967, and was printed onto a lightweight cotton poplin textile material. This poplin uniform was very short-lived, but it did see combat use in SEA by various U.S. special operations and some other units. Soon afterward, the ERDL pattern was printed onto the standard rip-stop cotton textile material. This ERDL rip-stop cotton Tropical Combat Uniform version thus saw wide use in SEA after 1968, with special operations units and also regular units, especially as ground combat operations continued throughout the war up to late 1972.\n\nOn official aviation combat garments, the ERDL pattern was used on the USAF Type K-2B flying coveralls, in a cotton poplin textile version. The USAF ERDL coveralls saw some use in SEA from 1967\u201369, until replaced by Nomex coveralls in 1970. The U.S. Navy also produced an official ERDL aviation garment in their MIL-C-5390G pattern, produced in a cotton twill textile. These Navy ERDL coveralls saw very limited SEA use from 1967\u201368, as their Nomex coveralls were already in use.\n\nOn unofficial and commercial garments, the ERDL pattern was copied and used by U.S. commercial textile manufacturers in the late 1960s, and applied to various commercial camouflage garments for hunting or unofficial military use. Some commercial ERDL garment examples were made using cotton poplin material, and others were made in the standard rip-stop cotton material. Many commercial ERDL garment examples of the time were made in the pattern mirroring the standard OG-107 fatigue uniforms, with a standard tucked-in shirt, and conventional trousers design. These commercial ERDL OG-107 fatigue-style garments did see some combat use in SEA, such as with U.S. Navy tactical jet aviators in the 1968 timeframe.

Australian and New Zealand SAS members were also issued U.S.-spec tropical combat uniforms in ERDL during their time in the Vietnam War. By the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. servicemen wore camouflage combat dress as the norm.<ref>{{cite book | last = Newark | first = Tim | title= Camouflage | year=2007 | publisher= Thames & Hudson | isbn = 978-0-500-51347-7}}</ref> \n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the U.S. military from South Vietnam in 1973, the U.S. Army no longer routinely issued camouflage clothing. The 1st Battalion, [[13th Infantry Regiment (United States)|13th Infantry Regiment]] wore the ERDL-leaf pattern as an experiment in the early 1970s from January 1973 to 1974<ref>\"1st Bn 13th Inf Stands Out as Div Unit\", ''The Arrow'' (19 November 1973), p. VI</ref> in [[Baumholder]], Germany. Soldiers in the 1st and 2d Ranger Battalions (1/75 & 2/75 Ranger [Airborne]) received ERDL jungle fatigues of all three varieties as organizational issue, and during this same period the 82d Airborne Division and 36th Airborne Brigade (Texas National Guard) were issued the ERDL jungle fatigues until replaced by BDUs. 1st Battalion (mechanized), 41st Infantry, wore ERDL unfiforms in 1974 and 1975. This unit was the \"tip of the spear\" for the Second Armored Division with assignments at Ft. Hood, Texas and Hohenfels, West Germany. In 1976, the Marines obtained the leftover Vietnam War-era ERDL pattern uniforms which became general issue, replacing the solid OG-107 [[sateen]] utility/fatigue uniform. As there was never an ERDL pattern Marine-style utility cap, the Marines continued to wear the solid OG utility hat until the adoption of the BDU pattern. It was to be used to equip the United States Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) while on tropical missions. Photographs during the 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] show U.S. marines guarding the U.S. embassy wearing the RDF version ERDL uniforms when they were taken hostage by Iranian revolutionaries.\n\nIt was not until 1981 that the Army approved another camouflaged uniform. That year it officially introduced the M81 [[Battle Dress Uniform]] (BDU) in [[U.S. Woodland|Woodland]] pattern,<ref>{{cite book| title = Department of the Army Historical Summary FY 1981| chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1981/ch07.htm | chapter = Chapter 7: Support Services| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1981/index.htm#Contents| editor = Christine O.

The last batches of the ERDL-patterned fatigues saw service into the 1980s, notably during [[Operation Eagle Claw]], peacekeeping operations in Beirut, and the [[invasion of Grenada]].\n\nSamples of the ERDL pattern acquired during the Vietnam War were shipped to the USSR, where it used as the basis for making the TTsKO camouflage pattern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Garment types, designs, and use in Southeast Asia (1967\u201372)===\nThe ERDL pattern was used on official and unofficial U.S. military garments in Southeast Asia (SEA), in both ground and aviation garment versions, from 1967 to the war's end. Early production on the ERDL ran into problems due to roller slippage, which results in inconsistencies with the patterns that were printed.{{sfn|Dougherty|2017|p=63}}\n\nOn official ground combat garments, the ERDL pattern was first applied to the third model Tropical Combat Uniform around 1967, and was printed onto a lightweight cotton poplin textile material. This poplin uniform was very short-lived, but it did see combat use in SEA by various U.S. special operations and some other units. Soon afterward, the ERDL pattern was printed onto the standard rip-stop cotton textile material. This ERDL rip-stop cotton Tropical Combat Uniform version thus saw wide use in SEA after 1968, with special operations units and also regular units, especially as ground combat operations continued throughout the war up to late 1972.\n\nOn official aviation combat garments, the ERDL pattern was used on the USAF Type K-2B flying coveralls, in a cotton poplin textile version. The USAF ERDL coveralls saw some use in SEA from 1967\u201369, until replaced by Nomex coveralls in 1970. The U.S. Navy also produced an official ERDL aviation garment in their MIL-C-5390G pattern, produced in a cotton twill textile. These Navy ERDL coveralls saw very limited SEA use from 1967\u201368, as their Nomex coveralls were already in use.\n\nOn unofficial and commercial garments, the ERDL pattern was copied and used by U.S. commercial textile manufacturers in the late 1960s, and applied to various commercial camouflage garments for hunting or unofficial military use. Some commercial ERDL garment examples were made using cotton poplin material, and others were made in the standard rip-stop cotton material. Many commercial ERDL garment examples of the time were made in the pattern mirroring the standard OG-107 fatigue uniforms, with a standard tucked-in shirt, and conventional trousers design. These commercial ERDL OG-107 fatigue-style garments did see some combat use in SEA, such as with U.S. Navy tactical jet aviators in the 1968 timeframe. Some USAF aviators also purchased locally tailor-made ERDL garments for combat and off-duty use. Additionally, some tropical combat uniforms were made by local tailors in the ERDL rip-stop material, which were particularly useful when a classified mission required the use of 'sanitized' or 'sterile' apparel, and equipment.\n\n==Users==\n<!--Please do not add anything here without a reliable source, as it will be removed.-->\n\n===Current===\n* {{Flag|Czech Republic}}: The [[Military of the Czech Republic|Czech Armed Forces]] use a modified version of the ERDL pattern, known as Woodland pattern vz.95.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20200327072705/https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1059969.pdf</ref><Ref>https://www.joint-forces.com/features/kit-camo/31575-czech-vz95-leaf-pattern-43rd-airborne-battalion</ref>\n* {{Flag|Syria}}: Clones made for the Syrian military.<ref>http://armamentresearch.com/a-snapshot-of-camouflage-patterns-in-syria/</ref>\n\n===Former===\n* {{flag|Australia}}: Formerly used by [[Australian Special Air Service|Australian SAS]] in the Vietnam War.<ref>https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C993358</ref>\n* {{flag|Philippines}}: Formerly used by the Special Action Force in the 1980s.{{sfn|Conboy|1991|p=61}} Also used by the Home Front Defense Group and the Scout Ranger Regiment.{{sfn|Conboy|1991|p=61}}\n* {{flag|New Zealand}}: Formerly used by [[New Zealand Special Air Service|New Zealand SAS]] during (and after) the Vietnam War<ref>'Training in the jungle', URL: https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/photo/camoflage-action, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 25-Oct-2013</ref><ref>'Helen Kesha welcomes troops -
