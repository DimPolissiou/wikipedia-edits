Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's [[Edwin Cannan]] (1861\u20131935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, [[Alfred Marshall]] (1842\u20131924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)<ref>Dahrendorf (1995), p.210-213</ref>\n\nThe dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser.<ref>Gerard Loot, cited in Dahrendorf (1995), P.212</ref> Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/41/1/307/2625390/The-London-and-Cambridge-Economic-Service-history?redirectedFrom=fulltext|title=The London and Cambridge Economic Service: history and contributions|author=Robert A.

The LSE Economist [[Lionel Robbins]] was also heavily involved. Starting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as [[Keynesian economics]], involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the [[Austrian School]], which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.<ref name=CambDebate/>\n\nDuring World War II, the School decamped from London to the [[University of Cambridge]], occupying buildings belonging to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album/hostel/hostel_03.jpg |title=Peterhouse Images |publisher=Peterhouse, Cambridge |accessdate=23 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001601/http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album%2Fhostel%2Fhostel_03.jpg |archivedate=29 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe School's arms,<ref name=\"PlantArms\">{{cite web|first = Arnold|last = Plant|authorlink = Arnold Plant|title = File:\"Coat of arms of the London School of Economics and Political Science\"|url = http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/1-6%20original.jpg|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100531073327/http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/1-6%20original.jpg|url-status = dead|archive-date = 31 May 2010|publisher = Institute of Education|accessdate = 23 July 2009}}</ref> including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922,<ref name=\"IOEBeginnings\">{{cite web|title=London School of Economics |url=http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begslse.html |work=Beginnings: The History of Higher Education in Bloomsbury and Westminster |publisher=Institute of Education |accessdate=23 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926011322/http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begslse.html |archivedate=26 September 2009 }}</ref> on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter.<ref name=\"LSEBeaverClub\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908033808/http://www.alumni.lse.ac.uk/olc/pub/LHE/filemanager/annualfund/giftclubs/beaversclub/default.htm|archive-date=8 September 2009|title = London School of Economics Online Community \u2013 Member Services|url = http://www.alumni.lse.ac.uk/olc/pub/LHE/filemanager/annualfund/giftclubs/beaversclub/default.htm|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate =23 July 2009}}</ref> The Latin motto, {{Lang|la|rerum cognoscere causas}}, is taken from [[Virgil]]'s [[Georgics]].

Rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's [[Edwin Cannan]] (1861\u20131935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, [[Alfred Marshall]] (1842\u20131924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)<ref>Dahrendorf (1995), p.210-213</ref>\n\nThe dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser.<ref>Gerard Loot, cited in Dahrendorf (1995), P.212</ref> Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/41/1/307/2625390/The-London-and-Cambridge-Economic-Service-history?redirectedFrom=fulltext|title=The London and Cambridge Economic Service: history and contributions|author=Robert A.

The LSE Economist [[Lionel Robbins]] was also heavily involved. Starting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as [[Keynesian economics]], involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the [[Austrian School]], which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.<ref name=CambDebate/>\n\nDuring World War II, the School decamped from London to the [[University of Cambridge]], occupying buildings belonging to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album/hostel/hostel_03.jpg |title=Peterhouse Images |publisher=Peterhouse, Cambridge |accessdate=23 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001601/http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/images/display.html?image=album%2Fhostel%2Fhostel_03.jpg |archivedate=29 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe School's arms,<ref name=\"PlantArms\">{{cite web|first = Arnold|last = Plant|authorlink = Arnold Plant|title = File:\"Coat of arms of the London School of Economics and Political Science\"|url = http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/1-6%20original.jpg|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100531073327/http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/1-6%20original.jpg|url-status = dead|archive-date = 31 May 2010|publisher = Institute of Education|accessdate = 23 July 2009}}</ref> including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922,<ref name=\"IOEBeginnings\">{{cite web|title=London School of Economics |url=http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begslse.html |work=Beginnings: The History of Higher Education in Bloomsbury and Westminster |publisher=Institute of Education |accessdate=23 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926011322/http://beginnings.ioe.ac.uk/begslse.html |archivedate=26 September 2009 }}</ref> on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter.<ref name=\"LSEBeaverClub\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908033808/http://www.alumni.lse.ac.uk/olc/pub/LHE/filemanager/annualfund/giftclubs/beaversclub/default.htm|archive-date=8 September 2009|title = London School of Economics Online Community \u2013 Member Services|url = http://www.alumni.lse.ac.uk/olc/pub/LHE/filemanager/annualfund/giftclubs/beaversclub/default.htm|publisher=London School of Economics|accessdate =23 July 2009}}</ref> The Latin motto, {{Lang|la|rerum cognoscere causas}}, is taken from [[Virgil]]'s [[Georgics]].

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) worldwide on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million). At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids.

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) worldwide on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million). At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=INTERVIEW: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

{"title_page": "History of Bay Area Rapid Transit", "text_new": "{{Bay Area Rapid Transit sidebar}}\n'''[[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]''', widely known by the acronym '''BART''', is the main rail transportation system for the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It was envisioned as early as 1946 but the construction of the original system began in the 1960s.\n\n==Origins and planning==\n[[File:A Plan for Rapid Transit in San Francisco Consonant with the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (1960) (4007760726).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Envisioned master plan for rapid transit in San Francisco. BART was intended to take over existing rail corridors as well as incorporate new routes into the regional system. This map from 1960 included service through the [[Caltrain]] right of way as well as the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]], currently used for [[Muni Metro]] service, in addition to a [[Geary Subway]] and the constructed route down [[Mission Street]] (truncated to Balboa Park in this plan).]]\nThe idea of an underwater electric rail tube was first proposed in the early 1900s by [[Francis \"Borax\" Smith]] \u2013 the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' ran a front-page editorial in 1900 suggesting an electrified subway.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hartlaub|first1=Peter|title=For \u2018luxury\u2019 BART in 1965, the future looked shiny and bright|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/For-luxury-BART-in-1965-the-future-looked-9132869.php|accessdate=3 June 2017|agency=San Francisco Chronicle|date=10 August 2016}}</ref> There were also plans for a [[Third rail|third-rail]] powered subway line (''Twin Peaks Tunnel'') under Market Street in the 1910s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=REPORT ON MARKET STREET RAPID TRANSIT TUNNEL |journal=Electric Railway Journal |date=19 October 1912 |volume=XL |page=883 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY5MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA883#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> Much of BART's current coverage area was once served by the electrified [[streetcar]] and [[interurban]] train network called the '''[[Key System]]'''. This early twentieth century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower deck of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]]. The final passenger run occurred on April 20, 1958 and the entire system was soon dismantled in favor of automobiles and buses and the explosive growth of highway construction.\n\nProposals for the modern rapid transit system now in service began in 1946 by Bay Area business leaders concerned with increased post-war migration and growing congestion in the region. An Army-Navy task force concluded that an additional trans-bay crossing would soon be needed and recommended a tunnel; however, actual planning for a rapid transit system did not begin until the 1950s. In 1951, California's legislature created the San Francisco [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] Commission to study the Bay Area's long-term transportation needs. The commission's 1957 final report concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a high-speed rapid rail system linking the cities and  suburbs. Nine Bay Area counties were included in the initial planning commission.<ref name=\"barthistory\">{{cite web|url = http://www.bart.gov/about/history/history_1.asp|title = History of BART (1946\u20131972)|publisher = BART|accessdate = 2007-01-07|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060922184952/http://www.bart.gov/about/history/history_1.asp|archivedate = 2006-09-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BART 1958 logo.svg|thumb|left|Logo adopted by the five-county BARTD in 1958]]\nThe San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District was formed by the state legislature in 1957, comprising the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, [[Marin County, California|Marin]], San Francisco, and [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]]. Because [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] opted instead to first concentrate on its Expressway System, that county was not included in the original BART District. In 1959 a bill was passed in the state legislature that provided for the entire cost of construction of the tube to be paid for with surplus toll revenues from the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge. This represented a significant portion of the total cost of the system.<ref>See BART Composite Report, prepared by Parsons Brinkerhof Tutor Bechtel, 1962</ref>\n\nBy 1961 a plan for the new system was sent to the boards of supervisors of each of the five counties. These plans called for three branches traversing the [[San Francisco Bay]] and connecting [[Concord, California|Concord]] in the east, [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] in the northeast, [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] in the southeast; a crossing of the [[Golden Gate]] connecting San Francisco to [[Novato, California|Novato]] in the northwest; and a final branch running along [[San Francisco Peninsula|the Peninsula]] from [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].<ref name=\"1961Report\">{{cite web |title=Rapid Transit for the San Francisco Bay Area |url=http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/bart/1961-parsons-engineering-report-to-sf-bart-district.pdf |website=LA Metro Library |publisher=Parsons Brinkerhoff / Tudor / Bechtel |accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref> However, on April 12, 1962 San Mateo County opted out, citing high costs, [[Peninsula Commute|existing service]] provided by [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] commuter trains,<ref name=\"CoBHist\" /> and concerns over shoppers leaving their county for stores in San Francisco. This left Daly City (still in San Mateo County, but only a few feet across the county line) as the southwest terminus. Marin County followed soon thereafter in May,<ref name=\"CoBHist\" /> being forced out of the BART district due to engineering objections from the board of directors of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and fear that Marin voters would not approve the bonds, which had to win more than 60% approval.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/special_packages/bart/10597476.htm |title = History of BART to the South Bay |newspaper = the San Jose Mercury News |date = January 8, 2005 |accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref> The withdrawal also resulted in the cancellation of the [[Geary Subway]] section of the system.

Downtown Berkeley station would be located under Shattuck Square, while both Ashby and North Berkeley (referred to as Sacramento Street Station in the planning documents) were to be constructed on elevated segments. Residents eventually came to oppose this scheme in favor of one where the line would be run in a tunnel for its length. After several hearings, the city voted to tax themselves for the funds necessary to fully underground the line, to the amount of $20 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|20000000|1972}} }} adjusted for inflation).<ref name=\"CoBHist\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Looking Back at Berkeley: A Pictorial History of a Diverse City |publisher=Berkeley Historical Society |asin=B01N55Y7E8 |page=51}}</ref> BART estimates that the issue added $18 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|18000000|1972}} }} adjusted for inflation) to construction costs and delayed completion of the system.<ref name=\"CoBHist\" />\n\n===New rail technologies===\nAs one of the first entirely new rapid transit systems built from scratch in the 20th century, the architects of what would become BART intended to design a rail system that could be marketed to other cities and regions. This led to several unconventional design choices for the system.\n\nTracks were intended from the outset to utilize a [[broad gauge]] of {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}}, unusual in the Unites States. [[Parsons Brinkerhoff]] - Tutor Bechtel recommended the gauge for better stability and smoother riding; it was not selected for greater safety in high winds when crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, or for faster trains, contrary to myth.<ref name=\"bartgauge\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bayrailalliance.org/question/why-does-bart-use-wider-non-standard-guage-rails/ |title=Why does BART use wider, non-standard guage rails? |date=2013-03-24 |website=BayRail Alliance |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> Also, tracks were designed to utilize flat-edge rails and wheels. The [[railway electrification system|railway utilizes an electrical system]] powered at an unusual 1,000 [[volt]]s of [[direct current]]. (Historically, [[streetcars]] operated at 600 V and older subway systems tended to adopt this voltage, while new systems contemporary to BART and since usually use 750 V power.

System wide projects would include the construction of three underground rail stations in Oakland's populated downtown area, three stations through San Francisco's downtown beneath [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] (later expanded to four), as well as four other underground stations in other parts of San Francisco, three subterranean stations in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] (which paid more to bury them, in contrast to the stations in neighboring [[Oakland]] and [[El Cerrito, California|El Cerrito]]), as well as new maintenance facilities throughout the system.\n\nThe {{convert|3.2|mi}} [[Berkeley Hills Tunnel]] was constructed through [[active fault]]s between Berkeley and Orinda in order to avoid further use of the [[Caldecott Tunnel]].\n\nThe centerpiece of the system, the {{convert|3.6|mi}} [[Transbay Tube]], connected Oakland and San Francisco beneath the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Restoring transbay passenger rail service for the first time since Key System service was discontinued across the Bay Bridge, the tube is the world's longest and deepest [[immersed tube|immersed tunnel]] with a cost of  $180 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|180000000|1969}} }} adjusted for inflation) and was completed in August 1969. It was constructed in 57 sections, each positioned and installed individually by sinking them into a dredged trough across the bay (that was later filled in).\n\nBART constructed [[right-of-way]]s utilizing several rail and [[freeway]] corridors. For the initial system, these included: the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] right-of-way in Concord, Contra Costa Center and Walnut Creek; [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] and [[Interstate 980]] from the Berkeley Hills Tunnel to Oakland; [[Western Pacific Railroad]] from Fruitvale to [[Niles Canyon]];  [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] and Key System right-of-ways between Richmond and Berkeley (which also became the [[Ohlone Greenway]] and [[Richmond Greenway]]); and the [[San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway]]<ref name=\"1961Report\" /> and original [[Southern Pacific]] [[Peninsula Commute]]<ref name=\"Chronology\">{{Muni Chronology}}</ref> right-of-ways to Daly City.\n\nThe final ceremonial spike for the original system was placed in 1971.\n\n[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Berkeley station (bottom right) as seen in 1973, shortly after the station opened]]\n\n===Opening===\n{{BART 1976}}\nService began on September 11, 1972,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_29687067/has-barts-cutting-edge-1972-technology-design-come.html|title=Has BART\u2019s cutting-edge 1972 technology design come back to haunt it?|date=26 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> reporting more than 100,000 passengers in its first five days.

When revenue service began, \"ghost trains\" (or false occupancies), trains that show up on the computer system as being in a specific place but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system. This was the result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 [[volt]]s rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for train detection.<ref name=\"pushback\" /> Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}}. Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these \"ghost trains\" (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking&nbsp;\u2014 operators in a booth on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights \u2014 that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation between [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the [[California|state government]] (advised by University of California professor Dr. [[Bill Wattenburg]]), the [[United States|federal government]], and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service.<ref name=\"pushback\" /> Ghost trains persisted on the system as late as 2007, and while usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, they can occasionally cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system.<ref name=\"ghosttrain\">{{cite news|title='Ghost Train,' Malfunctions Causing BART Delays|url=http://www.foxreno.com/news/4204326/detail.html|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=[[Bay City News]]|publisher=FoxReno.com|date=February 16, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518074203/http://www.foxreno.com/news/4204326/detail.html|archivedate=May 18, 2006}}</ref>  In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.<ref name=\"pushback2\">\n{{cite web\n   |url        = http://www.pushback.com/Wattenburg/bio/BART.html\n   |title      = Magnetic Credit Cards\n   |publisher  = PushBack.com\n   |author     = Peter Sheerin\n   |date       = October 11, 2004\n   |accessdate = 2007-01-18\n    }}\n</ref>\n\nRunning logistics were originally handled from a ''central control room'', but that was replaced by the more modern Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the [[Kaiser Center]] in Downtown Oakland.\n\n===Train-control failures===\n[[File:BART Operations Control Center.jpg|thumb|left|500px|The BART Operations Control Center]]\nBefore the system began [[revenue service]], serious problems in the design and operation of the [[Automatic Train Control]] (ATC) system were observed.

The January 1, 2008 change eliminated most direct service between SFO and Millbrae on weekdays, except for a few morning and evening trips. Finally, in 2010 BART settled on a routing pattern that has Pittsburg/Bay Point trains running to SFO at all times. During peak times Mondays through Fridays, Richmond trains run directly to Millbrae without stopping at SFO. During off-peak hours (nights and weekends), Pittsburg/Bay Point trains served both SFO and Millbrae sequentially. Passengers on the Fremont, Richmond, and Dublin/Pleasanton lines had to transfer to the Pittsburg/Bay Point line to reach the airport. In addition, the cessation of direct BART service between Millbrae and SFO during weekday peak hours required Caltrain passengers wanting to travel to the airport from Millbrae had to travel to [[San Bruno (BART station)|San Bruno Station]] and make a transfer to an SFO train. This was mitigated on February 11, 2019 with the reintroduction of the [[SFO\u2013Millbrae_line|SFO-Millbrae]] shuttle train, providing a one-seat connection from the airport to Millbrae on weekdays and Sundays, with the Antioch-SFO line providing the connection on weeknights & saturdays.\n\n==Spur lines (1995\u20132018)==\nPart of San Mateo's buy in was used to offset funding for extensions of the core system in the East Bay.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Trains to [[North Concord/Martinez]] began on December 16, 1995 and to [[Pittsburg/Bay Point]] on December 7, 1996.

The '''[[Oakland Airport Connector]]''' was built as a replacement for the bus-serviced [[AirBART]] and brought the airport into the system's fare zone. The '''Coliseum\u2013Oakland International Airport line''', as it came to be known, utilizes [[automated guideway transit]] ('''AGT''') technology: cable-drawn cars that operate in discrete cable loops on guided rubber tires. The AGT's connection to the existing BART system at [[Oakland Coliseum Station|Coliseum Station]] resembles the [[AirTrain JFK]] and [[AirTrain Newark]] airport people movers' existing off-airport connections to other rail transit lines, though it is run by the transit authority itself rather than an out-of-system operator.

It was envisioned as early as 1946 but the construction of the original system began in the 1960s.\n\n==Origins and planning==\n[[File:A Plan for Rapid Transit in San Francisco Consonant with the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (1960) (4007760726).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Envisioned master plan for rapid transit in San Francisco. BART was intended to take over existing rail corridors as well as incorporate new routes into the regional system. This map from 1960 included service through the [[Caltrain]] right of way as well as the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]], currently used for [[Muni Metro]] service, in addition to a [[Geary Subway]] and the constructed route down [[Mission Street]] (truncated to Balboa Park in this plan).]]\nThe idea of an underwater electric rail tube was first proposed in the early 1900s by [[Francis \"Borax\" Smith]] \u2013 the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' ran a front-page editorial in 1900 suggesting an electrified subway.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hartlaub|first1=Peter|title=For \u2018luxury\u2019 BART in 1965, the future looked shiny and bright|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/For-luxury-BART-in-1965-the-future-looked-9132869.php|accessdate=3 June 2017|agency=San Francisco Chronicle|date=10 August 2016}}</ref> There were also plans for a [[Third rail|third-rail]] powered subway line (''Twin Peaks Tunnel'') under Market Street in the 1910s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=REPORT ON MARKET STREET RAPID TRANSIT TUNNEL |journal=Electric Railway Journal |date=19 October 1912 |volume=XL |page=883 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY5MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA883#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> Much of BART's current coverage area was once served by the electrified [[streetcar]] and [[interurban]] train network called the '''[[Key System]]'''. This early twentieth century system once had regular transbay traffic across the lower deck of the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]]. The final passenger run occurred on April 20, 1958 and the entire system was soon dismantled in favor of automobiles and buses and the explosive growth of highway construction.\n\nProposals for the modern rapid transit system now in service began in 1946 by Bay Area business leaders concerned with increased post-war migration and growing congestion in the region. An Army-Navy task force concluded that an additional trans-bay crossing would soon be needed and recommended a tunnel; however, actual planning for a rapid transit system did not begin until the 1950s. In 1951, California's legislature created the San Francisco [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] Commission to study the Bay Area's long-term transportation needs. The commission's 1957 final report concluded the most cost-effective solution for the Bay Area's traffic woes would be to form a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a high-speed rapid rail system linking the cities and  suburbs. Nine Bay Area counties were included in the initial planning commission.<ref name=\"barthistory\">{{cite web|url = http://www.bart.gov/about/history/history_1.asp|title = History of BART (1946\u20131972)|publisher = BART|accessdate = 2007-01-07|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060922184952/http://www.bart.gov/about/history/history_1.asp|archivedate = 2006-09-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BART 1958 logo.svg|thumb|left|Logo adopted by the five-county BARTD in 1958]]\nThe San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District was formed by the state legislature in 1957, comprising the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, [[Marin County, California|Marin]], San Francisco, and [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo]]. Because [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] opted instead to first concentrate on its Expressway System, that county was not included in the original BART District. In 1959 a bill was passed in the state legislature that provided for the entire cost of construction of the tube to be paid for with surplus toll revenues from the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge. This represented a significant portion of the total cost of the system.<ref>See BART Composite Report, prepared by Parsons Brinkerhof Tutor Bechtel, 1962</ref>\n\nBy 1961 a plan for the new system was sent to the boards of supervisors of each of the five counties. These plans called for three branches traversing the [[San Francisco Bay]] and connecting [[Concord, California|Concord]] in the east, [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] in the northeast, [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] in the southeast; a crossing of the [[Golden Gate]] connecting San Francisco to [[Novato, California|Novato]] in the northwest; and a final branch running along [[San Francisco Peninsula|the Peninsula]] from [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].<ref name=\"1961Report\">{{cite web |title=Rapid Transit for the San Francisco Bay Area |url=http://libraryarchives.metro.net/DPGTL/bart/1961-parsons-engineering-report-to-sf-bart-district.pdf |website=LA Metro Library |publisher=Parsons Brinkerhoff / Tudor / Bechtel |accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref> However, on April 12, 1962 San Mateo County opted out, citing high costs, [[Peninsula Commute|existing service]] provided by [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] commuter trains,<ref name=CoBHist /> and concerns over shoppers leaving their county for stores in San Francisco.

Downtown Berkeley station would be located under Shattuck Square, while both Ashby and North Berkeley (referred to as Sacramento Street Station in the planning documents) were to be constructed on elevated segments. Residents eventually came to oppose this scheme in favor of one where the line would be run in a tunnel for its length.

This led to several unconventional design choices for the system.\n\nTracks were intended from the outset to utilize a [[broad gauge]] of {{Track gauge|5ft6in|lk=on}}, unusual in the Unites States. [[Parsons Brinkerhoff]] - Tutor Bechtel recommended the gauge for better stability and smoother riding; it was not selected for greater safety in high winds when crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, or for faster trains, contrary to myth.<ref name=\"bartgauge\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bayrailalliance.org/question/why-does-bart-use-wider-non-standard-guage-rails/ |title=Why does BART use wider, non-standard guage rails? |date=2013-03-24 |website=BayRail Alliance |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> Also, tracks were designed to utilize flat-edge rails and wheels. The [[railway electrification system|railway utilizes an electrical system]] powered at an unusual 1,000 [[volt]]s of [[direct current]].

System wide projects would include the construction of three underground rail stations in Oakland's populated downtown area, three stations through San Francisco's downtown beneath [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] (later expanded to four), as well as four other underground stations in other parts of San Francisco, three subterranean stations in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] (which paid more to bury them, in contrast to the stations in neighboring [[Oakland]] and [[El Cerrito, California|El Cerrito]]), as well as new maintenance facilities throughout the system.\n\nThe {{convert|3.2|mi}} [[Berkeley Hills Tunnel]] was constructed through [[active fault]]s between Berkeley and Orinda in order to avoid further use of the [[Caldecott Tunnel]].\n\nThe centerpiece of the system, the {{convert|3.6|mi}} [[Transbay Tube]], connected Oakland and San Francisco beneath the [[San Francisco Bay]]. Restoring transbay passenger rail service for the first time since Key System service was discontinued across the Bay Bridge, the tube is the world's longest and deepest [[immersed tube|immersed tunnel]] with a cost of  $180 million (${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|180000000|1969}} }} adjusted for inflation) and was completed in August 1969. It was constructed in 57 sections, each positioned and installed individually by sinking them into a dredged trough across the bay (that was later filled in).\n\nBART constructed [[right-of-way]]s utilizing several rail and [[freeway]] corridors. For the initial system, these included: the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] right-of-way in Concord, Contra Costa Center and Walnut Creek; [[California State Route 24|State Route 24]] and [[Interstate 980]] from the Berkeley Hills Tunnel to Oakland; [[Western Pacific Railroad]] from Fruitvale to [[Niles Canyon]];  [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] and Key System right-of-ways between Richmond and Berkeley (which also became the [[Ohlone Greenway]] and [[Richmond Greenway]]); and the [[San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway]]<ref name=\"1961Report\" /> and original [[Southern Pacific]] [[Peninsula Commute]]<ref name=Chronology>{{Muni Chronology}}</ref> right-of-ways to Daly City.\n\nThe final ceremonial spike for the original system was placed in 1971.\n\n[[File:Berkeley BART Station 1973 Postcard.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Berkeley station (bottom right) as seen in 1973, shortly after the station opened]]\n\n===Opening===\n{{BART 1976}}\nService began on September 11, 1972,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_29687067/has-barts-cutting-edge-1972-technology-design-come.html|title=Has BART\u2019s cutting-edge 1972 technology design come back to haunt it?|date=26 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> reporting more than 100,000 passengers in its first five days.

When revenue service began, \"ghost trains\" (or false occupancies), trains that show up on the computer system as being in a specific place but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system. This was the result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 [[volt]]s rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for train detection.<ref name=pushback /> Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}}. Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these \"ghost trains\" (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking&nbsp;\u2014 operators in a booth on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights \u2014 that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation between [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the [[California|state government]] (advised by University of California professor Dr. [[Bill Wattenburg]]), the [[United States|federal government]], and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service.<ref name=pushback /> Ghost trains persisted on the system as late as 2007, and while usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, they can occasionally cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system.<ref name=\"ghosttrain\">{{cite news|title='Ghost Train,' Malfunctions Causing BART Delays|url=http://www.foxreno.com/news/4204326/detail.html|accessdate=January 29, 2018|work=[[Bay City News]]|publisher=FoxReno.com|date=February 16, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518074203/http://www.foxreno.com/news/4204326/detail.html|archivedate=May 18, 2006}}</ref>  In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.<ref name=pushback2>\n{{cite web\n   |url        = http://www.pushback.com/Wattenburg/bio/BART.html\n   |title      = Magnetic Credit Cards\n   |publisher  = PushBack.com\n   |author     = Peter Sheerin\n   |date       = October 11, 2004\n   |accessdate = 2007-01-18\n    }}\n</ref>\n\nRunning logistics were originally handled from a ''central control room'', but that was replaced by the more modern Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the [[Kaiser Center]] in Downtown Oakland.\n\n===Train-control failures===\n[[File:BART Operations Control Center.jpg|thumb|left|500px|The BART Operations Control Center]]\nBefore the system began [[revenue service]], serious problems in the design and operation of the [[Automatic Train Control]] (ATC) system were observed.

The train entered the SFO stub-end station under the control of the primary operator and exited in the opposite direction towards Millbrae controlled by the secondary.

The January 1, 2008 change eliminated most direct service between SFO and Millbrae on weekdays, except for a few morning and evening trips. Finally, in 2010 BART settled on a routing pattern that has Pittsburg/Bay Point trains running to SFO at all times. During peak times Mondays through Fridays, Richmond trains run directly to Millbrae without stopping at SFO. During off-peak hours (nights and weekends), Pittsburg/Bay Point trains served both SFO and Millbrae sequentially. Passengers on the Fremont, Richmond, and Dublin/Pleasanton lines had to transfer to the Pittsburg/Bay Point line to reach the airport. In addition, the cessation of direct BART service between Millbrae and SFO during weekday peak hours required Caltrain passengers wanting to travel to the airport from Millbrae had to travel to [[San Bruno (BART station)|San Bruno Station]] and make a transfer to an SFO train. This was mitigated on February 11, 2019 with the reintroduction of the [[SFO\u2013Millbrae_line|SFO-Millbrae]] shuttle train, providing a one-seat connection from the airport to Millbrae on weekdays and Sundays, with the Antioch-SFO line providing the connection on weeknights & saturdays.\n\n==Spur lines (1995\u20132018)==\nPart of San Mateo's buy in was used to offset funding for extensions of the core system in the East Bay.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Trains to [[North Concord/Martinez]] began on December 16, 1995 and to [[Pittsburg/Bay Point]] on December 7, 1996.

The '''[[Oakland Airport Connector]]''' was built as a replacement for the bus-serviced [[AirBART]] and brought the airport into the system's fare zone. The '''Coliseum\u2013Oakland International Airport line''', as it came to be known, utilizes [[automated guideway transit]] ('''AGT''') technology: cable-drawn cars that operate in discrete cable loops on guided rubber tires. The AGT's connection to the existing BART system at [[Oakland Coliseum Station|Coliseum Station]] resembles the [[AirTrain JFK]] and [[AirTrain Newark]] airport people movers' existing off-airport connections to other rail transit lines, though it is run by the transit authority itself rather than an out-of-system operator.

These electronic signals travel much faster than seismic waves. For quakes outside the Bay Area, they provide advance notice that shaking is on the way; for quakes in the Bay Area, they provide an earlier warning. If the seismic network warns of ground motion above a threshold, the train control computers will order \u201cservice\u201d braking, slowing from normal speeds of up to {{convert|70|mph|kph}} to {{convert|26|mph|kph}} .\n\n\u201cThe earthquake early warning system will enable BART to stop trains before earthquake shaking starts and thereby prevent derailment, and save passengers from potential injuries\u201d, said BART Board President John McPartland. \u201cWe are the first transit agency in the United States to provide this early warning and intervention.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2012/news20120927.aspx |title=BART teams with UC Berkeley to adopt earthquake early warning system |publisher=Bay Area Rapid Transit District |date=September 29, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|3.6|mi|km|adj=on}} Transbay Tube has also required earthquake retrofitting.

This fill may be prone to [[soil liquefaction]] during an earthquake, which could allow the [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] hollow tube to break loose from its anchorages. Retrofitting outside the tube compacted the fill, to make it denser and less prone to liquefaction. Inside the tube, BART installed heavy steel plates, to reduce sideways movement in an earthquake. The work was performed between March and December 2013, and BART closed one of the two bores of the tube early on some weeknights.

This resulted in a four-year contract offering a seven percent raise, and a one-time payment of $3,000 to all employees in lieu of a raise the first year.

In ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', Badb, Macha and Morr\u00edgan make up the Morr\u00edgna trinity and are named as daughters of the farming goddess [[Ernmas]].<ref name=\"Invasions\"/> According to this version, she is also the sister of [[\u00c9riu]], [[Banba]] and [[F\u00f3dla]], the three matron goddesses of Ireland, who give their names to the land.<ref name=\"Invasions\"/> Other accounts identify the trio as daughters of the druid Cailitin and his wife.\n\n''Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn'' also states that Badb is one of the two wives of the war god [[Neit]].<ref name=\"Invasions\" /> Less commonly, she has been described as the wife of the Fomorian king [[Tethra]].<ref name=\"Dictionary\" />\n\n===Similar deities===\nIn her role as a terrifying battlefield goddess and harbinger of doom, Badb closely resembles [[Nemain]].  Like Badb, Nemain is identified as a wife of Neit.  Writers have sometimes used their names interchangeably, suggesting that they may in fact be a single goddess.<ref name=\"Dictionary\" /> On the other hand, [[W. M. Hennessy]] notes that Badb and Nemain were said to have different sets of parents, suggesting that they may not be entirely identical figures.<ref name=\"Ancient\" />\n\nBadb also appears to be closely related to the [[Gaulish]] goddess [[Catubodua]], or Bodua.<ref name=\"Dictionary\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nPointing to variants such as Irish ''badhbh'' 'hoodie crow, a fairy, a scold,' Early Irish ''badb'', 'crow, demon,' ''Badba'', Welsh ''bod'', 'kite,' the Gaulish name ''Bodv''-, in ''Bodvo-gnatus'' and the Welsh name ''Bodnod'', Macbain (1982) suggests *''bodw\u0101''- as the [[Proto-Celtic]] ancestral form. However, [[Julius Pokorny]] (1959:203) suggests *''badw\u0101''- on the basis of similar data. Both MacBain (1982) and [[Julius Pokorny]] (1959:203) correlate the element with [[Old Norse|Norse]] ''b\u00f6\u00f0'', [[genitive]] ''bo\u00f0var'', 'war,' and Anglo-Saxon ''beadu'', [[genitive]] ''beadwe'', 'battle,' suggesting that the word originally denoted '[[Enyo|battle]]' or '[[Eris (mythology)|strife]].' [[Julius Pokorny]] (1959:203) presents the element as an extended form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''bhedh''- 'pierce, dig.' To this root Pokorny also links the Sanskrit ''b\u00e1dhate'', 'oppress,' and the Lithuanian ''b\u00e1das'', 'famine'.\n\nW. M. Hennessy argues that the word ''bodb'' or ''badb'' originally meant ''rage'', ''fury'', or ''violence'', and came to mean a witch, fairy, or goddess, represented in folklore by the scald-crow, or royston-crow<ref name=\"Ancient\">Hennessy, W. M., \"The Ancient Irish Goddess of War\", ''Revue Celtique'' 1, 1870\u201372, pp. 32\u201337</ref>. Peter O'Connell's 1819 ''Irish Dictionary'' defines the Badb as a \"''[[banshee|bean-sidhe]]'', a female fairy, phantom, or spectre, supposed to be attached to certain families, and to appear sometimes in the form of squall-crows, or royston-crows\" and ''badb-catha'' as \"''Fionog'', a royston-crow, a squall crow\". Other entries relate to her triple nature: \"''Macha'', i. e. a royston-crow; ''Morrighain'', i. e. the great fairy; ''Neamhan'', i. e.

In ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', Badb, Macha and Morr\u00edgan make up the Morr\u00edgna trinity and are named as daughters of the farming goddess [[Ernmas]].<ref name=\"Invasions\"/> According to this version, she is also the sister of [[\u00c9riu]], [[Banba]] and [[F\u00f3dla]], the three matron goddesses of Ireland, who give their names to the land.<ref name=\"Invasions\"/> Other accounts identify the trio as daughters of the druid Cailitin and his wife.\n\n''Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn'' also states that Badb is one of the two wives of the war god [[Neit]].<ref name=\"Invasions\" /> Less commonly, she has been described as the wife of the Fomorian king [[Tethra]].<ref name=\"Dictionary\" />\n\n===Similar deities===\nIn her role as a terrifying battlefield goddess and harbinger of doom, Badb closely resembles [[Nemain]].  Like Badb, Nemain is identified as a wife of Neit and is sometimes listed as one of the three Morr\u00edgna.  Writers have sometimes used their names interchangeably, suggesting that they may in fact be a single goddess.<ref name=\"Dictionary\" /> On the other hand, [[W. M. Hennessy]] notes that Badb and Nemain were said to have different sets of parents, suggesting that they may not be entirely identical figures.<ref name=\"Ancient\" />\n\nBadb also appears to be closely related to the [[Gaulish]] goddess [[Catubodua]], or Bodua.<ref name=\"Dictionary\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nPointing to variants such as Irish ''badhbh'' 'hoodie crow, a fairy, a scold,' Early Irish ''badb'', 'crow, demon,' ''Badba'', Welsh ''bod'', 'kite,' the Gaulish name ''Bodv''-, in ''Bodvo-gnatus'' and the Welsh name ''Bodnod'', Macbain (1982) suggests *''bodw\u0101''- as the [[Proto-Celtic]] ancestral form. However, [[Julius Pokorny]] (1959:203) suggests *''badw\u0101''- on the basis of similar data. Both MacBain (1982) and [[Julius Pokorny]] (1959:203) correlate the element with [[Old Norse|Norse]] ''b\u00f6\u00f0'', [[genitive]] ''bo\u00f0var'', 'war,' and Anglo-Saxon ''beadu'', [[genitive]] ''beadwe'', 'battle,' suggesting that the word originally denoted '[[Enyo|battle]]' or '[[Eris (mythology)|strife]].' [[Julius Pokorny]] (1959:203) presents the element as an extended form of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''bhedh''- 'pierce, dig.' To this root Pokorny also links the Sanskrit ''b\u00e1dhate'', 'oppress,' and the Lithuanian ''b\u00e1das'', 'famine'.\n\nW. M. Hennessy argues that the word ''bodb'' or ''badb'' originally meant ''rage'', ''fury'', or ''violence'', and came to mean a witch, fairy, or goddess, represented in folklore by the scald-crow, or royston-crow<ref name=\"Ancient\">Hennessy, W. M., \"The Ancient Irish Goddess of War\", ''Revue Celtique'' 1, 1870\u201372, pp. 32\u201337</ref>. Peter O'Connell's 1819 ''Irish Dictionary'' defines the Badb as a \"''[[banshee|bean-sidhe]]'', a female fairy, phantom, or spectre, supposed to be attached to certain families, and to appear sometimes in the form of squall-crows, or royston-crows\" and ''badb-catha'' as \"''Fionog'', a royston-crow, a squall crow\". Other entries relate to her triple nature: \"''Macha'', i. e. a royston-crow; ''Morrighain'', i. e. the great fairy; ''Neamhan'', i. e.

Union|Soviet]] [[Politician|statesman]] who led the Soviet Union during part of the [[Cold War]] as the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|first secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1953 to 1964 and as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]] (or premier) from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was responsible for the [[de-Stalinization]] of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early [[Soviet space program]], and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier.\n\nKhrushchev was born in 1894 in the village of [[Kalinovka, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Kalinovka]], close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was employed as a [[metal worker]] during his youth, and he was a [[political commissar]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. With the help of [[Lazar Kaganovich]], he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]], and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the [[Ukrainian SSR]], and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] ([[Eastern Front of World War II]]), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody [[defense of Stalingrad]], a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.\n\nOn 5 March 1953, Stalin\u2019s death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary. On 25 February 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], he delivered the \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]\", which denounced [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Stalin's purges]] and ushered in [[Khrushchev Thaw|a less repressive era]] in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite the cuts, Khrushchev's rule saw the most tense years of the Cold War, culminating in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\nKhrushchev's popularity was eroded by flaws in his policies. This emboldened his potential opponents, who quietly rose in strength and deposed the Premier in October 1964. However, he did not suffer the deadly fate of previous Soviet power struggles, and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a ''[[dacha]]'' in the countryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970.

Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nKalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=27}} Nikita worked as a [[Herder|herdsboy]] from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a [[Freethought|freethinker]] who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}} She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}}\n\nIn 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of [[Donetsk|Yuzovka]] (now Donetsk, [[Ukraine]]); fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and [[Donetsk]] in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=6\u20137}} He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the [[Lena Goldfields Massacre]], and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=37\u201338}} where his father was the union organiser, and he helped distribute copies and organise public readings of ''[[Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=8}} He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=141}}\n[[File:1916.

He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=8\u20139}} In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nAfter the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] in 1917, the new [[Russian Provisional Government]] in [[Petrograd]] had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or ''soviet'') in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=47}} He did not join the [[Bolshevik]]s until 1918, a year in which the [[Russian Civil War]], between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the [[White Movement|White Army]], began in earnest. His biographer, [[William Taubman]], suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the [[Menshevik]]s who prioritised economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47\u201348}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nIn March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|a separate peace]] with the [[Central Powers]], [[Ukrainian War of Independence#German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918|the Germans occupied the Donbas]] and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the [[Red Army]] as a [[political commissar]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=48\u201349}} The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=12}} though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} In 1921, [[Russian Civil War|the civil war]] ended, and Khrushchev was demobilised and assigned as commissar to a labour brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}\n\nThe wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of [[typhus]] in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|Bolshevik principles]], refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}\n\n== Party official ==\n=== Donbas years ===\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n[[File:NikitaNina.JPG|thumb|Khrushchev's second wife (though they were never officially married) was Ukrainian-born [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], whom he met in 1922]]\nKhrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to [[Donetsk National Technical University|the newly established technical college]] (''tekhnikum'') in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (''[[rabfak]]'') attached to the ''tekhnikum'' that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the ''tekhnikum''.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} While enrolled in the ''[[rabfak]]'', Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=14}} One of his teachers later described him as a poor student.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} He was more successful in advancing in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]; soon after his admission to the ''rabfak'' in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire ''tekhnikum'', and became a member of the bureau\u2014the governing council\u2014of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of [[Leon Trotsky]] against those of [[Joseph Stalin]] over the question of party democracy.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56\u201357}} All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his ''rabfak'' studies, it is unclear whether this was true.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nKhrushchev's studies were aided by [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants, according to some sources.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=58\u201359}} The family was poor, according to Nina's own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.\n\nIn mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky ''[[raikom]]'', or district, near Stalino. The ''[[raikom]]'' was about {{convert|400|sqmi|km2}} in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=16\u201317}} In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party]] in Moscow.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=63}}\n\n=== Kaganovich prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[NKVD]] chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]], 1935.

In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64\u201366}} and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage,{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of the Stalino party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64\u201366}} Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to [[Kharkov]], then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=66}} In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to [[Kiev]], where he served as second-in-command of the Party organization there.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=68}}\n\nIn 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the [[Kremlin]] as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the [[Industrial Academy (Moscow)|Stalin Industrial Academy]]. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} When the school's Party cell elected a number of [[rightists]] to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in ''[[Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31\u201332}} Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31\u201332}} Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the [[Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow city Party organization]], and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} and a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party's Central Committee]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=78}} Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]], Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nWhile head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended construction of the [[Moscow Metro]], a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the [[Order of Lenin]] for his role in its construction.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=94\u201395}} Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the [[Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow Regional Committee]] which was responsible for [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow ''oblast'']], a province with a population of 11&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}}\n\n=== Involvement in purges ===\n[[File:Khrushchyov, Beria and Khanjian.jpg|thumb| [[Nestor Lakoba]], Khrushchev, [[Lavrenti Beria]] and [[Aghasi Khanjian]] during opening of the [[Moscow Metro]] in 1936.]]\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's ''dacha'', while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=105\u201306}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0426\u0418\u041a \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420.jpg|thumb|right|Khrushchev (sitting first from left), head of Moscow party branch, with various regional party leaders in 1935. Standing first from right is [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]]]]\nBeginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the [[Great Purge]], during which millions of people were executed or sent to the [[Gulag]]. Central to this campaign were the [[Moscow Trials]], a series of [[show trial]]s of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\n\n<blockquote>\nEveryone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-[[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinovievite]] gang. That word is execution.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=98}}\n</blockquote>\n\nKhrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow ''oblast''.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} Of 38&nbsp;top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}}\u2014the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=57}} Of the 146&nbsp;Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=99\u2013100}} By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}\n\nParty leaders were given numerical quotas of \"enemies\" to be turned in and arrested.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}} In June 1937, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] set a quota of 35,000&nbsp;enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000&nbsp;wealthy peasants, or ''[[kulak]]s'' living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305&nbsp;\"criminal and ''kulak'' elements\" had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}\n\nKhrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, \"blanched\" (for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=103\u201304}} Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an [[enemy of the people]] then and there.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=104}} Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=69}}\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhDPL92SOY Khrushchev speech in 1937]}}\nIn late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party in Ukraine]], and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=114\u201315}} Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=116}} All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=60}}\n\nBiographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying \"Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}}\n\n== World War II ==\n=== Occupation of Polish territory ===\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded the eastern portion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the [[Western Ukraine|western portion of Ukraine]]. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|USSR Supreme Soviet]], and Western Ukraine became a part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Ukrainian SSR) on 1 November 1939.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=135\u201337}} Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with [[Eastern Ukraine|Eastern Ukrainians]], and giving confiscated land to collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]es'') rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=72}}\n\n=== War against Germany ===\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the USSR]], in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=149}} Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=150}} As the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military in an attempt to defend and save Kiev. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|encircled by the Germans]]. While the Germans stated they took 655,000&nbsp;prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541&nbsp;men out of 677,085 escaped the trap.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=163}} Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement at this point. According to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Georgi Zhukov]], writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=162\u201364}} However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]] proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|p=347}} Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:\n\n{{quote|But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished&nbsp;... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy.&nbsp;... There you have the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result we simply lost them.&nbsp;... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|pp=349\u201350}}}}\n\nIn 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the [[Kharkov]] area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000&nbsp;Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to [[Second Battle of Kharkov|attack at Kharkov]], and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000&nbsp;soldiers, including more than 200,000&nbsp;men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to [[Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=164\u201368}}\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 882837 The defenders of Stalingrad.jpg|thumb|left|Khrushchev (left) on the Stalingrad Front]]\nKhrushchev reached the [[Stalingrad Front]] in August 1942, soon after the start of [[Battle of Stalingrad|the battle for the city]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168\u201371}} His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major\u2014General [[Vasily Chuikov]], who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier\u2014but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=81}} Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a [[counterattack]], only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned [[Operation Uranus]], a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before ''Uranus'' was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168\u201371}}\n\nSoon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son [[Leonid Khrushchev|Leonid]], a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial,{{sfn|Birch|2008}} as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate has been the subject of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life.{{sfn|Birch|2008}} This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech.{{sfn|Birch|2008}}{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=157\u201358}} While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=82}} In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=158}} In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=158\u201362}}\n\nAfter ''Uranus'' forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served in other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the [[Battle of Kursk]], in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=171\u201372}} Khrushchev related that he interrogated an [[SS]] defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack\u2014a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as \"almost certainly exaggerated\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177\u201378}} He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177\u201378}} As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAccording to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era were generally favorable, at a time when it was \"barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context\".{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}} Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}}\n\n== Rise to power ==\n=== Return to Ukraine ===\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=179}}\n\nKhrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine, but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=180}} As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000&nbsp;men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=193\u201395}} Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}}\n\nIn an effort to increase agricultural production, the ''[[kolkhoz]]es'' (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. ''Kolkhoz'' leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly 12,000&nbsp;people were sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} He also worked to impose [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=87\u201388}} The partisans, many of whom fought as the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 \"bandits\" and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}} About 600,000&nbsp;Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}}\n\nThe war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} The [[Soviet government]] sought to collect as much grain as possible in order to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=199}} Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=199\u2013200}} Food was rationed\u2014but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions, and was little noticed outside the USSR.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free [[soup kitchen]]s.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=200\u2013201}} However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to \"help\" Khrushchev.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=92}} The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}}\n\nSoon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}} However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in [[Latvia]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}} Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet [[Kaliningrad]], where he toured factories and quarries.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=27}} By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favour of [[Demyan Korotchenko]], Khrushchev's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}}\n\nKhrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=95}} Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=205}} Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=96}} With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a \"rural proletariat\", Khrushchev conceived the idea of the \"agro-town\".{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96\u201397}} Rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nIn his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine, where he governed for over a decade:\n\n<blockquote>\nI'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction&nbsp;... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts&nbsp;... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=16\u201317}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Stalin's final years ===\nKhrushchev attributed his recall to [[Moscow]] to mental disorder on the part of [[Stalin]], who feared conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated [[Leningrad case]], in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=18\u201322}} Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of [[Georgy Malenkov]] and security chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=210}}\n\nAt this time, the ageing leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin. These sessions, which Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], and [[Nikolai Bulganin]], who comprised Stalin's inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favoured by Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211\u201315}} Stolen from the West, they lacked subtitles.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211\u201315}} The dictator had the meal served at around 1&nbsp;a.m., and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn. On one occasion, Stalin had Khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance [[hopak|a traditional Ukrainian dance]]. Khrushchev did so, later stating, \"When Stalin says dance, a wise man dances.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211\u201315}} Khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=43}}\n\nIn 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. A large part of the housing was in the form of five- or six-story apartment buildings, which became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union; many remain in use today.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=99}} Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=226}} These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946\u20131950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed ''[[Khrushchyovka]]'' by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called ''Khrushchoba'' as a [[portmanteau]] combining Khrushchev's name with the Russian word ''trushchoba'', meaning \"slum\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Vocabulary of Soviet Society and Culture: A Selected Guide to Russian Words, Idioms, and Expressions of the Post-Stalin Era, 1953\u20131991 |author=Irina H.

This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=100\u201301}} Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in ''[[Pravda]]'' in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=228\u201330}}\n\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin suffered a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. Stalin had left orders not to be disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered. Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=236\u201341}}\n\nKhrushchev reflected on Stalin in his memoirs:\n\n<blockquote>\nStalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an \"enemy of the people.\" He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, \"the enemies of the people\" had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal&nbsp;... <nowiki>[P]</nowiki>eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never!&nbsp;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=167\u201368}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Struggle for control ===\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|first vice-chairmen]]. [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin#Funeral service|Stalin's funeral]] was conducted on 9 March. Those members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee]] who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=114}} ''The New York Times'' listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium\u2014and Khrushchev last.{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1953-03-10}}\n\nHowever, on 14 March, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries\u2014indicating that he was now in charge of the party.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614785/Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"] at ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''</ref> The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=258}}\n\nEven before Stalin had been laid to rest, Beria launched a lengthy series of reforms which rivalled those of Khrushchev during his period of power and even those of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] a third of a century later.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} Beria's proposals were designed to denigrate Stalin and pass the blame for Beria's own crimes to the late leader.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million prisoners.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=246}} Another, which was not adopted, was to release [[East Germany]] into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=247}}\u2014a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=184}} Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=121}} and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that \"Beria is getting his knives ready for us.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=186}} The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria's most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard.<ref>Timothy K.  Blauvelt, \"Patronage and betrayal in the post-Stalin succession: The case of Kruglov and Serov\" ''Communist & Post-Communist Studies'' (2008) 43#1 pp 105\u201320.</ref> On 26 June 1953 Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret, and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates. The execution of Beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top-level Soviet power struggle paid with his life.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=123}}\n\nThe power struggle in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=125\u201326}} Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}}\n\nKhrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}} Khrushchev arranged for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] grounds to be opened to the public, an act with \"great public resonance\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=263}} While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader, and included the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]], under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern [[Kazakhstan]]. While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture, it was initially successful.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=174}} In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the [[KGB]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=260\u2013264}}\n\nAt a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the [[Leningrad affair|Leningrad case]], and of facilitating Beria's climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial [[Supreme Soviet]] the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favour of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=15\u201317}} Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, \"Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the [[collective leadership]] was now beyond any reasonable doubt.\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=141\u201342}}\n\nThe post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign-policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by the European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts, and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality\u2014he remained unpredictable, and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev's policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik, but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.<ref>Paul  Marantz, \"Internal Politics and Soviet Foreign Policy: A Case Study.\" ''Western Political Quarterly'' 28.1 (1975): 130\u201346.

Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=266\u201367}} The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=27}} Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=268\u201369}}\n\nBy the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the [[gulag|gulag labor camps]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=275}} Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=276}} Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]] about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279\u201380}}\n\nThe 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with [[Klement Gottwald]] and the little-known [[Kyuichi Tokuda]].{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=153}} In the early morning hours of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the \"[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]\" to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the \"congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=212}} Khrushchev told the delegates:\n\n{{quote|It is here that Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power&nbsp;... he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies, but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the Soviet Government.{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1956-05-06}}}}\n\nThe Secret Speech, while it did not fundamentally change Soviet society, had wide-ranging effects. The speech was a factor in [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|unrest in Poland]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|revolution in Hungary]] later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led [[1956 Georgian demonstrations|four days of rioting]] in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=286\u201391}} In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], then a [[Komsomol]] official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=286\u201391}} Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be \"a moral man after all\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=282}}\n\nThe term \"Secret Speech\" proved to be an utter misnomer. While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked \"not for the press\" rather than \"top secret\". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279\u201380}} Khrushchev's son, [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]], later wrote, \"<nowiki>[C]</nowiki>learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech&nbsp;... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=200}}\n\nThe anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through [[List of Ministers of Defense of the Soviet Union|Minister of Defense]] Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the [[Anti-Party Group]], accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client [[Dmitri Shepilov]] who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to [[Mongolia]]; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=176\u201383}}\n\nMarshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=361\u201364}} Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the ''[[Gosbank]]'') and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}} Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}}\n\n====Liberalization and the arts====\n{{main|Khrushchev Thaw}}\n[[File:Dwight Eisenhower Nikita Khrushchev and their wives at state dinner 1959.png|thumb|[[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Khrushcheva]], [[Mamie Eisenhower]], Khrushchev, and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] at a [[state dinner]] in 1959]]\n[[File:Khrushchev family at the Waldorf-Astoria 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Khrushchev, his wife, his son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] (far right) and his daughter [[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0436\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0439, \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430|Rada]] during their trip to USA in 1959]]\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. [[Vladimir Dudintsev]]'s ''[[Not by Bread Alone]]'',{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=307}} about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=308}} In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on [[Boris Pasternak]] after his novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). ''Pravda'' described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=385}} Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], but under heavy pressure he declined it. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=385}} After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read it myself. There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=628}}\n\nKhrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DkdGcjM7tQ Khrushchev speech, Los Angeles, 19 September 1959]. Youtube</ref> and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=175}} Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=172}} Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over two million Soviet citizens travelled abroad between 1957 and 1961, 700,000 of whom visited the West) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=172}} In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students]] to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed [[Komsomol]] officials to \"smother foreign guests in our embrace\".{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=174}} The resulting \"socialist carnival\" involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|pp=174\u201375}} According to historian [[Vladislav Zubok]], the festival \"shattered propagandist clich\u00e9s\" about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=175}}\n\nIn 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'', persuaded the Presidium to allow publication.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=525\u201328}} That renewed thaw ended on 1 December 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the [[Manezh Gallery]] to view an exhibit which included a number of [[avant-garde]] works. On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]], describing the artwork as \"dog shit\",{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=257\u201360}} and proclaiming that \"a donkey could smear better art with its tail\".{{sfn|Neizvestny|1979}} A week later, ''Pravda'' issued a call for artistic purity. When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them. However, despite the premier's rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open for some time after Khrushchev's visit, and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in ''Pravda''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=257\u201360}}\n\n==== Political reform ====\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. These tribunals (known as ''[[NKVD troika|troikas]]''), had often ignored laws and procedures. Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee. This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. Instead, other sanctions were imposed on [[Soviet dissidents]], including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party. During Khrushchev's rule, [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|forced hospitalization]] for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=41\u201342}} According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\".{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n[[File:Nikita-Khrushchev-TIME-1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Nikita Khrushchev, ''Time'' Magazine's [[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1957]]\nIn 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, the proceedings of the Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=198\u201399}}\n\nIn 1962, Khrushchev divided ''[[oblast]]'' level Party committees (''[[obkom]]s'') into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. This was unpopular among Party ''[[apparatchik]]s'', and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each ''oblast'', the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=154\u201357}} Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee,{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=153}} and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}\n\n==== Agricultural policy ====\nSince the 1940s, Khrushchev had advocated the cultivation of corn ([[maize]]) in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=374}} He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the [[Virgin Lands Campaign|Virgin Lands]].{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=205}} In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an [[Iowa]]-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. While their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman [[Roswell Garst]], who persuaded him to insist on visiting [[Roswell and Elizabeth Garst Farmstead Historic District|Garst's large farm]].<ref>Stephen J. Frese, \"Comrade Khrushchev and Farmer Garst: East-West Encounters Foster Agricultural Exchange.\" ''The History Teacher'' 38#1 (2004), pp. 37\u201365. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1555626 online].</ref> The Iowan visited the Soviet Union in September, where he became great friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR {{convert|5000|ST|MT}} of seed corn.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|pp=205\u201306}} Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}} This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. While Khrushchev warned against those who \"would have us plant the whole planet with corn\", he displayed a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visited a Latvian ''kolkhoz'', he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, \"Will Khrushchev say something about corn or won't he?\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}} He did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}} The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and \"as a result corn was discredited as a [[silage]] crop\u2014and so was I\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}}\n\nKhrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines such as combines and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the ''kolkhozes'' and ''sovkhozes'' (state farms).{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=85}} After a successful test involving MTS which served one large ''kolkhoz'' each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition\u2014but then ordered that the change take place with great speed.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=86\u201387}} Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and ''kolkhozes'' were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=87\u201389}} MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to ''kolkhozes'' and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=89\u201391}} The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many ''kolkhozes''. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=92\u201393}} Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the ''kolkhozes'' now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nOne adviser to Khrushchev was [[Trofim Lysenko]], who promised greatly increased production with minimal investment. Such schemes were attractive to Khrushchev, who ordered them implemented. Lysenko managed to maintain his influence under Khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. Lysenko's influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=216}} In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials, with Khrushchev's encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=214\u201315}}\n\nIn June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter (by 25\u201330%). This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of [[Novocherkassk]] ([[Rostov Region]]), this discontent escalated to a strike and a [[Novocherkassk riots|revolt]] against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military. According to Soviet official accounts, 22 people were killed and 87 wounded. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through [[Samizdat]] and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=519\u2013523}}\n\nDrought struck the Soviet Union in 1963; the harvest of {{convert|107500000|ST|MT}} of grain was down from a peak of {{convert|134700000|ST|MT}} in 1958.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=607}} The shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from Khrushchev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=607}} Reluctant to purchase food in the West,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=607}} but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, Khrushchev exhausted the nation's hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=160\u201361}}\n\n====Education====\n[[File:RIAN archive 159271 Nikita Khrushchev, Valentina Tereshkova, Pavel Popovich and Yury Gagarin at Lenin Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Khrushchev (right) with cosmonauts [[Yuri Gagarin]], [[Pavel Popovich]] and [[Valentina Tereshkova]], 1963]]\nWhile visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was greatly impressed by the agricultural education program at [[Iowa State University]], and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=221}} Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, \"It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the [[Russian State Agricultural University|Timiryazev Agricultural Academy]]. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they'd have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2007|p=154}}\n\nKhrushchev founded several academic towns, such as [[Akademgorodok]]. The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as [[Oxford]], isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centres tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=108}}\n\nKhrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools. While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would spend much of their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=192\u201393}} In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=193}}\n\nWhile the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for gifted students or those wishing to study a specific subject.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|p=147}} These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949.{{sfn|Laurent|2009}} In 1962, a special summer school was established in [[Novosibirsk]] to prepare students for a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|p=147}} Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, and by the time he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool\u2014about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.{{sfn|Perrie|2006|p=488}}\n\n===Anti-religious campaign===\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the [[21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|21st Party Congress]] in the same year.

According to [[Dimitry Pospielovsky]], the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences on clergymen for \"trumped up charges\", but he writes that it was in reality for resisting the closure of churches and for giving sermons attacking atheism or the anti-religious campaign, or who conducted Christian charity or who made religion popular by personal example.{{sfn|Pospielovsky|1987|p=84}}\n\n===Foreign and defense policies===\n[[File:Tage Erlander and Nikita Khrushchev 1964.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Khrushchev (rowing the boat) with the Swedish Prime Minister [[Tage Erlander]], 1964]]\nWhen Khrushchev took control, the outside world still knew little of him, and initially was not impressed by him.

In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union. If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany. This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=195}} This ultimatum caused dissent among the Western Allies, who were reluctant to go to war over the issue.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=196}} Khrushchev, however, repeatedly extended the deadline.\n\nKhrushchev sought to sharply reduce levels of conventional weapons, and to defend the Soviet Union with missiles.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=187}} He believed that without this transition, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=217}} He abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy in 1955, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=127}} In January 1960, he took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=216\u201317}} While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|pp=183\u201384}}\n\nThe Soviets had few operable [[ICBM|intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBM); in spite of this, Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would put psychological pressure on the West resulting in political concessions.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}} The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched [[Sputnik 1]] into orbit, a launch many westerners, including U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], were convinced was a hoax.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}} When it became clear that the launch was real, and Sputnik 1 was in orbit, Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was. Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=187}} For years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=187}} In January 1960 Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because \"main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives\".{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=131}} The United States had learned of the primitive state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}} The general U.S. and public perception of a \"[[missile gap]]\" led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}}\n\nDuring Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union in 1959{{sfn|UPI 1959 Year in Review}} he and Khrushchev took part in what later became known as the [[Kitchen Debate]].

He returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve [[d\u00e9tente]] with the Americans.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=211}} He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=218}}\n\n=====U-2 and Berlin crisis (1960\u20131961)=====\n[[File:Nikita Khrushchev 1960.jpg|thumb|alt=An older man sits among United Nations delegation tables, looking at the camera.|Khrushchev and head of USSR delegation [[:ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0417\u043e\u044f \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430|Zoya Mironova]] at the [[United Nations]], September 1960]]\n\nA constant irritant in Soviet\u2013U.S. relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy aircraft]]. On 9 April 1960, the U.S. resumed such flights after a lengthy break. The Soviets had protested the flights in the past, but had been ignored by Washington. Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights' resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by [[CIA]] Director [[Allen Dulles]] without the U.S. President's knowledge.

Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=219\u201320}} Finally, on 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers' capture, blaming the overflight on \"imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon\", and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower's knowledge.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=223}} Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them \"a distasteful necessity\".{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=224}} The admission stunned Khrushchev, and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S. Ambassador [[Llewellyn Thompson]] for help.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=225}}\n\nKhrushchev was undecided what to do at the summit even as he boarded his flight to Paris. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=225}} Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the [[1960 United States presidential election]]. The U.S. President offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his [[Treaty on Open Skies|Open Skies]] proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=219\u201320}} Eisenhower accused Khrushchev \"of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested\".{{sfn|UPI 1960 Year in Review}} Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. President could enjoy his favourite sport,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=441}} was cancelled by Khrushchev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=469}}\n\nKhrushchev made his second and final visit to the United States in September 1960.

The notorious [[shoe-banging incident]] occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the [[Philippines|Filipino]] delegate [[Lorenzo Sumulong]] charging the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused Sumulong of being \"a fawning lackey of the American imperialists\". Sumulong resumed his speech and accused the Soviets of hypocrisy. Khrushchev yanked off his shoe and began banging it on his desk.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|pp=284\u201386}} This behavior by Khrushchev scandalized his delegation.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=139}}\n\n[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A younger man and an older one confer together.|Khrushchev and [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Vienna]], June 1961]]\n\nKhrushchev considered U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner, and was delighted by his defeat in the 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[John F. Kennedy]], as a far more likely partner for d\u00e9tente, but was taken aback by the newly inaugurated U.S. President's tough talk and actions in the early days of his administration.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=232}} Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with [[Vostok 1|the first manned spaceflight]], while Kennedy suffered a defeat with the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]. While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the [[Vienna summit]] scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy, on the other hand, had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of East\u2013West tensions. Kennedy described negotiating with Khrushchev to [[Robert Kennedy|his brother Robert]] as \"like dealing [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|with Dad]]. All give and no take.\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=233\u201335}}\n\n[[File:Soviet empire 1960.png|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] [[Sphere of influence|influence]], after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959 and before the official [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1961]]\n\nAn indefinite postponement of action over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev, if for no other reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous \"brain drain\" as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While the [[Inner German Border|boundary between the two German states]] had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow [[Charles E. Bohlen]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] Chairman [[J. William Fulbright]] that East Germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader [[Walter Ulbricht]] to begin construction of what became known as the [[Berlin Wall]], which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=235\u201336}} [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|That treaty]] would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to [[German reunification]].\n\n===== Cuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962\u20131964) =====\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about {{convert|90|mi}} from the U.S. coast.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Cuban Prime Minister [[Fidel Castro]] was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, \"We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. We were not violating international law. Why do it secretly\u2014as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=248}}\n\nOn 16 October, Kennedy was informed that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=465\u201366}} On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack\u2014except atomic weapons.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=469\u201372}}\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances, and went to the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] to hear American opera singer [[Jerome Hines]], who was then performing in Moscow.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}{{sfn|''Life'', 1962-11-09}} By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Two days later, he offered Kennedy terms for the withdrawal.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=145}} Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey, near the Soviet heartland.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=575}} As the last term was not publicly announced at the request of the U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971,{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets, and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of any invasion of Cuba,{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=148}} and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=579}}\n\nAfter the crisis, superpower relations improved, as Kennedy gave [[American University speech|a conciliatory speech]] at [[American University]] on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements.{{sfn|Kennedy|1963}} Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and, in July, negotiated a [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|test ban treaty]] with U.S. negotiator [[Averell Harriman]] and with [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]] of the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=602}} Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's [[Assassination of John F.

The new U.S. President, [[Lyndon Johnson]], hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=604\u201305}}\n\n====Eastern Europe====\n[[File:Gheorghiu-Dej & Khrushchev at Bucharest's Baneasa Airport (June 1960).jpg|thumb|[[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] and Khrushchev at Bucharest's [[B\u0103neasa Airport]] in June 1960.

In Poland, a worker's strike in [[Pozna\u0144]] [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|developed into disturbances]] which left more than 50 dead in October 1956.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=166\u201368}} When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw. While the Soviets were refused entry to the Polish Central Committee plenum where the election was taking place, they met with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=166\u201368}}\n\nThe Polish settlement emboldened the Hungarians, who decided that Moscow could be defied.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=122}} A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October turned into [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|a popular uprising]]. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist [[Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Hungary|Premier]] [[Imre Nagy]].{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=168\u201370}} Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=123\u201324}} Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=125}} On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the [[Suez crisis]], which distracted world attention.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=168\u201370}}\n\nIn the aftermath of these crises, Khrushchev made the statement for which he became well-remembered, \"[[We will bury you]]\" (in Russian, \"\u041c\u044b \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c!\" (''My vas pokhoronim!'')). While many in the West took this statement as a literal threat, Khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the West.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=427\u201328}} When questioned about the statement during his 1959 U.S. visit, Khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism and \"bury\" it.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=96}}\n\nKhrushchev greatly improved relations with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which had been entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader [[Josip Tito]]. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did everything he could to make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the [[Informbiro]] period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=145\u201347}} During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=169}} Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}}\n\n====China====\n[[File:Mao Ts\u00e9-toung, portrait en buste, assis, faisant face \u00e0 Nikita Khrouchtchev, pendant la visite du chef russe 1958 \u00e0 P\u00e9kin.jpg|thumb|alt=A balding man and a younger Chinese man sit and smile, the balding man holding a fan|Khrushchev with [[Mao Zedong]], 1958]]\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} As Khrushchev took control of the USSR, he increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=336}} This assistance was described by historian [[William C. Kirby]] as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=337}} The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=111}} On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] and [[Dalian]] to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery as they departed.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=336\u201337}}\n\nMao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's attempts to reach a ''rapprochement'' with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist-bloc countries.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}\n\nRelations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=338}} Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=136}} When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=391}} Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at d\u00e9tente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]], describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as \"batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. Don't you see how wonderful they are?\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=392}}\n\nThe Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb complete with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=137}} When Khrushchev paid a visit to China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=394}} Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader [[Peng Zhen]] mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=470\u201371}}\n\n==Removal==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] -->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-49000-0329, Berlin, Chruschtschow tr\u00e4gt sich ins Goldene Buch ein.jpg|thumb|Nikita Khrushchev with [[Anastas Mikoyan]] (far right) in Berlin]]\n[[File:1964-10-15 Khrushchev Resigns.ogv|thumb|[[Universal Newsreel]] about Khrushchev's resignation]]\n\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and nominal head of state [[Leonid Brezhnev]] began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the Committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=617}}\n\nThe conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier [[Alexander Shelepin]], and KGB Chairman [[Vladimir Semichastny]], struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at [[Pitsunda]], [[Abkhaz ASSR]] with his close ally [[Anastas Mikoyan]]. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on the subject of agriculture.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=5}} Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=6}} he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General [[Aleksi Inauri]], but otherwise taking no precautions.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nKhrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of [[Vnukovo Airport]]; KGB Chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB security guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/478480 \"Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny, spy chief, died on January 12th, aged 77\"].

However, the security agency made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes, which he refused to do.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=280}}\nWhile Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/44919697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''Chruschtschows letzter Kampfd'']</ref> Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher.

Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=280\u201381}} Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, ''[[Izvestia]]'' denounced them as a fraud.{{sfn|Shabad|1970}} Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, and it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} In the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', Khrushchev was given a short characterization: \"In his activities, there were elements of [[subjectivism]] and [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]]\".\n\nIn his final days, Khrushchev visited his son-in-law and former aide [[Alexei Adzhubei]] (1924\u20131993<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alexei-adzhubei-1499406.html ''Obituary: Alexei Adzhubei'']</ref>) and told him, \"Never regret that you lived in stormy times and worked with me in the Central Committee. We will yet be remembered!\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=281}}\n\n==Death==\nKhrushchev died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in a hospital near his home in Moscow on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a [[state funeral]] with interment in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis|Kremlin Wall]] and was instead buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=282\u201383}}\n\n''Pravda'' ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=299}} Veteran ''New York Times'' Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, \"Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1971}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:DestroyKhrusch.JPG|thumb|alt=The remains of a low rise building are seen between two high rises|A ''[[khrushchyovka]]'' is destroyed, Moscow, January 2008]]\n\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180\u201382}}\n\nHistorian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] summarizes Khrushchev's contradictory personality traits. According to him, Khrushchev was:\n\n<blockquote>at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.<ref>Service, Robert (1997) ''A History of Twentieth-Century Russia''. Harvard UP. p. 375. {{ISBN|9780713991482}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome of Khrushchev's agricultural projects were also easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period, as even ''kolkhozes'' which had been successful with it in Ukraine and other southern portions of the USSR refused to plant it.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=128}} [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]] was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180\u201382}} While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev's fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=185}} Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev's precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180\u201382}} Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power to assure its continuation. The KGB and Red Army were given increasing powers. The government's conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=184}}\n\n[[File:The transfer of Crimea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet \"On the transfer of the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Oblast]]\". Khrushchev transferred Crimea from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]].]]\n\nThough Khrushchev's strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=544}}\n\nThe Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians evaluate positively are those under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], and under Khrushchev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} A poll in 2003 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good\u2014except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} Subsequent polls, however, have found Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev the most popular Russian leaders of the century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/brezhnev-stalin-gorbachev-soviet-638/|title=Russians name Brezhnev best 20th-century leader, Gorbachev worst|work=RT International|date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier's reforms to those which occurred later:\n\n<blockquote>\nThroughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=283\u201384}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==Media portrayals==\n* Russian actor [[Rolan Bykov]] portrayed Khushchev in the 1993 Russian film ''[[The Gray Wolves]] ( Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0438 ), which focuses on the displacement of Khrushchev by Brezhnev.\n* British actor [[Bob Hoskins]] portrayed Khrushchev in the 2001 film ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]'', directed by [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] and co-written by Annaud and [[Alain Godard]]. It was based on William Craig's 1973 book ''[[Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad]]''.\n* American actor [[Steve Buscemi]] played Khrushchev in the 2017 satirical film ''[[The Death of Stalin]]'', directed and co-written by [[Armando Iannucci]].

[[Politician|statesman]] who led the Soviet Union during part of the [[Cold War]] as the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|first secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1953 to 1964 and as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]] (or premier) from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was responsible for the [[de-Stalinization]] of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early [[Soviet space program]], and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as Premier.\n\nKhrushchev was born in 1894 in the village of [[Kalinovka, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Kalinovka]], close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was employed as a [[metal worker]] during his youth, and he was a [[political commissar]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. With the help of [[Lazar Kaganovich]], he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purges]], and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the [[Ukrainian SSR]], and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]] ([[Eastern Front of World War II]]), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody [[defense of Stalingrad]], a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.\n\nOn 5 March 1953, Stalin\u2019s death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary. On 25 February 1956, at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]], he delivered the \"[[Secret Speech]]\", which denounced [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Stalin's purges]] and ushered in [[Khrushchev Thaw|a less repressive era]] in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite the cuts, Khrushchev's rule saw the most tense years of the Cold War, culminating in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\nKhrushchev's popularity was eroded by flaws in his policies. This emboldened his potential opponents, who quietly rose in strength and deposed the Premier in October 1964. However, he did not suffer the deadly fate of previous Soviet power struggles, and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a ''[[dacha]]'' in the countryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970. Khrushchev died in 1971 of a [[heart attack]].\n\n== Early years ==\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?168865-1/khrushchev-man-era-part-1 Part One of ''Booknotes'' interview with William Taubman on ''Khrushchev: The Man and His Era'', 20 April 2003], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?168865-2/khrushchev-man-era-part-2 Part Two of ''Booknotes'' interview with Taubman, 27 April 2003], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nKhrushchev was born on 15 April 1894,{{efn|name=birth}}{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=2}} in [[Kalinovka, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Oblast|Kalinovka]],{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=20}} a village in what is now Russia's [[Kursk Oblast]], near the present Ukrainian border.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=18}} His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Xeniya Khrushcheva, were poor peasants of Russian{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=18}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/02/27/283481587/crimea-a-gift-to-ukraine-becomes-a-political-flash-point|title=Crimea: A Gift To Ukraine Becomes A Political Flash Point|date=27 February 2014|work=NPR.org}}</ref> origin, and had a daughter two years Nikita's junior, Irina.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=2}} Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the [[Donbas]] area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and labouring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nKalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=27}} Nikita worked as a [[Herder|herdsboy]] from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a [[Freethought|freethinker]] who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}} She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=26}}\n\nIn 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of [[Donetsk|Yuzovka]] (now Donetsk, [[Ukraine]]); fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and [[Donetsk]] in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=30}} After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=6\u20137}} He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the [[Lena Goldfields Massacre]], and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=37\u201338}} where his father was the union organiser, and he helped distribute copies and organise public readings of ''[[Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=8}} He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=141}}\n[[File:1916. Khrushhev-s-zhenojj-efrosinejj.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Khrushchev and his first wife Euphrasinia (Yefrosinia) in 1916]]\nWhen [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from [[conscription]] because he was a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=8\u20139}} In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nAfter the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] in 1917, the new [[Russian Provisional Government]] in [[Petrograd]] had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or ''soviet'') in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=47}} He did not join the [[Bolshevik]]s until 1918, a year in which the [[Russian Civil War]], between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the [[White Movement|White Army]], began in earnest. His biographer, [[William Taubman]], suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the [[Menshevik]]s who prioritised economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47\u201348}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nIn March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|a separate peace]] with the [[Central Powers]], [[Ukrainian War of Independence#German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918|the Germans occupied the Donbas]] and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the [[Red Army]] as a [[political commissar]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=48\u201349}} The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=12}} though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}} In 1921, [[Russian Civil War|the civil war]] ended, and Khrushchev was demobilised and assigned as commissar to a labour brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}\n\nThe wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of [[typhus]] in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|Bolshevik principles]], refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=50}}\n\n== Party official ==\n=== Donbas years ===\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=52}} While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mineowners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n[[File:NikitaNina.JPG|thumb|Khrushchev's second wife (though they were never officially married) was Ukrainian-born [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], whom he met in 1922]]\nKhrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to [[Donetsk National Technical University|the newly established technical college]] (''tekhnikum'') in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (''[[rabfak]]'') attached to the ''tekhnikum'' that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the ''tekhnikum''.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} While enrolled in the ''[[rabfak]]'', Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=14}} One of his teachers later described him as a poor student.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=55}} He was more successful in advancing in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]; soon after his admission to the ''rabfak'' in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire ''tekhnikum'', and became a member of the bureau\u2014the governing council\u2014of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of [[Leon Trotsky]] against those of [[Joseph Stalin]] over the question of party democracy.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56\u201357}} All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his ''rabfak'' studies, it is unclear whether this was true.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nKhrushchev's studies were aided by [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk]], a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants, according to some sources.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=58\u201359}} The family was poor, according to Nina's own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.\n\nIn mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky ''[[raikom]]'', or district, near Stalino. The ''[[raikom]]'' was about {{convert|400|sqmi|km2}} in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=16\u201317}} In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the [[14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b)|14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party]] in Moscow.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=63}}\n\n=== Kaganovich prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[NKVD]] chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]], 1935.

In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64\u201366}} and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage,{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of the Stalino party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=64\u201366}} Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to [[Kharkov]], then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=66}} In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to [[Kiev]], where he served as second-in-command of the Party organization there.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=68}}\n\nIn 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the [[Kremlin]] as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the [[Industrial Academy (Moscow)|Stalin Industrial Academy]]. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} When the school's Party cell elected a number of [[rightists]] to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in ''[[Pravda]]''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31\u201332}} Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=31\u201332}} Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the [[Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow city Party organization]], and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}} and a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party's Central Committee]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=78}} Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student [[Nadezhda Alliluyeva]], Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nWhile head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended construction of the [[Moscow Metro]], a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the [[Order of Lenin]] for his role in its construction.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=94\u201395}} Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the [[Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow Regional Committee]] which was responsible for [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow ''oblast'']], a province with a population of 11&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=73}}\n\n=== Involvement in purges ===\n[[File:Khrushchyov, Beria and Khanjian.jpg|thumb| [[Nestor Lakoba]], Khrushchev, [[Lavrenti Beria]] and [[Aghasi Khanjian]] during opening of the [[Moscow Metro]] in 1936.]]\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's ''dacha'', while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=105\u201306}}\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0426\u0418\u041a \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420.jpg|thumb|right|Khrushchev (sitting first from left), head of Moscow party branch, with various regional party leaders in 1935. Standing first from right is [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]]]]\nBeginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the [[Great Purge]], during which millions of people were executed or sent to the [[Gulag]]. Central to this campaign were the [[Moscow Trials]], a series of [[show trial]]s of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\n\n<blockquote>\nEveryone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-[[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinovievite]] gang. That word is execution.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=98}}\n</blockquote>\n\nKhrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow ''oblast''.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} Of 38&nbsp;top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}}\u2014the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=57}} Of the 146&nbsp;Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=99}} In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=99\u2013100}} By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}\n\nParty leaders were given numerical quotas of \"enemies\" to be turned in and arrested.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}} In June 1937, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] set a quota of 35,000&nbsp;enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000&nbsp;wealthy peasants, or ''[[kulak]]s'' living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305&nbsp;\"criminal and ''kulak'' elements\" had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=100}}\n\nKhrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, \"blanched\" (for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=103\u201304}} Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an [[enemy of the people]] then and there.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=104}} Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=69}}\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhDPL92SOY Khrushchev speech in 1937]}}\nIn late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party in Ukraine]], and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=114\u201315}} Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=116}} All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=60}}\n\nBiographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}} In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying \"Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=118}}\n\n== World War II ==\n=== Occupation of Polish territory ===\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded the eastern portion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the [[Western Ukraine|western portion of Ukraine]]. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories  would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|USSR Supreme Soviet]], and Western Ukraine became a part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Ukrainian SSR) on 1 November 1939.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=135\u201337}} Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with [[Eastern Ukraine|Eastern Ukrainians]], and giving confiscated land to collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]es'') rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=72}}\n\n=== War against Germany ===\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi Germany invaded the USSR]], in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=149}} Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=150}} As the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military in an attempt to defend and save Kiev. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|encircled by the Germans]]. While the Germans stated they took 655,000&nbsp;prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541&nbsp;men out of 677,085 escaped the trap.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=163}} Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement at this point. According to Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Georgi Zhukov]], writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=162\u201364}} However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]] proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|p=347}} Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:\n\n{{quote|But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished&nbsp;... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy.&nbsp;... There you have the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result we simply lost them.&nbsp;... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2004|pp=349\u201350}}}}\n\nIn 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the [[Kharkov]] area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000&nbsp;Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to [[Second Battle of Kharkov|attack at Kharkov]], and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000&nbsp;soldiers, including more than 200,000&nbsp;men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to [[Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=164\u201368}}\n\n[[File:RIAN archive 882837 The defenders of Stalingrad.jpg|thumb|left|Khrushchev (left) on the Stalingrad Front]]\nKhrushchev reached the [[Stalingrad Front]] in August 1942, soon after the start of [[Battle of Stalingrad|the battle for the city]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168\u201371}} His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major\u2014General [[Vasily Chuikov]], who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier\u2014but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=81}} Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a [[counterattack]], only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned [[Operation Uranus]], a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before ''Uranus'' was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=168\u201371}}\n\nSoon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son [[Leonid Khrushchev|Leonid]], a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial,{{sfn|Birch|2008}} as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate has been the subject of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life.{{sfn|Birch|2008}} This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech.{{sfn|Birch|2008}}{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=157\u201358}} While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=82}} In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=158}} In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=158\u201362}}\n\nAfter ''Uranus'' forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served in other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the [[Battle of Kursk]], in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=171\u201372}} Khrushchev related that he interrogated an [[SS]] defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack\u2014a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as \"almost certainly exaggerated\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177\u201378}} He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=177\u201378}} As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nAccording to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era were generally favorable, at a time when it was \"barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context\".{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}} Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=73}}\n\n== Rise to power ==\n=== Return to Ukraine ===\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=179}}\n\nKhrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine, but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=180}} As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000&nbsp;men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=181}} Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=193\u201395}} Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}}\n\nIn an effort to increase agricultural production, the ''[[kolkhoz]]es'' (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. ''Kolkhoz'' leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly 12,000&nbsp;people were sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=86}} He also worked to impose [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=87\u201388}} The partisans, many of whom fought as the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 \"bandits\" and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}} About 600,000&nbsp;Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=195}}\n\nThe war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} The [[Soviet government]] sought to collect as much grain as possible in order to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=199}} Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=199\u2013200}} Food was rationed\u2014but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions, and was little noticed outside the USSR.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=91}} Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free [[soup kitchen]]s.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=200\u2013201}} However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to \"help\" Khrushchev.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=92}} The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}}\n\nSoon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}} However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in [[Latvia]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=203}} Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet [[Kaliningrad]], where he toured factories and quarries.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=27}} By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favour of [[Demyan Korotchenko]], Khrushchev's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=93}}\n\nKhrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=95}} Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=205}} Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=96}} With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a \"rural proletariat\", Khrushchev conceived the idea of the \"agro-town\".{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96\u201397}} Rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nIn his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine, where he governed for over a decade:\n\n<blockquote>\nI'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction&nbsp;... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts&nbsp;... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=16\u201317}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Stalin's final years ===\nKhrushchev attributed his recall to [[Moscow]] to mental disorder on the part of [[Stalin]], who feared conspiracies in Moscow matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated [[Leningrad case]], in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=18\u201322}} Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of [[Georgy Malenkov]] and security chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=210}}\n\nAt this time, the ageing leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin. These sessions, which Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], and [[Nikolai Bulganin]], who comprised Stalin's inner circle, attended, began with showings of cowboy movies favoured by Stalin.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211\u201315}} Stolen from the West, they lacked subtitles.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211\u201315}} The dictator had the meal served at around 1&nbsp;a.m., and insisted that his subordinates stay with him and drink until dawn. On one occasion, Stalin had Khrushchev, then aged almost sixty, dance [[hopak|a traditional Ukrainian dance]]. Khrushchev did so, later stating, \"When Stalin says dance, a wise man dances.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=211\u201315}} Khrushchev attempted to nap at lunch so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=43}}\n\nIn 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. A large part of the housing was in the form of five- or six-story apartment buildings, which became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union; many remain in use today.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=99}} Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=226}} These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946\u20131950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed ''[[Khrushchyovka]]'' by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called ''Khrushchoba'' as a [[portmanteau]] combining Khrushchev's name with the Russian word ''trushchoba'', meaning \"slum\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Vocabulary of Soviet Society and Culture: A Selected Guide to Russian Words, Idioms, and Expressions of the Post-Stalin Era, 1953\u20131991 |author=Irina H.

This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=100\u201301}} Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in ''[[Pravda]]'' in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=228\u201330}}\n\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin suffered a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep. Stalin had left orders not to be disturbed, and it was twelve hours until his condition was discovered. Even as terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=236\u201341}}\n\nKhrushchev reflected on Stalin in his memoirs:\n\n<blockquote>\nStalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an \"enemy of the people.\" He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, \"the enemies of the people\" had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal&nbsp;... <nowiki>[P]</nowiki>eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never!&nbsp;{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|pp=167\u201368}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Struggle for control ===\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] as [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|first vice-chairmen]]. [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin#Funeral service|Stalin's funeral]] was conducted on 9 March. Those members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee]] who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=114}} ''The New York Times'' listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium\u2014and Khrushchev last.{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1953-03-10}}\n\nHowever, on 14 March, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries\u2014indicating that he was now in charge of the party.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614785/Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"] at ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''</ref> The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=258}}\n\nEven before Stalin had been laid to rest, Beria launched a lengthy series of reforms which rivalled those of Khrushchev during his period of power and even those of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] a third of a century later.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} Beria's proposals were designed to denigrate Stalin and pass the blame for Beria's own crimes to the late leader.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=245}} One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million prisoners.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=246}} Another, which was not adopted, was to release [[East Germany]] into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=247}}\u2014a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist.{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=184}} Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup,{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=121}} and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that \"Beria is getting his knives ready for us.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=186}} The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria's most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard.<ref>Timothy K.  Blauvelt, \"Patronage and betrayal in the post-Stalin succession: The case of Kruglov and Serov\" ''Communist & Post-Communist Studies'' (2008) 43#1 pp 105\u201320.</ref> On 26 June 1953 Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret, and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates. The execution of Beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top-level Soviet power struggle paid with his life.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=123}}\n\nThe power struggle in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=125\u201326}} Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}}\n\nKhrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=259}} Khrushchev arranged for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] grounds to be opened to the public, an act with \"great public resonance\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=263}} While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader, and included the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]], under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern [[Kazakhstan]]. While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture, it was initially successful.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=174}} In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the [[KGB]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=260\u2013264}}\n\nAt a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the [[Leningrad affair|Leningrad case]], and of facilitating Beria's climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial [[Supreme Soviet]] the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favour of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=15\u201317}} Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, \"Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the [[collective leadership]] was now beyond any reasonable doubt.\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=141\u201342}}\n\nThe post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign-policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by the European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts, and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality\u2014he remained unpredictable, and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev's policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik, but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.<ref>Paul  Marantz, \"Internal Politics and Soviet Foreign Policy: A Case Study.\" ''Western Political Quarterly'' 28.1 (1975): 130\u201346.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/447860 online]</ref>\n\n== Leader (1953\u20131964) ==\n=== Domestic policies ===\n\n==== Consolidation of power; Secret Speech ====\n{{main|Secret Speech}}\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=266}} However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=266\u201367}} The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=27}} Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=268\u201369}}\n\nBy the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the [[gulag|gulag labor camps]].{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=275}} Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=276}} Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|20th Party Congress]] about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279\u201380}}\n\nThe 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with [[Klement Gottwald]] and the little-known [[Kyuichi Tokuda]].{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=153}} In the early morning hours of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the \"[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]\" to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the \"congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2006|p=212}} Khrushchev told the delegates:\n\n{{quote|It is here that Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power&nbsp;... he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies, but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the Soviet Government.{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 1956-05-06}}}}\n\nThe Secret Speech, while it did not fundamentally change Soviet society, had wide-ranging effects. The speech was a factor in [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|unrest in Poland]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|revolution in Hungary]] later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led [[1956 Georgian demonstrations|four days of rioting]] in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=286\u201391}} In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], then a [[Komsomol]] official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=286\u201391}} Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be \"a moral man after all\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=282}}\n\nThe term \"Secret Speech\" proved to be an utter misnomer. While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked \"not for the press\" rather than \"top secret\". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=279\u201380}} Khrushchev's son, [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]], later wrote, \"<nowiki>[C]</nowiki>learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech&nbsp;... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2000|p=200}}\n\nThe anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through [[List of Ministers of Defense of the Soviet Union|Minister of Defense]] Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the [[Anti-Party Group]], accused of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client [[Dmitri Shepilov]] who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to [[Mongolia]]; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=176\u201383}}\n\nMarshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=361\u201364}} Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the ''[[Gosbank]]'') and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}} Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}}\n\n====Liberalization and the arts====\n{{main|Khrushchev Thaw}}\n[[File:Dwight Eisenhower Nikita Khrushchev and their wives at state dinner 1959.png|thumb|[[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva|Nina Khrushcheva]], [[Mamie Eisenhower]], Khrushchev, and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] at a [[state dinner]] in 1959]]\n[[File:Khrushchev family at the Waldorf-Astoria 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Khrushchev, his wife, his son [[Sergei Khrushchev|Sergei]] (far right) and his daughter [[:ru:\u0410\u0434\u0436\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0439, \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430|Rada]] during their trip to USA in 1959]]\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. [[Vladimir Dudintsev]]'s ''[[Not by Bread Alone]]'',{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=307}} about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=308}} In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on [[Boris Pasternak]] after his novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). ''Pravda'' described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=385}} Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], but under heavy pressure he declined it. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=385}} After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read it myself. There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=628}}\n\nKhrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DkdGcjM7tQ Khrushchev speech, Los Angeles, 19 September 1959]. Youtube</ref> and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=175}} Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=172}} Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over two million Soviet citizens travelled abroad between 1957 and 1961, 700,000 of whom visited the West) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=172}} In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students]] to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed [[Komsomol]] officials to \"smother foreign guests in our embrace\".{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=174}} The resulting \"socialist carnival\" involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|pp=174\u201375}} According to historian [[Vladislav Zubok]], the festival \"shattered propagandist clich\u00e9s\" about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=175}}\n\nIn 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'', persuaded the Presidium to allow publication.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=525\u201328}} That renewed thaw ended on 1 December 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the [[Manezh Gallery]] to view an exhibit which included a number of [[avant-garde]] works. On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]], describing the artwork as \"dog shit\",{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=257\u201360}} and proclaiming that \"a donkey could smear better art with its tail\".{{sfn|Neizvestny|1979}} A week later, ''Pravda'' issued a call for artistic purity. When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them. However, despite the premier's rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open for some time after Khrushchev's visit, and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in ''Pravda''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=257\u201360}}\n\n==== Political reform ====\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. These tribunals (known as ''[[NKVD troika|troikas]]''), had often ignored laws and procedures. Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee. This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. Instead, other sanctions were imposed on [[Soviet dissidents]], including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party. During Khrushchev's rule, [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|forced hospitalization]] for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=41\u201342}} According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\".{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n[[File:Nikita-Khrushchev-TIME-1958.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Nikita Khrushchev, ''Time'' Magazine's [[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1957]]\nIn 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, the proceedings of the Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=198\u201399}}\n\nIn 1962, Khrushchev divided ''[[oblast]]'' level Party committees (''[[obkom]]s'') into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. This was unpopular among Party ''[[apparatchik]]s'', and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each ''oblast'', the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=154\u201357}} Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee,{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=153}} and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}\n\n==== Agricultural policy ====\nSince the 1940s, Khrushchev had advocated the cultivation of corn ([[maize]]) in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=374}} He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of acres to be planted with corn in the [[Virgin Lands Campaign|Virgin Lands]].{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=205}} In February 1955, Khrushchev gave a speech in which he advocated an [[Iowa]]-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. While their intent was to visit only small farms, the delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn salesman [[Roswell Garst]], who persuaded him to insist on visiting [[Roswell and Elizabeth Garst Farmstead Historic District|Garst's large farm]].<ref>Stephen J. Frese, \"Comrade Khrushchev and Farmer Garst: East-West Encounters Foster Agricultural Exchange.\" ''The History Teacher'' 38#1 (2004), pp. 37\u201365. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1555626 online].</ref> The Iowan visited the Soviet Union in September, where he became great friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR {{convert|5000|ST|MT}} of seed corn.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|pp=205\u201306}} Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country, and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}} This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. While Khrushchev warned against those who \"would have us plant the whole planet with corn\", he displayed a great passion for corn, so much so that when he visited a Latvian ''kolkhoz'', he stated that some in his audience were probably wondering, \"Will Khrushchev say something about corn or won't he?\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}} He did, rebuking the farmers for not planting more corn.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}} The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later wrote that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and \"as a result corn was discredited as a [[silage]] crop\u2014and so was I\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=373}}\n\nKhrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines such as combines and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the ''kolkhozes'' and ''sovkhozes'' (state farms).{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=85}} After a successful test involving MTS which served one large ''kolkhoz'' each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition\u2014but then ordered that the change take place with great speed.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=86\u201387}} Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and ''kolkhozes'' were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=87\u201389}} MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to ''kolkhozes'' and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=89\u201391}} The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many ''kolkhozes''. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=92\u201393}} Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the ''kolkhozes'' now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nOne adviser to Khrushchev was [[Trofim Lysenko]], who promised greatly increased production with minimal investment. Such schemes were attractive to Khrushchev, who ordered them implemented. Lysenko managed to maintain his influence under Khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. Lysenko's influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=216}} In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials, with Khrushchev's encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=214\u201315}}\n\nIn June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter (by 25\u201330%). This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of [[Novocherkassk]] ([[Rostov Region]]), this discontent escalated to a strike and a [[Novocherkassk riots|revolt]] against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military. According to Soviet official accounts, 22 people were killed and 87 wounded. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed.

At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=221}} Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, \"It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the [[Russian State Agricultural University|Timiryazev Agricultural Academy]]. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they'd have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks.\"{{sfn|Khrushchev|2007|p=154}}\n\nKhrushchev founded several academic towns, such as [[Akademgorodok]]. The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as [[Oxford]], isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centres tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=108}}\n\nKhrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools. While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would spend much of their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=192\u201393}} In practice, what occurred is that schools developed links with nearby enterprises, and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the factories and other works disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=193}}\n\nWhile the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for gifted students or those wishing to study a specific subject.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|p=147}} These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949.{{sfn|Laurent|2009}} In 1962, a special summer school was established in [[Novosibirsk]] to prepare students for a Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|p=147}} Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, and by the time he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool\u2014about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.{{sfn|Perrie|2006|p=488}}\n\n===Anti-religious campaign===\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the [[21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|21st Party Congress]] in the same year.

In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union. If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany. This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=195}} This ultimatum caused dissent among the Western Allies, who were reluctant to go to war over the issue.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=196}} Khrushchev, however, repeatedly extended the deadline.\n\nKhrushchev sought to sharply reduce levels of conventional weapons, and to defend the Soviet Union with missiles.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=187}} He believed that without this transition, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=217}}  He abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy in 1955, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either conventional or nuclear attack.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=127}} In January 1960, he took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=216\u201317}} While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|pp=183\u201384}}\n\nThe Soviets had few operable [[ICBM|intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBM); in spite of this, Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would put psychological pressure on the West resulting in political concessions.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}} The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched [[Sputnik 1]] into orbit, a launch many westerners, including U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], were convinced was a hoax.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}} When it became clear that the launch was real, and Sputnik 1 was in orbit, Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was. Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=187}} For years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=187}}  In January 1960 Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because \"main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives\".{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=131}}  The United States had learned of the primitive state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}}  The general U.S. and public perception of a \"[[missile gap]]\" led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=188}}\n\nDuring Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union in 1959{{sfn|UPI 1959 Year in Review}} he and Khrushchev took part in what later became known as the [[Kitchen Debate]]. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned argument in a model kitchen at the [[American National Exhibition]] in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Khrushchev was invited to visit the United States, and did so, his [[1959 Khrushchev visit to the United States|first visit to the United States]],  arriving in Washington, DC on 15 September 1959 and spending thirteen days in the country.  This first visit by a Soviet premier to the United States resulted in an extended media circus.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=247}} Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=421\u201322}} The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), [[Coon Rapids, Iowa]] (visiting [[Roswell and Elizabeth Garst Farmstead Historic District|Roswell Garst's farm]]), Pittsburgh, and Washington,{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=63}} concluding with a meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower at [[Camp David]].{{sfn|Carlson|2009|pp=226\u201327}} During luncheon at the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host [[Spyros Skouras]] over the respective merits of capitalism and communism.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUQ88MsGVT2GWoHtL3GbYhHnLOe22MPRc Khrushchev speech, 19 September 1959].

He returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve [[d\u00e9tente]] with the Americans.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=211}} He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=218}}\n\n=====U-2 and Berlin crisis (1960\u20131961)=====\n[[File:Nikita Khrushchev 1960.jpg|thumb|alt=An older man sits among United Nations delegation tables, looking at the camera.|Khrushchev and head of USSR delegation [[:ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0417\u043e\u044f \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430|Zoya Mironova]] at the [[United Nations]], September 1960]]\n\nA constant irritant in Soviet\u2013U.S. relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy aircraft]].

He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=225}} Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the [[1960 United States presidential election]]. The U.S. President offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his [[Treaty on Open Skies|Open Skies]] proposal for mutual overflight rights.

The notorious [[shoe-banging incident]] occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the [[Philippines|Filipino]] delegate [[Lorenzo Sumulong]] charging the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused Sumulong of being \"a fawning lackey of the American imperialists\". Sumulong resumed his speech and accused the Soviets of hypocrisy.

He considered the victor, [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[John F.

While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the [[Vienna summit]] scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy, on the other hand, had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of East\u2013West tensions. Kennedy described negotiating with Khrushchev to [[Robert Kennedy|his brother Robert]] as \"like dealing [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|with Dad]].

While the [[Inner German Border|boundary between the two German states]] had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow [[Charles E. Bohlen]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] Chairman [[J. William Fulbright]] that East Germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader [[Walter Ulbricht]] to begin construction of what became known as the [[Berlin Wall]], which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=235\u201336}} [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|That treaty]] would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to [[German reunification]].\n\n===== Cuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962\u20131964) =====\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about {{convert|90|mi}} from the U.S. coast.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} Cuban Prime Minister [[Fidel Castro]] was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret.

I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=248}}\n\nOn 16 October, Kennedy was informed that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=465\u201366}} On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack\u2014except atomic weapons.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=469\u201372}}\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances, and went to the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] to hear American opera singer [[Jerome Hines]], who was then performing in Moscow.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}{{sfn|''Life'', 1962-11-09}} By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba.

In Poland, a worker's strike in [[Pozna\u0144]] [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|developed into disturbances]] which left more than 50 dead in October 1956.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=166\u201368}} When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw. While the Soviets were refused entry to the Polish Central Committee plenum where the election was taking place, they met with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=166\u201368}}\n\nThe Polish settlement emboldened the Hungarians, who decided that Moscow could be defied.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=122}} A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October turned into [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|a popular uprising]]. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist [[Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Hungary|Premier]] [[Imre Nagy]].{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=168\u201370}} Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|pp=123\u201324}} Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=125}} On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the [[Suez crisis]], which distracted world attention.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=168\u201370}}\n\nIn the aftermath of these crises, Khrushchev made the statement for which he became well-remembered, \"[[We will bury you]]\" (in Russian, \"\u041c\u044b \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c!\" (''My vas pokhoronim!'')). While many in the West took this statement as a literal threat, Khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the West.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=427\u201328}} When questioned about the statement during his 1959 U.S. visit, Khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism and \"bury\" it.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=96}}\n\nKhrushchev greatly improved relations with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], which had been entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader [[Josip Tito]]. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did everything he could to make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the [[Informbiro]] period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=145\u201347}} During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=169}} Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=189}}\n\n====China====\n[[File:Mao Ts\u00e9-toung, portrait en buste, assis, faisant face \u00e0 Nikita Khrouchtchev, pendant la visite du chef russe 1958 \u00e0 P\u00e9kin.jpg|thumb|alt=A balding man and a younger Chinese man sit and smile, the balding man holding a fan|Khrushchev with [[Mao Zedong]], 1958]]\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} As Khrushchev took control of the USSR, he increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=336}} This assistance was described by historian [[William C. Kirby]] as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\".{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=337}} The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=111}} On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] and [[Dalian]] to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery as they departed.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=336\u201337}}\n\nMao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's attempts to reach a ''rapprochement'' with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist-bloc countries.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}\n\nRelations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=338}} Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=136}} When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=391}} Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at d\u00e9tente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]], describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as \"batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. Don't you see how wonderful they are?\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=392}}\n\nThe Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb complete with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead.{{sfn|Zubok|2007|p=137}} When Khrushchev paid a visit to China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=394}} Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader [[Peng Zhen]] mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=470\u201371}}\n\n==Removal==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] -->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-49000-0329, Berlin, Chruschtschow tr\u00e4gt sich ins Goldene Buch ein.jpg|thumb|Nikita Khrushchev with [[Anastas Mikoyan]] (far right) in Berlin]]\n[[File:1964-10-15 Khrushchev Resigns.ogv|thumb|[[Universal Newsreel]] about Khrushchev's resignation]]\n\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and nominal head of state [[Leonid Brezhnev]] began discussing Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the Committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=615}} Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy; Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=617}}\n\nThe conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier [[Alexander Shelepin]], and KGB Chairman [[Vladimir Semichastny]], struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at [[Pitsunda]], [[Abkhaz ASSR]] with his close ally [[Anastas Mikoyan]]. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on the subject of agriculture.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=5}} Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting,{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=6}} he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General [[Aleksi Inauri]], but otherwise taking no precautions.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=11\u201313}}\n\nKhrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of [[Vnukovo Airport]]; KGB Chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB security guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/478480 \"Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny, spy chief, died on January 12th, aged 77\"]. ''The Economist'' (18 January 2001)</ref> Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He had no stomach for a fight, and put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup:\n\n{{quote|I didn't even close the Kremlin to visitors. People were strolling around outside, while in the room the Presidium was meeting. I deployed my men around the Kremlin. Everything that was necessary was done. Brezhnev and Shelepin were nervous.

Longman. p. 81. {{ISBN|9780582277762}}</ref>}}\n\nThat night, after his ouster, Khrushchev called his friend and Presidium colleague [[Anastas Mikoyan]], and told him:\n\n{{quote|I'm old and tired. Let them cope by themselves. I've done the main thing. Could anyone have dreamed of telling Stalin that he didn't suit us anymore and suggesting he retire?

I won't put up a fight.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p = 13}}}}\n\nOn 14 October 1964, the Presidium and the Central Committee each voted to accept Khrushchev's \"voluntary\" request to retire from his offices for reasons of \"advanced age and ill health.\" Brezhnev was elected First Secretary (later General Secretary), while [[Alexei Kosygin]] succeeded Khrushchev as premier.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p = 16}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316972/Nikita-Sergeyevich-Khrushchev|title=Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n==Life in retirement==\nKhrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was assured that his house and ''[[dacha]]'' were his for life.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=16\u201317}} Following his removal from power, he fell into deep depression.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=622}} He received few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their comings and goings.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=622\u201323}} In the autumn of 1965, he and his wife were ordered to leave their house and ''dacha'' to move to an apartment and to a smaller ''dacha'' in [[Petrovo-Dalneye]]. His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=278}}{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=623}} The depression continued, and his doctor prescribed sleeping pills and tranquillizers. One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, \"Grandfather cries.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2003|pp=623\u201324}} He was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}}\n\nAs the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, Khrushchev came to be more favourably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. One visitor whom Khrushchev regretted not seeing was former U.S. Vice President Nixon, then in his \"wilderness years\" before his election to the presidency, who went to Khrushchev's Moscow apartment while the former premier was at his ''dacha''.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=279}}\n\nBeginning in 1966, Khrushchev began his memoirs. He dictated them into a tape recorder and recorded indoors, after attempts failed to record outdoors due to background noise, knowing that every word would be heard by the KGB. However, the security agency made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes, which he refused to do.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=280}}\nWhile Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/44919697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''Chruschtschows letzter Kampfd'']</ref> Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title ''Khrushchev Remembers''. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=280\u201381}} Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, ''[[Izvestia]]'' denounced them as a fraud.{{sfn|Shabad|1970}} Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, and it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.{{sfn|Whitman|1971}} In the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', Khrushchev was given a short characterization: \"In his activities, there were elements of [[subjectivism]] and [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism]]\".\n\nIn his final days, Khrushchev visited his son-in-law and former aide [[Alexei Adzhubei]] (1924\u20131993<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alexei-adzhubei-1499406.html ''Obituary: Alexei Adzhubei'']</ref>) and told him, \"Never regret that you lived in stormy times and worked with me in the Central Committee. We will yet be remembered!\"{{sfn|Tompson|1995|p=281}}\n\n==Death==\nKhrushchev died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in a hospital near his home in Moscow on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a [[state funeral]] with interment in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis|Kremlin Wall]] and was instead buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.{{sfn|Tompson|1995|pp=282\u201383}}\n\n''Pravda'' ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage.{{sfn|Carlson|2009|p=299}} Veteran ''New York Times'' Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, \"Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1971}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:DestroyKhrusch.JPG|thumb|alt=The remains of a low rise building are seen between two high rises|A ''[[khrushchyovka]]'' is destroyed, Moscow, January 2008]]\n\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180\u201382}}\n\nHistorian [[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]] summarizes Khrushchev's contradictory personality traits. According to him, Khrushchev was:\n\n<blockquote>at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.<ref>Service, Robert (1997) ''A History of Twentieth-Century Russia''. Harvard UP. p. 375. {{ISBN|9780713991482}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome of Khrushchev's agricultural projects were also easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period, as even ''kolkhozes'' which had been successful with it in Ukraine and other southern portions of the USSR refused to plant it.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=128}} [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]] was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180\u201382}} While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev's fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=185}} Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev's precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|pp=180\u201382}} Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power to assure its continuation. The KGB and Red Army were given increasing powers. The government's conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968.{{sfn|Medvedev|Medvedev|1978|p=184}}\n\n[[File:The transfer of Crimea.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet \"On the transfer of the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Oblast]]\".

The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the [[Helsinki Agreement]] with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.{{sfn|Fursenko|2006|p=544}}\n\nThe Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians evaluate positively are those under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], and under Khrushchev.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} A poll in 2003 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good\u2014except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided.{{sfn|Taubman|2003|p=650}} Subsequent polls, however, have found Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev the most popular Russian leaders of the century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/brezhnev-stalin-gorbachev-soviet-638/|title=Russians name Brezhnev best 20th-century leader, Gorbachev worst|work=RT International|date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier's reforms to those which occurred later:\n\n<blockquote>\nThroughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues.
