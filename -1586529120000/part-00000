He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up in open rebellion]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a disconnect between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander&nbsp;II's successor, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory&nbsp;VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as [[Canossa]] to meet with the Pope. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's conflicts with the Popes and with his sons and wife, and his penitentiary \"Walk to Canossa\" established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, others describing him as an exemplary monarch. \n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as the heads of all Christians and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia. Henry&nbsp;III also outraged the Saxon duke, [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Bernard II]], because he supported the duke's main rival, Archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], to seize Saxon counties.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=41\u201342}} The Salian kings who inherited their [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessors' domains in Saxony visited the province frequently. Their lengthy visits irritated the Saxon aristocrats who were exposed to direct royal control for more time than their peers in other parts of the empire. The Saxons' grievances against the Salian monarchs broke out in a series of revolts during Henry&nbsp;IV's reign.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=94}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on 11 November 1050, Henry was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Henry III, by his second wife, [[Agnes of Poitou]].{{sfn|Hill|2020|p=93}} Henry was most likely born in his father's [[Imperial Palace of Goslar|palace]] at [[Goslar]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} His birth had been long-awaited; Henry III had fathered four daughters, but his subjects were convinced only a male heir could secure the \"peace of kingdom\" (as [[Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne]] called it in a sermon).{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} Henry was first named for his grandfather, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], but Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]], whom Henry&nbsp;III had appointed as his son's [[Godparent|godfather]], convinced the Emperor to give his name to his heir.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} At Christmas 1050 the ailing Henry&nbsp;III designated his infant son as his successor in [[P\u00f6hlde]] (in Saxony).{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}} On this occasion, the Emperor also \"caused many of the princes\"\u2014most probably the Saxon and Thuringian aristocrats\u2014\"to promise an oath of fidelity and submission\" to Henry.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann baptised Henry in [[Cologne]] on Easter day 1051.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} In November, the Emperor held an assembly at [[Tribur]] to secure his son's succession.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} The German princes who attended the meeting elected the one-year-old king. They stipulated they would acknowledge him as his father's successor only if he acted as a \"just ruler\" during his father's lifetime.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} Historian Ian S. Robinson supposes the princes actually wanted to persuade Henry&nbsp;III to change his methods of government since the child king had no role in state administration.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} At Christmas 1052, the Emperor made Henry the duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann crowned Henry king in [[Aachen]] on 17&nbsp;July 1054.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} On this occasion, Henry's two-year-old younger brother, [[Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria|Conrad]], most likely received Bavaria from their father.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} When Conrad died in 1055, the Emperor gave Bavaria to Empress Agnes.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=28, 98}} The Emperor betrothed Henry to [[Bertha of Savoy]] in late 1055.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Her parents, [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide, Margravine of Turin]], and [[Otto, Count of Savoy]], controlled north-western Italy. The Emperor wanted to secure their alliance against the rebellious Godfrey the Bearded.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III fell seriously ill after eating a stag's liver in late September 1056.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Historian Herbert Schutz attributes his sudden illness to his exhaustion.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=138}} Already dying, the Emperor commanded his son to the protection of [[Pope Victor II]] who had come from Italy to Germany.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}} Henry&nbsp;III died on 5&nbsp;October 1056.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}}\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Under guardianship===\n\n[[File:Aachener Dom BW 2016-07-09 13-49-15.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A marble throne|[[Throne of Charlemagne]] in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] in Aachen.]]\n\nAt the age of six, Henry succeeded his father unopposed.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}} Pope Victor&nbsp;II convinced the German aristocrats to swear fealty to their young king and enthroned him in Aachen.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}} He reminded them of their promise to consult Empress Agnes in case her son predeceased her and a successor had to be named.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=141}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=28}} Although she had been planning to enter a [[nunnery]], Agnes was appointed her son's [[Legal guardian|guardian]].{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}} She was responsible for her son's education along with a royal ''[[ministerialis]]'' (or unfree servant), Cuno.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=48}} She secured the most powerful aristocrats' support through lavish grants.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}} Agnes was reconciled with Godfrey the Bearded and made her late husband's other opponent, [[Conrad III, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of the Ezzonen family]], [[duke of Carinthia]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=31}}\n\nAgnes took full control of state administration as [[regent]] after Pope Victor&nbsp;II left Germany early in 1057.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=27}} She paid little attention to Burgundy and Italy,{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=143}} but he insisted on her royal prerogative to appoint bishops and abbots to the vacant German sees and monasteries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} Henry had inherited his father's Roman title of patrician, but the reformist concept of \"liberty of the church\" became dominant in Rome during his minority and his mother could not control papal elections.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Pope Victor's successor, [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen&nbsp;IX]]\u2014Godfrey the Bearded's brother\u2014was elected without royal intervention early in August 1057, because the reformist clerics wanted to prevent their opponents from installing their own candidate as pope.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=37}}\n\nA group of Saxon aristocrats plotted against Henry, fearing he would continue his father's oppressive policies after reaching the age of majority. They convinced [[Otto, Margrave of the Nordmark|Otto of Nordmark]], who had recently returned from exile, to mount a coup. Henry's two relatives, [[Bruno II]] and [[Egbert I, Margrave of Meissen|Egbert&nbsp;I of Brunswick]], attacked the conspirators. Bruno killed Otto but was mortally wounded in the skirmish.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=63}}\n\nAgnes appointed a wealthy aristocrat, Rudolf of Rheinfelden, to be [[duke of Swabia]] in 1057.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}}{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|p=52}} She also charged him with the administration of Burgundy, likely because his extensive Burgundian domains enabled him to pacify the local nobles.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=33\u201334}} Godfrey the Bearded took possession of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[March of Fermo|Fermo]] in the [[Papal States]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=33}} Rumours of Godfrey's determination to seize the imperial crown with Pope Stephen's help spread in Italy, but the Pope died unexpectedly on 29&nbsp;March 1058.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=33}} The Roman aristocrats placed one of their number, [[Antipope Benedict X|Giovanni, Cardinal Bishop of Velletri]], on the papal throne, however, the reformist clerics decided to elect [[Pope Nicholas II|Bishop Gerard of Florence]] pope.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001||pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=33}} They sent an envoy to Germany.

Henry dismissed his retinue, because his son promised a safe conduct to Mainz.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=86}} Instead, he was captured and brought to the castle of [[Waldb\u00f6ckelheim|B\u00f6ckelheim]] {{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=334}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2010|p=176}} where he was also forced to cede the royal insignia to his son.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=86}} The burghers of Mainz remained loyal to Henry so his son summoned the German princes' to an assembly at [[Ingelheim]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=334}} Henry was allowed to attend the meeting, but it was dominated by his enemies.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=334}} Having no other choice, he abdicated in his son's favour on 31&nbsp;December.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=336}} Later, he said he resigned only because of his \"fears of imminent murder or execution\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=337}}\n\n==Last year==\n\n[[File:The funeral of the Emperor Henry IV.jpg|thumb|alt=A coffin before an altar, surrounded by bishops and monks|Henry's final funeral at the Speyer Cathedral in 1111 (from ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'', {{circa}} 1405)]]\n\nHenry was staying in Ingelheim after his abdication, but his supporters warned him his son had decided to imprison or execute him. In early February 1106, he fled to Cologne where he was received by the townspeople with great respect. He declined all ceremonies, demonstrating that he was doing penance for his sins. His loyal supporter, [[Othbert, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]], made peace with Henry of Limburg to secure the Duke's support. Henry joined them at Li\u00e8ge and mediated a reconciliation between Henry of Limburg and [[Albert III, Count of Namur]]. Robert&nbsp;II of Flanders also promised him assistance.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=338}} Henry addressed a letter to Hugh of Cluny, offering to accept all his terms in return for an absolution.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=339}} He also wrote letters to his son, the German princes and King [[Philip I of France]]. All of them show he was determined to regain his throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=86}}\n\nHenry V invaded Lorraine, but his father's supporters routed his army at [[Vis\u00e9]] on 22&nbsp;March 1106.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=86}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=339}} Henry of Limburg and the burghers of Cologne and Li\u00e8ge jointly persuaded the elderly Henry to \"resume the office of emperor\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=340}} Henry&nbsp;V laid siege to Cologne early in July but had to withdraw from the well-fortified town three or four weeks later.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=340}} The deposed Emperor sent letters to the German princes accusing his son of treachery and hypocrisy.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=340\u2013341}} He fell unexpectedly ill and died in Li\u00e8ge on 7&nbsp;August.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=343}}{{sfn|Barber|2004|p=184}} On his deathbed, he asked his son to pardon his supporters and to have him buried next to his ancestors in the [[Speyer Cathedral]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=343}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nBishop Othbert buried Henry in the [[Li\u00e8ge Cathedral]], but the excommunicated Emperor's body could not rest in a consecrated place.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=343}}{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|p=68}} Eight days later, his corpse was unearthed and buried in an unconsecrated [[chapel]] near Li\u00e8ge.

The sarcophagus was placed in an unconsecrated chapel of the Speyer Cathedral on 3&nbsp;September. Five years later, Pope Paschal&nbsp;II granted permission to the younger Henry to bury his father. Henry was buried next to his father in the cathedral on 7&nbsp;August 1111.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=344}}\n\n==Evaluation==\n\nHenry's conflicts with his subjects, both sons,{{sfn|McLaughlin|2010|p=176}} his wives and with the popes gave rise to a rich polemical literature during his lifetime. Both his supporters and his opponents based their portraits of Henry on two early medieval works: ''[[De duodecim abusivis saeculi|The Twelve Abuses]]'' contained a discussion about legitimate kingship, while [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'' contrasted kingship with tyranny. Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]]. In contrast [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] stated Henry had inherited a peaceful realm, but he \"rendered it filthy, despicable, bloodstrained, a prey to internal conflicts\". Lambert also emphasised that Henry destroyed and robbed churches and put freemen into servitude.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=345\u2013348}}\n\nRumours of Henry's immorality established his bad reputation for centuries.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} The Saxons were the first to accuse him of debauchery and demanded he dismiss the \"swarm of concubines with whom he slept\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=89, 113}} Polemical writings spreading in Germany after 1085 accused Henry of [[incest]] and [[pederasty]], also claiming that he had fathered illegitimate children.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}} Isidore of Seville listed immoral sexual practices among the tyrants' characteristics.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} Consequently, as Robinson emphasises, allegations of Henry's alleged sexual misconduct \"provided his opponents with a useful polemical weapon\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}}\n\nHenry was not a successful military commander, primarily because he did not avoid pitched battles in contrast with most 11th-century military leaders.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=349}} He could likely adopt this high-risk strategy because he often mustered his troops from among merchants and peasants who were regarded as expendable.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=350}} He lost most of his major battles; his sole victory at Homburg was primarily attributed to Rudolf of Rheinfelden by their contemporaries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy.jpg|thumb|middle|Henry IV and his first wife, Bertha of Savoy (11th-century painting).]]\n\nHenry's first wife, Bertha of Savoy, was a year younger than him.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=266}} Until 5&nbsp;August 1068, Henry regularly mentioned her as \"consort of our kingdom and our marriage-bed\" in his diplomas.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Her disappearance from the diplomas was the sign of a growing disaffection.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} Henry sought a divorce at a general assembly in June 1069 stating their marriage had not been [[Consummation|consummated]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=147}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} The assembled German aristocrats referred his request to a synod, which passed the matter to the Holy See in early October.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Henry's request outraged Pope Alexander II. He made it clear Henry would only be crowned emperor if he abandoned his plan.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=110}} Henry obeyed and Bertha was again mentioned regularly in his diplomas from 26&nbsp;October 1069.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=110}} Bertha gave birth to five children, but two of them\u2014Adelaide and Henry\u2014died in infancy.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=266}} Her surviving children

Mathilde.{{sfn|Andersson|Gade|2012|pp=307, 450}} According to this source, [[Magnus III of Norway]] exchanged messages with her and also composed a [[stanza]] for her.{{sfn|Andersson|Gade|2012|pp=307\u2013308}} Other primary sources do not list Mathilde among Henry's children.{{sfn|Andersson|Gade|2012|p=450}} Bertha died on 27&nbsp;December

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up in open rebellion]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a disconnect between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander&nbsp;II's successor, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory&nbsp;VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as [[Canossa]] to meet with the Pope. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's conflicts with the Popes and with his sons and wife, and his penitentiary \"Walk to Canossa\" established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, others describing him as an exemplary monarch. \n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as the heads of all Christians and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia. Henry&nbsp;III also outraged the Saxon duke, [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Bernard II]], because he supported the duke's main rival, Archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]], to seize Saxon counties.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=41\u201342}} The Salian kings who inherited their [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessors' domains in Saxony visited the province frequently. Their lengthy visits irritated the Saxon aristocrats who were exposed to direct royal control for more time than their peers in other parts of the empire. The Saxons' grievances against the Salian monarchs broke out in a series of revolts during Henry&nbsp;IV's reign.{{sfn|Leyser|1982|p=94}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on 11 November 1050, Henry was the son of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Henry III, by his second wife, [[Agnes of Poitou]].{{sfn|Hill|2020|p=93}} Henry was most likely born in his father's [[Imperial Palace of Goslar|palace]] at [[Goslar]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} His birth had been long-awaited; Henry III had fathered four daughters, but his subjects were convinced only a male heir could secure the \"peace of kingdom\" (as [[Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne]] called it in a sermon).{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} Henry was first named for his grandfather, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]], but Abbot [[Hugh of Cluny]], whom Henry&nbsp;III had appointed as his son's [[Godparent|godfather]], convinced the Emperor to give his name to his heir.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}} At Christmas 1050 the ailing Henry&nbsp;III designated his infant son as his successor in [[P\u00f6hlde]] (in Saxony).{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}} On this occasion, the Emperor also \"caused many of the princes\"\u2014most probably the Saxon and Thuringian aristocrats\u2014\"to promise an oath of fidelity and submission\" to Henry.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann baptised Henry in [[Cologne]] on Easter day 1051.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=19}} In November, the Emperor held an assembly at [[Tribur]] to secure his son's succession.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} The German princes who attended the meeting elected the one-year-old king. They stipulated they would acknowledge him as his father's successor only if he acted as a \"just ruler\" during his father's lifetime.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=21}} Historian Ian S. Robinson supposes the princes actually wanted to persuade Henry&nbsp;III to change his methods of government since the child king had no role in state administration.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} At Christmas 1052, the Emperor made Henry the duke of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=139}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}}\n\nArchbishop Hermann crowned Henry king in [[Aachen]] on 17&nbsp;July 1054.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} On this occasion, Henry's two-year-old younger brother, [[Conrad II, Duke of Bavaria|Conrad]], most likely received Bavaria from their father.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=22}} When Conrad died in 1055, the Emperor gave Bavaria to Empress Agnes.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=28, 98}} The Emperor betrothed Henry to [[Bertha of Savoy]] in late 1055.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Her parents, [[Adelaide of Susa|Adelaide, Margravine of Turin]], and [[Otto, Count of Savoy]], controlled north-western Italy. The Emperor wanted to secure their alliance against the rebellious Godfrey the Bearded.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III fell seriously ill after eating a stag's liver in late September 1056.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=25}} Historian Herbert Schutz attributes his sudden illness to his exhaustion.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=138}} Already dying, the Emperor commanded his son to the protection of [[Pope Victor II]] who had come from Italy to Germany.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}} Henry&nbsp;III died on 5&nbsp;October 1056.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}}\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Under guardianship===\n\n[[File:Aachener Dom BW 2016-07-09 13-49-15.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A marble throne|[[Throne of Charlemagne]] in the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] in Aachen.]]\n\nAt the age of six, Henry succeeded his father unopposed.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}} Pope Victor&nbsp;II convinced the German aristocrats to swear fealty to their young king and enthroned him in Aachen.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=26}} He reminded them of their promise to consult Empress Agnes in case her son predeceased her and a successor had to be named.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=141}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=28}} Although she had been planning to enter a [[nunnery]], Agnes was appointed her son's [[Legal guardian|guardian]].{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=52}} She was responsible for her son's education along with a royal ''[[ministerialis]]'' (or unfree servant), Cuno.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=48}} She secured the most powerful aristocrats' support through lavish grants.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=57}} Agnes was reconciled with Godfrey the Bearded and made her late husband's other opponent, [[Conrad III, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of the Ezzonen family]], [[duke of Carinthia]].{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=31}}\n\nAgnes took full control of state administration as [[regent]] after Pope Victor&nbsp;II left Germany early in 1057.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=27}} She paid little attention to Burgundy and Italy,{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=143}} but he insisted on her royal prerogative to appoint bishops and abbots to the vacant German sees and monasteries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=29}} Henry had inherited his father's Roman title of patrician, but the reformist concept of \"liberty of the church\" became dominant in Rome during his minority and his mother could not control papal elections.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Pope Victor's successor, [[Pope Stephen IX|Stephen&nbsp;IX]]\u2014Godfrey the Bearded's brother\u2014was elected without royal intervention early in August 1057, because the reformist clerics wanted to prevent their opponents from installing their own candidate as pope.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=37}}\n\nA group of Saxon aristocrats plotted against Henry, fearing he would continue his father's oppressive policies after reaching the age of majority. They convinced [[Otto, Margrave of the Nordmark|Otto of Nordmark]], who had recently returned from exile, to mount a coup.

In early February 1106, he fled to Cologne where he was received by the townspeople with great respect. He declined all ceremonies, demonstrating that he was doing penance for his sins. His loyal supporter, [[Othbert, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]], made peace with Henry of Limburg to secure the Duke's support. Henry joined them at Li\u00e8ge and mediated a reconciliation between Henry of Limburg and [[Albert III, Count of Namur]].

Both his supporters and his opponents based their portraits of Henry on two early medieval works: ''[[De duodecim abusivis saeculi|The Twelve Abuses]]'' contained a discussion about legitimate kingship, while [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae|Etymologies]]'' contrasted kingship with tyranny. Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]]. In contrast [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] stated Henry had inherited a peaceful realm, but he \"rendered it filthy, despicable, bloodstrained, a prey to internal conflicts\". Lambert also emphasised that Henry destroyed and robbed churches and put freemen into servitude.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=345\u2013348}}\n\nRumours of Henry's immorality established his bad reputation for centuries.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} The Saxons were the first to accuse him of debauchery and demanded he dismiss the \"swarm of concubines with whom he slept\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=89, 113}} Polemical writings spreading in Germany after 1085 accused Henry of [[incest]] and [[pederasty]], also claiming that he had fathered illegitimate children.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}} Isidore of Seville listed immoral sexual practices among the tyrants' characteristics.{{sfn|Vollrath|1995|pp=65\u201366}} Consequently, as Robinson emphasises, allegations of Henry's alleged sexual misconduct \"provided his opponents with a useful polemical weapon\".{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=113}}\n\nHenry was not a successful military commander, primarily because he did not avoid pitched battles in contrast with most 11th-century military leaders.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=349}} He could likely adopt this high-risk strategy because he often mustered his troops from among merchants and peasants who were regarded as expendable.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=350}} He lost most of his major battles; his sole victory at Homburg was primarily attributed to Rudolf of Rheinfelden by their contemporaries.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy.jpg|thumb|middle|Henry IV and his first wife, Bertha of Savoy (11th-century painting).]]\n\nHenry's first wife, Bertha of Savoy, was a year younger than him.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=266}} Until 5&nbsp;August 1068, Henry regularly mentioned her as \"consort of our kingdom and our marriage-bed\" in his diplomas.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Her disappearance from the diplomas was the sign of a growing disaffection.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} Henry sought a divorce at a general assembly in June 1069 stating their marriage had not been [[Consummation|consummated]].{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=147}}{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=109}} The assembled German aristocrats referred his request to a synod, which passed the matter to the Holy See in early October.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=109\u2013110}} Henry's request outraged Pope Alexander II.

The character worked as a launderette assistant for most of that time, along with original character [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993. In reality, Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the axing of her co-star [[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]], who played [[Pete Beale]] from the show's first episode to early 1993. Brown returned to the role in April 1997, and on 28 April 2017, Dot overtook [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) as the second-longest-serving character in ''EastEnders'', surpassed only by original character [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/june-browns-wet-fart-eastenders-exit-sad-insulting-end-one-tvs2/|title=June Brown\u2019s \u2018wet fart\u2019 EastEnders exit is a sad, insulting end for one of TV\u2019s finest actors|first=Michael|last=Brogan|date=21 February 2020|accessdate=1 April 2020|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>  In a special episode entitled ''EastEnders: Dot's Story'' (2003) a young Dot was played by Tallulah Pitt-Brown in flashbacks.

Brown left the role in January 2020. On April 2020, it was confirmed June will make an final apperance before Eastenders makes an hiatus due to [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. It is expected whe will be killed off from  [[COVID-19|Coronavirus]].\n\nA [[tragicomic]] character, Dot was known for her devout Christian faith, gossiping, [[chain smoking]], [[hypochondria]], and motherly attitude to those in need. A recurring storyline in the serial has been Dot's continuous forgiveness of her son's villainous crimes. Initially married at the start of the series to conman [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), Dot married again in 2002 to pensioner [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]) and the union proved to be popular with fans. Brown and Bardon won awards for their screen partnership. On 31 January 2008, Dot became the first character ever to appear in a monologue episode, \"[[Pretty Baby....]]\", of a British soap. The acclaimed episode saw Dot reminiscing about her years of loss and grief into a tape recorder as a message to her ailing husband Jim. Dot has been used to explore topical and controversial issues such as euthanasia, cancer, immigration and homophobia.\n\nDot has been generally well received by critics: she has been referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by [[Alistair McGowan]], and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\n\nDot's backstory states that she was born in [[Walford]], the main setting for ''EastEnders'', and was evacuated to Wales as a child during the Second World War. Her guardians, [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Gwen|Gwen]] ([[Eve Myles]]; Gwenllian Davies) and [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Will|Will]] (Dafydd Emyr), wished to adopt her, but Dot returned to Walford after Will's death and spent the remainder of her childhood helping her neglectful mother care for her younger half-siblings: Gerry, Tim and [[Rose Cotton (EastEnders)|Rose]] ([[Polly Perkins]]).\n\nAged 18, Dot married [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]). The following year, he forced her to have an abortion; threatening to leave her if she did not, but left anyway. While Dot was giving birth to their son, [[Nick Cotton|Nick]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), Charlie was having an affair with her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, with Charlie making unannounced returns and departures sporadically, and although Dot doted on Nick, she was not an affectionate mother.\n\n===1985\u20131993===\n\nDot is introduced to ''EastEnders'' soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) and [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) who works with [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]) and [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and Dot is devastated.\n\nHowever, Dot causes trouble for certain residents too, although not intentionally. She is responsible for the break-up of [[Saeed Jeffery]]'s ([[Andrew Johnson (actor)|Andrew Johnson]]) marriage to [[Naima Jeffery]] ([[Shreela Ghosh]]). Due to the lack of lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting sex workers. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does not deny it so she leaves him.\n\nIn May 1989, Nick tells Dot during an off-screen prison visit that he is married to a woman called Hazel (Virginia Fiol), and that the couple have young daughter; Nick had avoided telling her due to their strained relationship. Hazel visits Dot with the baby, Dorothy Nicola, in May of the same year, revealing that Nick got 240 hours of [[community service]]) instead of a prison sentence. However, this is revealed to be a lie as Charlie follows Hazel and finds that the baby is actually her niece, Katy Joanna. Dot refuses to believe him at first but Hazel is forced to admit she has been lying.\n\nIn 1993, Nick's girlfriend [[Zoe Newton]] (Elizabeth Chadwick) arrives in Walford and introduces Dot to their nine-year-old son, [[Ashley Cotton]] (Rossi Higgins). Dot becomes close to Ashley and eventually Zoe asks her to move to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] with them. Dot then leaves Albert Square.\n\n===1997\u20132020===\n\nDot returns nearly four years later when [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (English actor)|Paul Bradley]]) tracks her down. She reveals that Nick has been arrested for drugs possession and Zoe and Ashley have moved away. After being held hostage by a convict friend of Nick, she returns to the square and is shocked when Nick returns unexpectedly. He tries to steal her money again by claiming he has AIDS and needs money to pay for illegally imported medication. Dot believes him but later discovers it is a lie and he is on the run from the police. She contacts the police, and he is arrested a week after his return.\n\nDot moves in with fellow senior citizen [[Lilly Mattock]] ([[Barbara Keogh]]) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes to stay with the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against euthanasia and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is imprisoned for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+Watch%3a+I'm+panting+to+find+out+how+they+got+such+a+head+start.-a067820252|title=TV Watch: I'm panting to find out how they got such a head start.|work=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen Nick and Ashley (now [[Frankie Fitzgerald]]) reappear in Walford, Dot is pleased to have her family around and moves out of the Fowler household to live with them. However, Nick's feud with Pauline's son, [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), causes Ashley's death after Nick cuts the brakes on Mark's motorbike and Ashley steals it and crashes. Dot disowns Nick after Ashley's funeral, having overheard the truth about Ashley's death during an earlier argument between Nick and Mark. She starts a relationship with neighbour [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]), but when he proposes, she is overwhelmed and leaves Walford. Jim perseveres and when they go on the [[London Eye]] one Christmas Eve, he proposes again and she accepts. They decide that they will have a platonic marital relationship. Dot is diagnosed with [[kidney cancer]] and decides not to tell anyone except her friend [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]). She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly, but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery. When Dot finds an abandoned baby, [[Tomas Covalenco|Tomas]], in a church, she takes him home, leaving her contact details at the church and subsequently Tomas' mother [[Anya Covalenco|Anya]] ([[Olga Fedori]]) arrives in Walford, revealing she is an illegal immigrant. Jim anonymously reports Anya and when she is deported, Dot hides Tomas from the authorities, vowing to take care of him. Dot and Jim struggle to look after the baby and, after talking to the local vicar and her old friend [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]), Dot decides to hand him over to Social Services. Jim suffers a stroke, leaving him seriously ill. Jim is placed in a nursing home, but Dot struggles with this decision and tries at a later date to care for Jim at home. However, she finds being a full-time carer exhausting and lonely. Eventually, after Dot experiences ill-health brought on by stress, Jim moves back to a nursing home.\n\nWhen Nick returns after a seven year absence, he tells Dot he has changed and is now a plumber, introducing her to his six-year-old daughter [[Dotty Cotton]] ([[Molly Conlin]]). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage in the caf\u00e9, resulting in an explosion. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Sandy|Sandy]] ([[Caroline Pegg]]), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is sorry to see Dotty go.\n\nDot develops a friendship with vicar [[Edward Bishop (EastEnders)|Edward Bishop]] ([[Frank Barrie]]), who develops romantic intentions towards her. Dot turns Edward down, remaining loyal to her husband. She takes in various lodgers, including [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]), her sister Rose and [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]), who causes Dot problems with the council for failing to pay the rent, leaving her in arrears. Dot is taken to court but manages to persuade the judge to allow her to keep her home and avoids a prison sentence. Fatboy later allows his girlfriend [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]) to move in with him and Dot, and Dot forms a close bond with Poppy. When Fatboy and Poppy break up and Poppy moves out, Fatboy gently assures Dot that she and Poppy are still friends.\n\nDot receives a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One of the police officers returns later to tell her that he is actually her grandson [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]), a child of Nick's Dot had not known existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that he does not want to leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fianc\u00e9e, [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house.\n\nUnable to leave the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug addiction and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of [[Reg Cox]] (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess to the police and is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.\n\nFour months later, Dot is released and shares her regret with Ian that she did not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. [[Richard Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ricky Mitchell]] (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and [[Kim Fox|Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween, such as [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Fowler]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) getting electrocuted and [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects [[age-related macular degeneration]], which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.\n\nAbi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she has plans of her own. The launderette closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is too busy to visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her deceased friend [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names [[Dave (EastEnders)|Dave]]. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to [[The Queen Victoria]] pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), and her sister [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children that they are in heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, [[Matthew Mitchell Cotton]], but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but he is only back for his son and she is upset when he leaves again with Matthew. Dot's step-granddaughter [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing.\n\nDot trips over Dave and falls awkwardly onto a chair. Nobody knows she is injured until her step-granddaughter, [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames her neighbours for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation on her hip but she refuses physiotherapy. Dot goes to stay with Dotty for three months, returning when she hears that Abi is brainstem dead after an accident. Dot is surprised to see the launderette had reopened and [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) is working there. After attending Abi's funeral, Dot goes to stay with Charlie, Liz and Matthew in Ireland. Dot returns several months later. She is worried about her health and despite being told by her doctor that she is fine, she visits Dr Legg. He confirms that she is in good health and reveals he is dying of [[pancreatic cancer]]. Dot is shocked that he is refusing treatment but eventually accepts his decision and decides to make the most of the time they have left together. Dot cares for Dr Legg in her home until his death. She inherits his entire estate and goes away to visit her family.\n\nDot returns with Dotty and she buys her council house with her inherited money. She later discovers that an attempt to take \u00a35,000 out of her bank account has failed. It is revealed that Sonia tried to take the money.

Unlike Dot, Nick is scripted as a semi-regular character, one who comes and goes sporadically and, as authors Jill Marshall and Angela Werndly have observed, \"we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son, 'Nasty Nick', turns up [...] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Jill Marshall, Angela Werndly |title= The language of television |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9DkOhFnbMhkC&pg=PA55&dq=eastenders+dot++NICK#PPA59,M1 |year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415287944|accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nExecutive producer [[Diederick Santer]] has discussed the \"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\" Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance regardless of his history of wrongdoing.<ref name=\"revealed\">{{cite episode|title=EastEnders Revealed: Nick Cotton Returns|series=EastEnders Revealed|serieslink=EastEnders Revealed|credits=Richard Mears (director, producer), Mark Cossey (executive producer)|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC1]]|airdate=30 December 2008|number=55}}</ref> Santer explained: \"There\u2019s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone\u2019s changed, which is really tragic. They\u2019ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they\u2019ll have changed.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> Actor [[Leslie Grantham]] has stated that Dot is the \"one friend in [Nick's] life\", while series story producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] has affirmed: \"Dot\u2019s always going to forgive him. And that\u2019s the beauty of Nick and Dot.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: \"No matter what he does, she\u2019ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably [[Al Capone]]'s mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" />\n\nOne of Nick's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim that he was a born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her \u00a310,000 win on the bingo. ''EastEnders'' writer [[Sarah Phelps]] explained: \"For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting&nbsp;\u2013 a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father [[Charlie Cotton|Charlie]], Dot's close friend [[Ethel Skinner]] and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the \"one time we saw a glimmer of Nick\u2019s good side\",<ref name=\"revealed\" /> Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nOther storylines have concentrated on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go [[cold turkey]]. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, [[The Queen Victoria]] landlord [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, \"he got away with murder\" for a second time in the serial.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely responsible for the death of his son [[Ashley Cotton|Ashley]] ([[Frankie Fitzgerald]]) in June 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick and prompting to leave the Square again. He is not seen for more than seven years after this, although he was mentioned in 2006 when recovering from cancer off-screen.<ref name=\"revealed\" />\n\nFollowing pleas from Brown to resurrect Nick, John Altman returned to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, [[Dotty Cotton|Dotty]] ([[Molly Conlin]]), who was born in 2002 after Nick's previous exit.<ref name=\"revealed\" />  Altman explained: \"Nick needed something, because I think if he didn\u2019t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> As the storyline progressed, it was revealed that Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed [[dementia]] then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/john-altman-on-nicks-dramatic-exit/5916/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402013058/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/john-altman-on-nicks-dramatic-exit/5916/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 April 2012|title= John Altman on Nick's dramatic exit!|work=What's on TV|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.\n\nNick reappears in Albert Square seven months after his faked death. Ronnie takes an instant dislike to him and tries to bribe him to leave but Nick returns for Charlie and Ronnie's wedding. Nick decides to get revenge on Ronnie and cuts the brakes of her car. After the wedding, Roxy, Charlie and Ronnie are involved in an accident which hits and later kills Emma Summerhayes, while Ronnie ends up in a coma but survives. Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car. Yvonne tells Charlie but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him. Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie's accident, so Charlie asks them both to leave. Dot hides Nick next door and obtains heroin for Nick. Later she finds him unconscious, Nick regains consciousness briefly but later dies in Dot's arms, in the same location that Reg Cox was discovered 30 years earlier.\n\n====Charlie====\nLike Nick, Dot's first screen husband, [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), was also a semi-regular character who came and went throughout his duration in the show. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically would reappear in the show whenever he needed money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie would always be permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie was \"a truly revolting character, a loser.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/christopher-hancock-533730.html|title= Christopher Hancock|work=The Independent |location=London |date=19 November 2004|accessdate=23 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nProducers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died off-screen when crashing his lorry on a motorway.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the ''EastEnders Handbook'' publication in 1991: \"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory.

She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, \"I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a [[hitch-hiker]] and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nCharlie's funeral episode, written by Linda Dearsley, was aired on 11 July 1991, and was dominated by Dot's reaction to Charlie's death and her trip to identify his body.

During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: \"Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I caught a glimpse of her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out \"[[Roll Out the Barrel]]\". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel.\"<ref name=\"banks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/01/lastnightstveastenders1|title=Last night's TV: EastEnders|last=Banks-Smith|first=Nancy|date=1 February 2008|work=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=2 May 2009 }}</ref> Critic for ''The Guardian'', [[Nancy Banks-Smith]], discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by [[Dylan Thomas]]: \"There was always one pretty and pert [Ethel], and always one in glasses [Dot].\" Banks-Smith adds that theirs was \"a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship.\"<ref name=\"banks\"/>\n\nTheir bickering and personality differences were often used for comic effect; however, in episode 248 of the show, scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] notes that viewers were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot's friendship in the soaps [[EastEnders two-hander episodes#Dot and Ethel (2 July 1987)|second two-hander episode]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The episode aired in July 1987 and featured just the two old ladies. Brake has described the episode as a \"mini-play about nostalgia and growing old\", adding that \"some viewers found it too unusual, but many others were charmed by the change of pace\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/> According to Brake, the episode gave Franklin and Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]], a future producer of the show.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Author Christine Geraghty has used the episode as an example of the fact that \"female conversation is the backbone to traditional soap\".<ref name=\"women\"/>\n\nAuthor Dorothy Hobson has discussed the use of older female characters in British soap opera as a means of providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in ''EastEnders'' to the trio of [[Ena Sharples]], [[Minnie Caldwell]] and [[Martha Longhurst]] from ''[[Coronation Street]]'' with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at ''EastEnders'' attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of \"'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series.\"<ref name=\"dorothy\"/> An example of this was the character [[Lilly Mattock]] ([[Barbara Keogh]]) who appeared between 1998 and 1999.<ref name=\"lillyaxed\">{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60161734.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110517014720/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60161734.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 17 May 2011 |title= Busy Lilly's axed from the Square|work=[[The People]] | date = 26 September 1999| accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref>  The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because \"far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', there is a need for unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience.\"<ref name=\"dorothy\"/> Brown has spoken about the \"wonderful rapport\" she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, \"I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started.\"<ref name=\"webchat\"/>\n\nThroughout her time in ''EastEnders'', many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the character has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in ''EastEnders''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&ArticleID=1924266 |title=The ender Pauline |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |author=Hazan, Sophie |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075543/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&ArticleID=1924266 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, [[Pauline Fowler]], played by [[Wendy Richard]] from 1985\u20132006.

In reality, Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the axing of her co-star [[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]], who played [[Pete Beale]] from the show's first episode to early 1993.

Brown left the role in January 2020. \n\nA [[tragicomic]] character, Dot was known for her devout Christian faith, gossiping, [[chain smoking]], [[hypochondria]], and motherly attitude to those in need. A recurring storyline in the serial has been Dot's continuous forgiveness of her son's villainous crimes. Initially married at the start of the series to conman [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), Dot married again in 2002 to pensioner [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]) and the union proved to be popular with fans. Brown and Bardon won awards for their screen partnership. On 31 January 2008, Dot became the first character ever to appear in a monologue episode, \"[[Pretty Baby....]]\", of a British soap. The acclaimed episode saw Dot reminiscing about her years of loss and grief into a tape recorder as a message to her ailing husband Jim. Dot has been used to explore topical and controversial issues such as euthanasia, cancer, immigration and homophobia.\n\nDot has been generally well received by critics: she has been referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by [[Alistair McGowan]], and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\n\nDot's backstory states that she was born in [[Walford]], the main setting for ''EastEnders'', and was evacuated to Wales as a child during the Second World War. Her guardians, [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Gwen|Gwen]] ([[Eve Myles]]; Gwenllian Davies) and [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Will|Will]] (Dafydd Emyr), wished to adopt her, but Dot returned to Walford after Will's death and spent the remainder of her childhood helping her neglectful mother care for her younger half-siblings: Gerry, Tim and [[Rose Cotton (EastEnders)|Rose]] ([[Polly Perkins]]).\n\nAged 18, Dot married [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]). The following year, he forced her to have an abortion; threatening to leave her if she did not, but left anyway. While Dot was giving birth to their son, [[Nick Cotton|Nick]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), Charlie was having an affair with her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, with Charlie making unannounced returns and departures sporadically, and although Dot doted on Nick, she was not an affectionate mother.\n\n===1985\u20131993===\n\nDot is introduced to ''EastEnders'' soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) and [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]) who works with [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]) and [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and Dot is devastated.\n\nHowever, Dot causes trouble for certain residents too, although not intentionally. She is responsible for the break-up of [[Saeed Jeffery]]'s ([[Andrew Johnson (actor)|Andrew Johnson]]) marriage to [[Naima Jeffery]] ([[Shreela Ghosh]]). Due to the lack of lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting sex workers. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does not deny it so she leaves him.\n\nIn May 1989, Nick tells Dot during an off-screen prison visit that he is married to a woman called Hazel (Virginia Fiol), and that the couple have young daughter; Nick had avoided telling her due to their strained relationship. Hazel visits Dot with the baby, Dorothy Nicola, in May of the same year, revealing that Nick got 240 hours of [[community service]]) instead of a prison sentence. However, this is revealed to be a lie as Charlie follows Hazel and finds that the baby is actually her niece, Katy Joanna. Dot refuses to believe him at first but Hazel is forced to admit she has been lying.\n\nIn 1993, Nick's girlfriend [[Zoe Newton]] (Elizabeth Chadwick) arrives in Walford and introduces Dot to their nine-year-old son, [[Ashley Cotton]] (Rossi Higgins). Dot becomes close to Ashley and eventually Zoe asks her to move to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] with them. Dot then leaves Albert Square.\n\n===1997\u20132020===\n\nDot returns nearly four years later when [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (English actor)|Paul Bradley]]) tracks her down. She reveals that Nick has been arrested for drugs possession and Zoe and Ashley have moved away. After being held hostage by a convict friend of Nick, she returns to the square and is shocked when Nick returns unexpectedly. He tries to steal her money again by claiming he has AIDS and needs money to pay for illegally imported medication. Dot believes him but later discovers it is a lie and he is on the run from the police. She contacts the police, and he is arrested a week after his return.\n\nDot moves in with fellow senior citizen [[Lilly Mattock]] ([[Barbara Keogh]]) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes to stay with the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against euthanasia and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is imprisoned for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TV+Watch%3a+I'm+panting+to+find+out+how+they+got+such+a+head+start.-a067820252|title=TV Watch: I'm panting to find out how they got such a head start.|work=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen Nick and Ashley (now [[Frankie Fitzgerald]]) reappear in Walford, Dot is pleased to have her family around and moves out of the Fowler household to live with them. However, Nick's feud with Pauline's son, [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), causes Ashley's death after Nick cuts the brakes on Mark's motorbike and Ashley steals it and crashes. Dot disowns Nick after Ashley's funeral, having overheard the truth about Ashley's death during an earlier argument between Nick and Mark. She starts a relationship with neighbour [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]), but when he proposes, she is overwhelmed and leaves Walford. Jim perseveres and when they go on the [[London Eye]] one Christmas Eve, he proposes again and she accepts. They decide that they will have a platonic marital relationship. Dot is diagnosed with [[kidney cancer]] and decides not to tell anyone except her friend [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]). She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly, but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery. When Dot finds an abandoned baby, [[Tomas Covalenco|Tomas]], in a church, she takes him home, leaving her contact details at the church and subsequently Tomas' mother [[Anya Covalenco|Anya]] ([[Olga Fedori]]) arrives in Walford, revealing she is an illegal immigrant. Jim anonymously reports Anya and when she is deported, Dot hides Tomas from the authorities, vowing to take care of him. Dot and Jim struggle to look after the baby and, after talking to the local vicar and her old friend [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]), Dot decides to hand him over to Social Services. Jim suffers a stroke, leaving him seriously ill. Jim is placed in a nursing home, but Dot struggles with this decision and tries at a later date to care for Jim at home. However, she finds being a full-time carer exhausting and lonely. Eventually, after Dot experiences ill-health brought on by stress, Jim moves back to a nursing home.\n\nWhen Nick returns after a seven year absence, he tells Dot he has changed and is now a plumber, introducing her to his six-year-old daughter [[Dotty Cotton]] ([[Molly Conlin]]). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage in the caf\u00e9, resulting in an explosion. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Sandy|Sandy]] ([[Caroline Pegg]]), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is sorry to see Dotty go.\n\nDot develops a friendship with vicar [[Edward Bishop (EastEnders)|Edward Bishop]] ([[Frank Barrie]]), who develops romantic intentions towards her. Dot turns Edward down, remaining loyal to her husband. She takes in various lodgers, including [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]), her sister Rose and [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]), who causes Dot problems with the council for failing to pay the rent, leaving her in arrears. Dot is taken to court but manages to persuade the judge to allow her to keep her home and avoids a prison sentence. Fatboy later allows his girlfriend [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]) to move in with him and Dot, and Dot forms a close bond with Poppy. When Fatboy and Poppy break up and Poppy moves out, Fatboy gently assures Dot that she and Poppy are still friends.\n\nDot receives a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One of the police officers returns later to tell her that he is actually her grandson [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]), a child of Nick's Dot had not known existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that he does not want to leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fianc\u00e9e, [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house.\n\nUnable to leave the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug addiction and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of [[Reg Cox]] (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess to the police and is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.\n\nFour months later, Dot is released and shares her regret with Ian that she did not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. [[Richard Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ricky Mitchell]] (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and [[Kim Fox|Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween, such as [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Fowler]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) getting electrocuted and [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects [[age-related macular degeneration]], which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.\n\nAbi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she has plans of her own. The launderette closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is too busy to visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her deceased friend [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names [[Dave (EastEnders)|Dave]]. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to [[The Queen Victoria]] pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), and her sister [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children that they are in heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, [[Matthew Mitchell Cotton]], but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but he is only back for his son and she is upset when he leaves again with Matthew. Dot's step-granddaughter [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing.\n\nDot trips over Dave and falls awkwardly onto a chair. Nobody knows she is injured until her step-granddaughter, [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames her neighbours for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation on her hip but she refuses physiotherapy. Dot goes to stay with Dotty for three months, returning when she hears that Abi is brainstem dead after an accident. Dot is surprised to see the launderette had reopened and [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]) is working there. After attending Abi's funeral, Dot goes to stay with Charlie, Liz and Matthew in Ireland. Dot returns several months later. She is worried about her health and despite being told by her doctor that she is fine, she visits Dr Legg. He confirms that she is in good health and reveals he is dying of [[pancreatic cancer]]. Dot is shocked that he is refusing treatment but eventually accepts his decision and decides to make the most of the time they have left together. Dot cares for Dr Legg in her home until his death. She inherits his entire estate and goes away to visit her family.\n\nDot returns with Dotty and she buys her council house with her inherited money. She later discovers that an attempt to take \u00a35,000 out of her bank account has failed. It is revealed that Sonia tried to take the money. Sonia is later blackmailed after [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) is involved in a hit-and-run and she successfully steals \u00a38,000 from Dot when Dot signs a blank cheque for Sonia to pay for some baby clothes she bought for the baby that Charlie and his wife are now expecting. Dot tells Sonia that this money was stolen and when Sonia tells Martin what she did, Martin tells Dot that he took the money. Sonia convinces Dot to visit Charlie again in Ireland and Dot leaves Sonia a message asking her to find out why Martin took the money and to let her know.\n\n==Creation==\nAlthough Dot had been referred to since the very early episodes of the programme as the mother of villain [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), she did not actually appear on-screen until episode 40 in July 1985.<ref name=\"insidestory\">{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|author2=Holland, Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title= EastEnders&nbsp;\u2013 The Inside Story |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=978-0-563-20601-9|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Dot was conceptualised by show creators, [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]], along with the other original characters.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> Introduced as the \"bible thumping, arch-gossip\" of the launderette, Dot was a character who bridged the generations.<ref name=\"insidestory\"/> The actress [[June Brown]] was given the role after being recommended by actor [[Leslie Grantham]], who played original character, [[Den Watts]].<ref name=\"int\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7452896.stm|title=Profile: June Brown|publisher=BBC News  |date=13 June 2008|accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nBrown was offered the part of Dot Cotton for a period of three months initially and in her own words, she was brought in \"merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again\".<ref name=\"fifteen\">{{cite video |date=2000|title= Eastenders&nbsp;\u2013 15 Years Of Eastenders|medium=VHS |publisher=BBC }}</ref> Brown has told [[Decca Aitkenhead]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen ''EastEnders'' once on television, \"and there was an argument going on, and I thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it off.

Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered.<ref name=\"webchat\"/> She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985.

Unlike Dot, Nick is scripted as a semi-regular character, one who comes and goes sporadically and, as authors Jill Marshall and Angela Werndly have observed, \"we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son, 'Nasty Nick', turns up [...] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Jill Marshall, Angela Werndly |title= The language of television |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9DkOhFnbMhkC&pg=PA55&dq=eastenders+dot++NICK#PPA59,M1 |year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415287944|accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nExecutive producer [[Diederick Santer]] has discussed the \"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\" Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance regardless of his history of wrongdoing.<ref name=\"revealed\">{{cite episode|title=EastEnders Revealed: Nick Cotton Returns|series=EastEnders Revealed|serieslink=EastEnders Revealed|credits=Richard Mears (director, producer), Mark Cossey (executive producer)|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC1]]|airdate=30 December 2008|number=55}}</ref> Santer explained: \"There\u2019s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone\u2019s changed, which is really tragic. They\u2019ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they\u2019ll have changed.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> Actor [[Leslie Grantham]] has stated that Dot is the \"one friend in [Nick's] life\", while series story producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] has affirmed: \"Dot\u2019s always going to forgive him. And that\u2019s the beauty of Nick and Dot.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: \"No matter what he does, she\u2019ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably [[Al Capone]]'s mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" />\n\nOne of Nick's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim that he was a born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her \u00a310,000 win on the bingo. ''EastEnders'' writer [[Sarah Phelps]] explained: \"For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting&nbsp;\u2013 a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father [[Charlie Cotton|Charlie]], Dot's close friend [[Ethel Skinner]] and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the \"one time we saw a glimmer of Nick\u2019s good side\",<ref name=\"revealed\" /> Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nOther storylines have concentrated on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go [[cold turkey]]. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, [[The Queen Victoria]] landlord [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, \"he got away with murder\" for a second time in the serial.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely responsible for the death of his son [[Ashley Cotton|Ashley]] ([[Frankie Fitzgerald]]) in June 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick and prompting to leave the Square again. He is not seen for more than seven years after this, although he was mentioned in 2006 when recovering from cancer off-screen.<ref name=\"revealed\" />\n\nFollowing pleas from Brown to resurrect Nick, John Altman returned to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, [[Dotty Cotton|Dotty]] ([[Molly Conlin]]), who was born in 2002 after Nick's previous exit.<ref name=\"revealed\" />  Altman explained: \"Nick needed something, because I think if he didn\u2019t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.\"<ref name=\"revealed\" /> As the storyline progressed, it was revealed that Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed [[dementia]] then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/john-altman-on-nicks-dramatic-exit/5916/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402013058/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/interviews/john-altman-on-nicks-dramatic-exit/5916/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 April 2012|title= John Altman on Nick's dramatic exit!|work=What's on TV|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.\n\nNick reappears in Albert Square seven months after his faked death. Ronnie takes an instant dislike to him and tries to bribe him to leave but Nick returns for Charlie and Ronnie's wedding. Nick decides to get revenge on Ronnie and cuts the brakes of her car. After the wedding, Roxy, Charlie and Ronnie are involved in an accident which hits and later kills Emma Summerhayes, while Ronnie ends up in a coma but survives. Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car. Yvonne tells Charlie but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him. Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie's accident, so Charlie asks them both to leave. Dot hides Nick next door and obtains heroin for Nick. Later she finds him unconscious, Nick regains consciousness briefly but later dies in Dot's arms, in the same location that Reg Cox was discovered 30 years earlier.\n\n====Charlie====\nLike Nick, Dot's first screen husband, [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), was also a semi-regular character who came and went throughout his duration in the show. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically would reappear in the show whenever he needed money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie would always be permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie was \"a truly revolting character, a loser.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/christopher-hancock-533730.html|title= Christopher Hancock|work=The Independent |location=London |date=19 November 2004|accessdate=23 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nProducers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died off-screen when crashing his lorry on a motorway.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the ''EastEnders Handbook'' publication in 1991: \"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [her friend] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, \"I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a [[hitch-hiker]] and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nCharlie's funeral episode, written by Linda Dearsley, was aired on 11 July 1991, and was dominated by Dot's reaction to Charlie's death and her trip to identify his body. It is selected by writer Colin Brake as one of 1991's episodes of the year.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\n====Jim====\n[[Image:Dot&jim0.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jim Branning|Jim]] proposes to Dot, 21 December 2001.

In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, ''Walford Gazette'', he commented, \"No way did the pair of us want to get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right.\"<ref name=\"wit\"/> Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had just suffered the death of her grandson Ashley (in which Nick had played a part), and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death \"would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [but] with marrying Jim she gets a family&nbsp;\u2013 that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again&nbsp;\u2013 it will have a central point, they will be able to use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there.\"<ref name=\"webchat\"/>\n\nCritic [[Grace Dent]] has likened Dot and Jim to  ''Coronation Street'''s [[Hilda Ogden|Hilda]] and [[Stan Ogden]], comparing a scene in ''EastEnders'' where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from ''Coronation Street'', that aired decades before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/30/tvandradio.theguide|title=Crowned with glory|date=22 March 2005|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=6 December 2008  | first=Grace | last=Dent}}</ref> Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: \"Initially, Jim wasn't the sort of person that Dot approved of.

''[[BBC News]]'' has described Dot and Ethel as an \"incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious\".<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/4678803.stm Remembering EastEnders' Ethel]\", ''BBC''. URL. Retrieved 24 October 2006.</ref> Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: \"Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I caught a glimpse of her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out \"[[Roll Out the Barrel]]\". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel.\"<ref name=\"banks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/01/lastnightstveastenders1|title=Last night's TV: EastEnders|last=Banks-Smith|first=Nancy|date=1 February 2008|work=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=2 May 2009 }}</ref> Critic for ''The Guardian'', [[Nancy Banks-Smith]], discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by [[Dylan Thomas]]: \"There was always one pretty and pert [Ethel], and always one in glasses [Dot].\" Banks-Smith adds that theirs was \"a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship.\"<ref name=\"banks\"/>\n\nTheir bickering and personality differences were often used for comic effect; however, in episode 248 of the show, scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] notes that viewers were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot's friendship in the soaps [[EastEnders two-hander episodes#Dot and Ethel (2 July 1987)|second two-hander episode]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/> The episode aired in July 1987 and featured just the two old ladies. Brake has described the episode as a \"mini-play about nostalgia and growing old\", adding that \"some viewers found it too unusual, but many others were charmed by the change of pace\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/> According to Brake, the episode gave Franklin and Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]], a future producer of the show.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Author Christine Geraghty has used the episode as an example of the fact that \"female conversation is the backbone to traditional soap\".<ref name=\"women\"/>\n\nAuthor Dorothy Hobson has discussed the use of older female characters in British soap opera as a means of providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in ''EastEnders'' to the trio of [[Ena Sharples]], [[Minnie Caldwell]] and [[Martha Longhurst]] from ''[[Coronation Street]]'' with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at ''EastEnders'' attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of \"'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series.\"<ref name=\"dorothy\"/> An example of this was the character [[Lilly Mattock]] ([[Barbara Keogh]]) who appeared between 1998 and 1999.<ref name=\"lillyaxed\">{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60161734.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110517014720/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60161734.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 17 May 2011 |title= Busy Lilly's axed from the Square|work=[[The People]] | date = 26 September 1999| accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref>  The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because \"far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', there is a need for unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience.\"<ref name=\"dorothy\"/> Brown has spoken about the \"wonderful rapport\" she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, \"I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started.\"<ref name=\"webchat\"/>\n\nThroughout her time in ''EastEnders'', many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the character has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in ''EastEnders''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&ArticleID=1924266 |title=The ender Pauline |work=Yorkshire Evening Post |author=Hazan, Sophie |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928075543/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=39&ArticleID=1924266 |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, [[Pauline Fowler]], played by [[Wendy Richard]] from 1985\u20132006.
