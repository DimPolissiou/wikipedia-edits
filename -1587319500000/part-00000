It follows a Marine who was killed in action, only to be brought back to life with superpowers by an organization that wants to use him as a weapon.\n\nDevelopment of a Bloodshot film began in 2012, with [[Jared Leto]] originally in talks to star in July 2017. In March 2018, Diesel was hired to portray the title role, and the rest of the cast joined over the following months. Filming commenced in South Africa in August 2018, lasting through October.\n\n''Bloodshot'' was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $29 million worldwide. Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Sony made the film available digitally on-demand less than two weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter leading a successful rescue operation in [[Mombasa]], U.S. Airman Ray Garrison and his wife Gina travel for a holiday at an Italian beachside town in the [[Amalfi Coast]]. However, they are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe, who demands to know the source of the Mombasa hostage operation. Since Ray is not privy to this information, Axe kills him and Gina.\n\nRay is later resurrected by Rising Spirit Tech, a company that specializes in developing cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. The company's CEO, Dr. Emil Harting, tells Ray that he is the first successful candidate that they have resurrected using a [[nanorobotics|special nanite technology]]. Ray is also introduced to Dr Harting's other patients including former [[United States Navy|US Navy]] diver \"KT\", whom he strikes a friendship with, and former soldiers Jimmy Dalton and Marcus Tibbs, with whom he gets on poorly.\n\nAfter experiencing \"flashbacks\" of Gina and Axe, Ray escapes Rising Spirit's laboratory in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and pursues Axe, seeking to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites to hack into computer databases, Ray tracks down Axe to [[Budapest]]. After trapping his convoy in a tunnel, Ray kills Axe's bodyguards before executing the mercenary. He is later recovered by KT, Dalton and Tibbs, who bring him back to Rising Spirit for reprogramming. In truth, Harting created false memories of Gina's death as part of a plot to eliminate rivals in Rising Spirit.\n\nAfter his memories are wiped and reprogrammed, Ray is sent to kill Nick Baris in [[East Sussex]], \"remembering\" him to be Gina's killer. Though Ray manages to kill Baris and his bodyguards, Baris has forced computer programmer Wilfred Wigans to build an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP bomb]], which is ignited after Baris' death, incapacitating Ray and severing communications with Rising Spirit. After \"resurrecting\" Ray, Wigans reveals that Rising Spirit planted false memories to turn him into a killing machine. Ray also discovers Gina is alive but had left him five years ago and started a family in [[Westminster]].\n\nGrowing disillusioned with Harting's exploitation of Ray, KT seeks Wigans' help in taking him down. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs following a pursuit. He is brought back to Rising Spirit's laboratory for reprogramming, but escapes with the help of KT and Wigans, who sabotage the reprogramming process and Rising Spirit's computers. Breaking free, Ray fights Dalton and Tibbs on top of an elevator. Dalton willingly lets Tibbs fall to his death before continuing the fight until Ray punches him down the elevator shaft, killing him. Ray confronts Harting, who manages to drain the nanites, but is killed when the second grenade he shoots at Ray is dismantled by the nanites and dropped directly at his feet. Ray is later rebuilt by Wigans and KT, and the three then leave in search of a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Bloodshot (comics)|Ray Garrison / Bloodshot]]\n* [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] as KT\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as Jimmy Dalton\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Martin Axe\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Dr. Emil Harting\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Wilfred Wigans\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Gina Garrison\n* Alex Hernandez as Marcus Tibbs\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Nick Baris\n* Tamer Burjaq as  Mombasa Gunman\n* Siddharth Dhananjay as Eric\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2012, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] had acquired the film rights to the [[Valiant Comics]] character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]], which would be produced by [[Original Film]] and [[Valiant Entertainment]].

It follows a Marine who was killed in action, only to be brought back to life with superpowers by an organization that wants to use him as a weapon.\n\nDevelopment of a Bloodshot film began in 2012, with [[Jared Leto]] originally in talks to star in July 2017. In March 2018, Diesel was hired to portray the title role, and the rest of the cast joined over the following months. Filming commenced in South Africa in August 2018, lasting through October.\n\n''Bloodshot'' was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $29 million worldwide. Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Sony made the film available digitally on-demand less than two weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter leading a successful rescue operation in [[Mombasa]], U.S. Airman Ray Garrison and his wife Gina travel for a holiday at an Italian beachside town in the [[Amalfi Coast]]. However, they are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe, who demands to know the source of the Mombasa hostage operation. Since Ray is not privy to this information, Axe kills him and Gina.\n\nRay is later resurrected by Rising Spirit Tech, a company that specializes in developing cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. The company's CEO, Dr. Emil Harting, tells Ray that he is the first successful candidate that they have resurrected using a [[nanorobotics|special nanite technology]]. Ray is also introduced to Dr Harting's other patients including former [[United States Navy|US Navy]] diver \"KT\", whom he strikes a friendship with, and former soldiers Jimmy Dalton and Marcus Tibbs, with whom he gets on poorly.\n\nAfter experiencing \"flashbacks\" of Gina and Axe, Ray escapes Rising Spirit's laboratory in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and pursues Axe, seeking to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites to hack into computer databases, Ray tracks down Axe to [[Budapest]]. After trapping his convoy in a tunnel, Ray kills Axe's bodyguards before executing the mercenary. He is later recovered by KT, Dalton and Tibbs, who bring him back to Rising Spirit for reprogramming. In truth, Harting created false memories of Gina's death as part of a plot to eliminate rivals in Rising Spirit.\n\nAfter his memories are wiped and reprogrammed, Ray is sent to kill Nick Baris in [[East Sussex]], \"remembering\" him to be Gina's killer. Though Ray manages to kill Baris and his bodyguards, Baris has forced computer programmer Wilfred Wigans to build an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP bomb]], which is ignited after Baris' death, incapacitating Ray and severing communications with Rising Spirit. After \"resurrecting\" Ray, Wigans reveals that Rising Spirit planted false memories to turn him into a killing machine. Ray also discovers Gina is alive but had left him five years ago and started a family in [[Westminster]].\n\nGrowing disillusioned with Harting's exploitation of Ray, KT seeks Wigans' help in taking him down. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs following a pursuit. He is brought back to Rising Spirit's laboratory for reprogramming, but escapes with the help of KT and Wigans, who sabotage the reprogramming process and Rising Spirit's computers. Breaking free, Ray fights Dalton and Tibbs on top of an elevator. Dalton willingly lets Tibbs fall to his death before continuing the fight until Ray punches him down the elevator shaft, killing him. Ray confronts Harting, who manages to drain the nanites, but is killed when the second grenade he shoots at Ray is dismantled by the nanites and dropped directly at his feet. Ray is later rebuilt by Wigans and KT, and the three then leave in search of a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Bloodshot (comics)|Ray Garrison / Bloodshot]]\n* [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] as KT\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as Jimmy Dalton\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Martin Axe\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Dr. Emil Harting\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Wilfred Wigans\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Gina Garrison\n* Alex Hernandez as Marcus Tibbs\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Nick Baris\n* Tamer Burjaq as  Mombasa Gunman\n* Siddharth Dhananjay as Eric\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2012, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] had acquired the film rights to the [[Valiant Comics]] character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]], which would be produced by [[Original Film]] and [[Valiant Entertainment]].

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

Walker Library]], which served white patrons only.\n\nThe Leon County Public Library was established in May 1955 and the first Leon County free public library opened its doors on March 21, 1956, in 5,000 square feet of [[The Columns (Tallahassee, Florida)|The Columns]], one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area, and located at Park and Adams. Close to 5,000 volumes were on its shelves.\n\nThe Library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street in 1962, more than doubling its space to 12,000 square feet as opposed to the original library's size of 5,000 square feet.\n\nThe Leon County Public Library became the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System after [[Jefferson County, Florida|Jefferson County]] joined in 1970 and [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla County]] joined in 1971.  The original name returned when Wakulla County left the library system in 1975 and Jefferson County left in 1980.\n\nA small branch library called Page One opened in the Bond Community in September 1975 and the main library moved again to a 44,000 square foot space in the lower level of the Northwood Mall on North Monroe St. The idea to create a new building for the main library began in 1986. The proposed building would be 88,000 square feet and cost $8.5 million to build.  The ground breaking was held on March 4, 1989 for the main library facility. The site was next door to the library's original home, [[The Columns (Tallahassee, Florida)|The Columns]], which had been moved in 1971.<ref>http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref> The new library building officially opened in January 1991.\n\nSandra Wilson, who was to oversee the development of the library's new home, was the library director from 1988 until 1991. Helen Moeller took over for her in 1992. \n\nThe Leon County Public Library was renamed the LeRoy Collins Leon County Public Library on September 17, 1993 in honor of [[LeRoy Collins]], the 33rd Governor of Florida.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governor Thomas LeRoy Collins|url=http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/About-LeRoy-Collins|website=Leon County|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nFebruary 2016 marked the LeRoy Collins Main Library 25th anniversary.

Walker Library]], which served white patrons only.\n\nThe Leon County Public Library was established in May 1955 and the first Leon County free public library opened its doors on March 21, 1956, in 5,000 square feet of [[The Columns (Tallahassee, Florida)|The Columns]], one of the oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area, and located at Park and Adams. Close to 5,000 volumes were on its shelves.\n\nThe Library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street in 1962, more than doubling its space to 12,000 square feet as opposed to the original library's size of 5,000 square feet.\n\nThe Leon County Public Library became the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System after [[Jefferson County, Florida|Jefferson County]] joined in 1970 and [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla County]] joined in 1971.  The original name returned when Wakulla County left the library system in 1975 and Jefferson County left in 1980.\n\nA small branch library called Page One opened in the Bond Community in September 1975 and the main library moved again to a 44,000 square foot space in the lower level of the Northwood Mall on North Monroe St. The idea to create a new building for the main library began in 1986. The proposed building would be 88,000 square feet and cost $8.5 million to build.  The ground breaking was held on March 4, 1989 for the main library facility. The site was next door to the library's original home, [[The Columns (Tallahassee, Florida)|The Columns]], which had been moved in 1971.<ref>http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref> The new library building officially opened in January 1991.\n\nSandra Wilson, who was to oversee the development of the library's new home, was the library director from 1988 until 1991. Helen Moeller took over for her in 1992. \n\nThe Leon County Public Library was renamed the LeRoy Collins Leon County Public Library on September 17, 1993 in honor of [[LeRoy Collins]], the 33rd Governor of Florida.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governor Thomas LeRoy Collins|url=http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/About-LeRoy-Collins|website=Leon County|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nFebruary 2016 marked the LeRoy Collins Main Library 25th anniversary.

Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldier's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later, Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child.\n\nZiggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation.\n\nBy the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Denny Reagan\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Ziggy Brennan\n* [[William Marshall (bandleader)|William Marshall]] as CPO Martin J.

Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a soldier's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the soldier. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later, Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child.\n\nZiggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation.\n\nBy the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Dunn (actor)|James Dunn]] as Denny Reagan\n* [[Mona Freeman]] as Ziggy Brennan\n* [[William Marshall (bandleader)|William Marshall]] as CPO Martin J.
