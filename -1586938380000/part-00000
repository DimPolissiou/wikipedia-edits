In the music video, PewDiePie criticizes T-Series for alleged tax evasion and for achieving their early success by selling pirated songs. He also mocks how T-Series sent him a [[cease and desist]] letter alleging that his actions and lyrics of \"Bitch Lasagna\" were defamatory. The video also thanks his fans for sticking with him through his YouTube career, referencing past notable videos.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/31/18275692/pewdiepie-tseries-feud-concession-diss-track |title=PewDiePie admits defeat to T-Series |last=Radulovic |first=Petrana |date=31 March 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge\">{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Julia|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million|title=PewDiePie concedes to T-Series in battle for YouTube's biggest channel|work=[[The Verge]]|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47042761 |title=PewDiePie concedes defeat to YouTube rival T-Series |date=1 April 2019 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the song was uploaded to YouTube, PewDiePie regained his lead against T-Series.<ref name=Tobin2019>{{cite web|last=Tobin|first=Ben|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|title=PewDiePie back on top as largest YouTube channel over Indian music label T-Series|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 April 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404024138/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|archive-date=4 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Eight days after the release of \"Congratulations,\" both music videos were banned in India when the [[Delhi High Court]] granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.<ref name=Pardiwalla2019>{{cite web|last=Pardiwalla|first=Tanzim|url=https://in.mashable.com/culture/2952/did-the-high-court-just-pick-sides-in-the-t-series-vs-pewdiepie-war-banning-diss-tracks|title=Did The High Court Just Pick Sides In the T-Series vs PewDiePie War, Banning Diss Tracks?|work=[[Mashable|Mashable India]]|date=12 April 2019|accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hale2019>{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Jame|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/04/15/t-series-court-order-sees-abusive-vulgar-racist-pewdiepie-diss-tracks-blocked-in-india/|title=T-Series Court Order Sees \"Abusive, Vulgar, Racist\" PewDiePie Diss Tracks Blocked In India|work=[[Tubefilter]]|date=15 April 2019|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, PewDiePie's videos remain blocked in India.<ref name=Ghosh2019b>{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shona|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pewdiepie-and-t-series-settle-youtube-legal-dispute-2019-8|title=PewDiePie and T-Series quietly settled a court battle over 'racist' diss tracks following their epic YouTube battle|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=13 August 2019|accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2019, following PewDiePie's surpassing 100 million subscribers and a few months of Minecraft gameplay videos, PewDiePie released \"Mine All Day (Minecraft music video)\".
