Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme]]s, structural proteins or [[hormone]]s and therefore, are crucial biological components. As a result, protein synthesis is regulated at multiple steps <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=  Sixth}}</ref>. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are some distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule [[messenger RNA]] by enzymes - called [[RNA polymerases]] - in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form which undergoes processing and modification through post-transcriptional modifications. The now mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The amino acids are joined together by [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, a protein must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]] required to function as an enzyme. In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease, as changes and errors in this process through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene (known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|3-prime]] (3') end) to the end of the gene (called the 5-prime (5') end). Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of nucleotides using a [[phosphodiester bond]] to the growing polynucleotide chain by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand. Behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of 4 bases - [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] (G, C, A and T) - RNA is also composed of 4 bases - guanine, cytosine, adenine and [[uracil]]. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil, therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil <ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

In contrast, the 3' Poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule. The Poly(A) tail is composed of a 100-200 adenine bases added by enzymes to the end of the pre-mRNA molecule <ref name=\"Khan2020\"/>. These distinct 5' and 3' mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is present and intact, if both the 5' cap and 3' tail are present <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThis processed pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon]]s, introns are nucleotide sequences within the gene that do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences which directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule, therefore, in order to produce an mature mRNA molecule encoding a protein,  splicing must occur <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/> Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through post-translational modification, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>.\n\nThere are four key types of post-translational modification:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].

Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right)]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits.<ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref> Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage.

In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form which undergoes processing and modification through post-transcriptional modifications. The now mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The amino acids are joined together by [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, a protein must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]] required to function as an enzyme. In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease, as changes and errors in this process through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding are often the underlying causes of a disease.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene (known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|3-prime]] (3') end) to the end of the gene (called the 5-prime (5') end). Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of nucleotides using a [[phosphodiester bond]] to the growing polynucleotide chain by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand.

The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/> Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through post-translational modification, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>.\n\nThere are four key types of post-translational modification:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].

Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]], by a protein [[kinase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right)]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits.<ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref> Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is the single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref> which changes codon 6 from encoding glutamic acid to encoding valine.<ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\"/>\n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual.<ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Addition to post-transcriptional modification section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}

Relations occur on the diplomatic, political, military, economic, and cultural level between France and Italy, officially the [[Italy|Italian Republic]] (since 1946), and its predecessors, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (Piedmont) (1814\u20131861) and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861\u20131946). France played a major role in helping the unification of Italy, especially by the defeat of the Austrian Empire, as well as financial support. They were rivals for control of Tunisia and North Africa in the late 19th century. France won out, which led Italy to join the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in 1882 with Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Tensions were high in the 1880s as expressed in a trade war. France needed allies against Germany, so it secretly negotiated a series of arrangements and treaties with Italy that by 1902 made sure that Italy would not support Germany in a war. When World War I broke out in 1914, Italy was neutral at first but bargained for territorial aggrandizement. The best offer was made by Britain and France, who promised Italy large swaths of Austria and the Ottoman Empire. Both countries were among the \"[[Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" of the Allies; however, Italian resentment at the difference between the promises of 1915 and the actual results of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles would be powerful factors in the rise of Benito Mussolini in 1922. In the interwar era, France tried to be friendly with Mussolini to avoid his support of Hitler's Nazi Germany. That failed and when Germany defeated France in 1940, Italy also declared war, and was given control of an occupied zone near the common border. Corsica was added in 1942. Both nations were among the [[Inner six]] that founded the [[European Community]], the predecessor of the European Union. They are also founding members of the [[G7]]/[[G8]] and [[NATO]].

The wider French-Italian border region had been part of the [[Kingdom of Arelat]] during the 11th to 14th centuries.\n\nThe border between France and Savoy had remained in flux since the [[Italian Wars]]. In the early modern period, it was fixed in the [[Treaty of Turin (1696)|Treaty of Turin of 1696]]. After the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[House of Savoy]] made large territorial gains, becoming the 18th-century nucleus for the later [[Italian unification]]. Savoy was occupied by revolutionary France from  1792 to 1815. Savoy, along with Piedmont and Nice, was conjoined into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] at the Congress of Vienna in  1815,<ref>Wells, H.

Introduced a number of major reforms that permanently altered the political and legal systems of the multiple small countries on the Italian peninsula, and helped inspire Italian nationalism and a demand for unification. The feudal laws were repealed, and the administration became a matter of expertise rather than corruption and patronage. Government was no longer the preserve of the aristocracy, but was open up to the middle classes and professionals. Most church lands were sold off, systems of wealth. Conservatism returned with the Congress of Vienna 1814, but it failed to eliminate The new spirit introduced by Napoleon. Many secret societies were formed to transform and unify Italy; anticlericalism was an important new element, challenging the people rule over central Italy, and the Catholic Church is major role throughout the peninsula. The ideas of liberty led to \"[[Risorgimento]]\" which carried implications of unification, modernization and moral reform.<ref>Martin Collier, ''Italian Unification 1820-71'' ( Heinemann, 2003) pp 1-31.</ref>\n\n===Unification of Italy===\nFrance played a central role as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] sponsored the unification of Italy in 1850s, and then blocking it by protecting the papal states in the 1860s.<ref>William E.

He plotted with [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|the Italian kingdom of Piedmont]] to expel Austria and set up an Italian confederation of four new states headed by the pope. Events in 1859 ran out of Napoleon's control in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. Austria was quickly defeated, but instead of four new states a popular uprising a new sense of Italian nationalism united all of Italy under Piedmont. The pope held onto Rome only because Napoleon sent troops to protect him. France's reward was the [[County of Nice]] (which included the city of [[Nice]] and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. Piedmont, known officially as the kingdom of Sardinia, worked closely with France to unify Italy\u2014militarily by pushing Austria out, and financially by providing over one&nbsp;billion gold francs in 1848\u20131860, which was half the money Sardinia needed. Cavour used the Rothschild Bank in Paris extensively, but also plated off against British and other European financiers.<ref>Rondo E.

Napoleon then reversed himself and angered both the anticlerical liberals in France and his erstwhile Italian allies when he protected the pope in Rome. When war with Prussia loomed in 1870, France withdrew its armies and the new Italian government absorbed the papal states and Rome.<ref>Harry Hearder, ''Cavour'' (1994) 99-159.</ref>\n\n===1870-1919===\nRelations after 1870 saw episodes of diplomatic and economic hostility, originating primarily in competition for control of North Africa. Germany's Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] was worried by French revanchism\u2014searching for revenge for the loss of Alsace Lorraine \u2013 so he sought to neutralize that by encouraging French expansion in Tunisia. Italy, a latecomer to imperialism also wanted Tunisia  because many Italians lived there and especially because control of both Tunis and Sicily would make it a major Mediterranean power. France was closer and had many well-established business operations there.  Italy was outmaneuvered, as Britain and Germany supported France. The French army invaded and took over Tunisia and Italians were furious. Franco-Italian relations were sharply negative through the 1880s. For example, there were disputes over tariffs and trade between the two countries plunged. [[Francesco Crispi]] a leading politician on the left, was indefatigable in stirring up hostility toward France.<ref>Mark I.

When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies).]]\n\nIn a spirit of revenge against France, Italy formed a military alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882, the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The new [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser William II]] removed Bismarck from power in 1890, and engaged in reckless diplomatic adventurism in North Africa that disturbed Rome and Paris. Around this time, French and Italian relations became better after setlling disputes. Italy's solution was to secretly move much closer to France, especially in the secret treaty of 1892, which effectively annulled the Italian membership in the Triple Alliance as far as ever making war against France. Tariff issues were resolved and in 1900, France supported Italy's ambitions to take over Tripolitania (modern Libya), and Italy recognized French predominance in Morocco.  In 1902 both sides came to an understanding that regardless of the Italian renewal of membership in the Triple Alliance, Italy would not go to war with France.\n\nAll the dealings were secret, and Berlin and Vienna did not realize it had lost an ally.<ref>Christopher Andrew, ''Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9 and the Making of the Entente Cordiale: A Reappraisal of French Foreign Policy 1898\u20131905'' (1968) pp 20, 82, 144, 190.</ref>  As a consequence, when the First World War broke out in July 1914, Italy announced the Triple Alliance did not apply, declared itself neutral, and negotiated the best deal available. Britain and France thought Italian military manpower would be an advantage, and offered Italy large swaths of territory from Austria and the Ottoman Empire.

Italy demanded and received parity with the French Navy and terms of battleships at the Washington Conference of 1922. Tunisia remained a sore point, since it was a large Italian colony there. France considered itself the protector of the independent state of Ethiopia, which Italy had long coveted. However the Italian army was badly defeated at Adowa in 1896, so until 1935 Italy focused on its colonies in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.  In European affairs, Mussolini proposed that four powers, Britain, France, Italy, and Germany cooperate to dominate European affairs. France rejected the idea and the [[Four-Power Pact]] signed in July 1933 was vague and was never ratified by the four powers. After 1933 France tried to be friendly with Mussolini to avoid his support of Hitler's Nazi Germany.<ref>Jacques N\u00e9r\u00e9, ''The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945'' (2002) pp 132-154.</ref>\n\n====Ethiopia====\nWhen [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935]], the League of Nations condemned the action and imposed an oil boycott on Italy.

France rejected the demands. Paris suspected that Italy's true intentions were territorial acquisition of Nice, Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti. France also launched threatening naval maneuvers as a warning to Italy. As tensions between Italy and France escalated, Hitler made a major speech on 30 January 1939 in which he promised German military support in the case of an unprovoked war against Italy.<ref>Burgwyn, ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918-1940'' pp 194-185.</ref>\n\n====World War II====\nWhen Germany was on the verge of victory over France in 1940, Italy also declared war and [[Italian invasion of France|invaded southern France]].

Relations occur on the diplomatic, political, military, economic, and cultural level between France and Italy, officially the [[Italy|Italian Republic]] (since 1946), and its predecessors, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (Piedmont) (1814\u20131861) and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (1861\u20131946). France played a major role in helping the unification of Italy, especially by the defeat of the Austrian Empire, as well as financial support. They were rivals for control of Tunisia and North Africa in the late 19th century. France won out, which led Italy to join the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in 1882 with Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Tensions were high in the 1880s as expressed in a trade war. France needed allies against Germany, so it secretly negotiated a series of arrangements and treaties with Italy that by 1902 made sure that Italy would not support Germany in a war. When World War I broke out in 1914, Italy was neutral at first but bargained for territorial aggrandizement. The best offer was made by Britain and France, who promised Italy large swaths of Austria and the Ottoman Empire. Both countries were among the \"[[Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" of the Allies; however, Italian resentment at the difference between the promises of 1915 and the actual results of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles would be powerful factors in the rise of Benito Mussolini in 1922. In the interwar era, France tried to be friendly with Mussolini to avoid his support of Hitler's Nazi Germany.

The wider French-Italian border region had been part of the [[Kingdom of Arelat]] during the 11th to 14th centuries.\n\nThe border between France and Savoy had remained in flux since the [[Italian Wars]]. In the early modern period, it was fixed in the [[Treaty of Turin (1696)|Treaty of Turin of 1696]]. After the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[House of Savoy]] made large territorial gains, becoming the 18th-century nucleus for the later [[Italian unification]]. Savoy was occupied by revolutionary France from  1792 to 1815. Savoy, along with Piedmont and Nice, was conjoined into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] at the Congress of Vienna in  1815,<ref>Wells, H.

Introduced a number of major reforms that permanently altered the political and legal systems of the multiple small countries on the Italian peninsula, and helped inspire Italian nationalism and a demand for unification. The feudal laws were repealed, and the administration became a matter of expertise rather than corruption and patronage. Government was no longer the preserve of the aristocracy, but was open up to the middle classes and professionals. Most church lands were sold off, systems of wealth. Conservatism returned with the Congress of Vienna 1814, but it failed to eliminate The new spirit introduced by Napoleon. Many secret societies were formed to transform and unify Italy; anticlericalism was an important new element, challenging the people rule over central Italy, and the Catholic Church is major role throughout the peninsula. The ideas of liberty led to \"[[Risorgimento]]\" which carried implications of unification, modernization and moral reform.<ref>Martin Collier, ''Italian Unification 1820-71'' ( Heinemann, 2003) pp 1-31.</ref>\n\n===Unification of Italy===\nFrance played a central role as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] sponsored the unification of Italy in 1850s, and then blocking it by protecting the papal states in the 1860s.<ref>William E.

He plotted with [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|the Italian kingdom of Piedmont]] to expel Austria and set up an Italian confederation of four new states headed by the pope. Events in 1859 ran out of Napoleon's control in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. Austria was quickly defeated, but instead of four new states a popular uprising a new sense of Italian nationalism united all of Italy under Piedmont. The pope held onto Rome only because Napoleon sent troops to protect him. France's reward was the [[County of Nice]] (which included the city of [[Nice]] and the rugged Alpine territory to its north and east) and the [[Duchy of Savoy]]. Piedmont, known officially as the kingdom of Sardinia, worked closely with France to unify Italy\u2014militarily by pushing Austria out, and financially by providing over one&nbsp;billion gold francs in 1848\u20131860, which was half the money Sardinia needed. Cavour used the Rothschild Bank in Paris extensively, but also plated off against British and other European financiers.<ref>Rondo E.

Napoleon then reversed himself and angered both the anticlerical liberals in France and his erstwhile Italian allies when he protected the pope in Rome. When war with Prussia loomed in 1870, France withdrew its armies and the new Italian government absorbed the papal states and Rome.<ref>Harry Hearder, ''Cavour'' (1994) 99-159.</ref>\n\n===1870-1919===\nRelations after 1870 saw episodes of diplomatic and economic hostility, originating primarily in competition for control of North Africa. Germany's Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] was worried by French revanchism\u2014searching for revenge for the loss of Alsace Lorraine \u2013 so he sought to neutralize that by encouraging French expansion in Tunisia. Italy, a latecomer to imperialism also wanted Tunisia  because many Italians lived there and especially because control of both Tunis and Sicily would make it a major Mediterranean power. France was closer and had many well-established business operations there.  Italy was outmaneuvered, as Britain and Germany supported France. The French army invaded and took over Tunisia and Italians were furious. Franco-Italian relations were sharply negative through the 1880s. For example, there were disputes over tariffs and trade between the two countries plunged.

When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies).]]\n\nIn a spirit of revenge against France, Italy formed a military alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882, the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The new [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser William II]] removed Bismarck from power in 1890, and engaged in reckless diplomatic adventurism in North Africa that disturbed Rome and Paris. Italy's solution was to secretly move much closer to France, especially in the secret treaty of 1892, which effectively annulled the Italian membership in the Triple Alliance as far as ever making war against France. Tariff issues were resolved and in 1900, France supported Italy's ambitions to take over Tripolitania (modern Libya), and Italy recognized French predominance in Morocco.  In 1902 both sides came to an understanding that regardless of the Italian renewal of membership in the Triple Alliance, Italy would not go to war with France.\n\nAll the dealings were secret, and Berlin and Vienna did not realize it had lost an ally.<ref>Christopher Andrew, ''Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9 and the Making of the Entente Cordiale: A Reappraisal of French Foreign Policy 1898\u20131905'' (1968) pp 20, 82, 144, 190.</ref>  As a consequence, when the First World War broke out in July 1914, Italy announced the Triple Alliance did not apply, declared itself neutral, and negotiated the best deal available. Britain and France thought Italian military manpower would be an advantage, and offered Italy large swaths of territory from Austria and the Ottoman Empire.

Italy demanded and received parity with the French Navy and terms of battleships at the Washington Conference of 1922. Tunisia remained a sore point, since it was a large Italian colony there. France considered itself the protector of the independent state of Ethiopia, which Italy had long coveted. However the Italian army was badly defeated at Adowa in 1896, so until 1935 Italy focused on its colonies in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.  In European affairs, Mussolini proposed that four powers, Britain, France, Italy, and Germany cooperate to dominate European affairs. France rejected the idea and the [[Four-Power Pact]] signed in July 1933 was vague and was never ratified by the four powers. After 1933 France tried to be friendly with Mussolini to avoid his support of Hitler's Nazi Germany.<ref>Jacques N\u00e9r\u00e9, ''The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945'' (2002) pp 132-154.</ref>\n\n====Ethiopia====\nWhen [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935]], the League of Nations condemned the action and imposed an oil boycott on Italy.

France rejected the demands. Paris suspected that Italy's true intentions were territorial acquisition of Nice, Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti. France also launched threatening naval maneuvers as a warning to Italy. As tensions between Italy and France escalated, Hitler made a major speech on 30 January 1939 in which he promised German military support in the case of an unprovoked war against Italy.<ref>Burgwyn, ''Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918-1940'' pp 194-185.</ref>\n\n====World War II====\nWhen Germany was on the verge of victory over France in 1940, Italy also declared war and [[Italian invasion of France|invaded southern France]].

These include [[Simon Vouet]], [[Valentin de Boulogne]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Pierre Subleyras]].\n\nThe [[Villa Medici]] in Rome hosts the [[French Academy in Rome]]. The Academy was founded in 1666 by Louis XIV to train French artists (painters, sculptors, architects) and make them familiar with Roman and Italian Renaissance art. Today the Academy is responsible for promoting French culture in Italy.\n\nFrom 1734 to 1861, the Kingdom of Naples and of Sicily were under the domination of the Spanish branch of the [[Bourbon dynasty]], originating from France. [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], king of Naples was the grand son of [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Louis, Dauphin de France]], son of [[Louis XIV]].\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic era]], large parts of Italy were under French control and some were annexed to the [[First French Empire]]. The Kingdom of Naples was ruled by [[Joseph Bonaparte]], brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and then by Marshall [[Joachim Murat]] : it was under Joseph Bonaparte's rule that feudalism was abolished, in 1806.\n\nThe [[Savoy dynasty]] who ruled on [[Piedmont]] and [[Sardinia]] and was responsible for the [[unification of Italy]] in [[1861]] is of French descent, coming from the French speaking region of [[Savoie]], in the western Alps.\n\n==Institutions==\nBoth France and Italy are founder members of the [[European Union]] and adopted the [[euro]] from its introduction.\n\nSince 1982, an annual summit has formalised French-Italian cooperation.  The first was held in [[Villa Madama]].<ref>http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/italy/france-and-italy/political-relations-6992/</ref>\n\n==Military==\n[[File:S.M. il Re di Sardegna con l'Imperatore francese Napoleone III.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] and [[Napoleon III]]]]\nThe Prime minister of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] [[Camillo Benso]] was able to take [[Napoleon III]] on his side after the [[Orsini affair]] during the [[Italian Unification]]: The French army was allied with [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] and defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Magenta]] and the [[Battle of Solferino]]. After that, France opposed Italy during the [[Capture of Rome]] (but did not do anything to prevent it), that represented the end of the [[Temporal power (Papal)|Papal temporal power]].\n\nAfter [[World War I]] the governments of the two countries were both among the [[The Big Four (World War I)|big four]] that defeated the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe last military conflict was the [[Second Battle of the Alps]] in April 1945.\n\n==Sport==\n* [[France-Italy football rivalry]] is one of the most famous sport rivalries worldwide.\n* The [[Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy]] is a trophy for the winner of the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations match]] between [[France national rugby union team|France]] and [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] in [[rugby union]].\n\n== Resident diplomatic missions ==\n* France has an embassy in [[Rome]] and consulates-general in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]].<ref>[https://it.ambafrance.org/ Embassy of France in Rome]</ref>\n* Italy has an embassy in [[Paris]] and consulates-general in [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Metz]] and [[Nice]].<ref>[https://ambparigi.esteri.it/ambasciata_parigi/it/ Embassy of Italy in Paris]</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Palais Farnese.jpg|Embassy of France in Rome\nFile:Paris 7e H\u00f4tel de la Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville 85.JPG|Embassy of Italy in Paris\nFile:Consulat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'Italie Paris.jpg|Consulate-General of Italy in Paris\nFile:Lyon 6e - 5 Rue du Commandant Faurax - Consulat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'Italie.JPG|Consulate-General of Italy in Lyon\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[H\u00f4tel de Boisgelin (Rue de Varenne, Paris)|H\u00f4tel de Boisgelin]] : Italian embassy in France\n* [[Palazzo Farnese]] : French embassy in Italy.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  Cameron, Rondo E. \"French Finance and Italian Unity: The Cavourian Decade.\" ''American Historical Review'' 62.3 (1957): 552\u2013569.

The first club to tour on the region was [[Southampton F.C.]] in 1904, followed by several teams (mainly from England although some Scottish clubs also visited South America) until 1929 with [[Chelsea F.C.]] being the last team to tour.\n\nDuring those 25 years of tours, British teams' performances were decreasing while the South American squads' style of playing improved. Indeed, Southampton won all of their matches in 1904 with 40 goals scored in 1904 while Chelsea was defeated eight times (over 16 games played) in their 1929 tour.<ref name=chelseatour/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{see|Football in Argentina|Football in Uruguay|Football in Brazil}}\n\nFootball (and other British-origin sports like [[rugby union]]) were gaining popularity in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] and the associations brought foreign teams to their countries as a way of encourage the practise of the sport among the large number of enthusiasts.<ref name=iwa>''Historia del F\u00fatbol Amateur en la Argentina'', by Jorge Iwanczuk.

[[Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club|CURCC]] (in Uruguay), [[Belgrano Athletic Club|Belgrano A.C.]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]], [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] (in Argentina) are some examples of clubs established by British immigrants to South America.<ref name=iwa/><ref name=cuna>[https://www.lacapital.com.ar/ovacion/plaza-jewell-el-club-donde-nacioacute-el-deporte-rosarino-cumple-hoy-145-antildeos-n361847.html Plaza Jewell, el club donde naci\u00f3 el deporte rosarino, cumple hoy 145 a\u00f1os], ''La Capital'', 27 Mar 2012</ref>\n\nFootball had been introduced many years ago in both countries, being the first game played in Argentina on June 20, 1867,<ref>[https://www.clarin.com/deportes/futbol/siglo-medio-primer-partido-futbol-argentina-sudamerica_0_Sy4a5eLXb.html A un siglo y medio del primer partido de f\u00fatbol en la Argentina y en Sudam\u00e9rica] by Oscar Barnade, ''Clar\u00edn'', 20 Jun 2017</ref> with the establishment of [[Buenos Aires Football Club]], the first football club not only in Argentina but in South America.<ref name=iwa/><ref name=yametti>''Historia de F\u00fatbol de AFA: Or\u00edgenes 1891/1899'', by Carlos Yametti.

Argentina organised its first league championship, [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], in [[1891 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1891]] while its [[Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Uruguayan homonymous]] held its first championship in [[1900 Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1900]].\n\nBoth countries considered themselves rivals due to their proximity. Moreover, they had the only organised bodies in South America and had held some earlier competitions such as [[Tie Cup]] (1900) or [[Copa de Honor Cousenier]] (1905), played by champions of each association.\n\nIn some cases, the influence of British clubs on Argentine football extended to the colours adopted by some clubs. Ar\u00edstides Langone, president of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente]], was so impressed by the Nottingham Forest squad that beat local Alumni by 6\u20130 that he suggested to change the jersey colours from white and blue to red. The request was approved and Independiente adopted the colour that would later become an identity mark for the club, being known as ''El Rojo (The Red)''.<ref>[https://www.ole.com.ar/independiente/Independiente-Nottingham-Forest-unidos-siempre_0_324567670.html Independiente y Nottingham Forest unidos para siempre] on ''Ol\u00e9'', 27 Aug 2010</ref>\n\nSome versions also state that Quilmes A.C. was another institution that took the colours from a British squad, in this case the white jersey with blue details of the [[England national football team|English national team]], although there is no evidence to prove that statement.\n\n== Tours ==\n[[Southampton F.C.]] was the first foreign club to tour South America, followed by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.]] in 1905. One of its games, against [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] in Buenos Aires, was attended by 10,000 spectators, what proves the interest of Argentine fans to see the local forces facing British sides, considered technically superior by them.<ref name=soccer/>\n\nThe first team to defeat a British side was Argentine Alumni, who defeated the [[South Africa national football team|South Africa team]] (mostly composed of British\u2013origin players) by 1\u20130 at [[Sociedad Sportiva Argentina]] stadium in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. The relevance of the victory was expressed by local media, such as ''[[La Naci\u00f3n (newspaper)|La Naci\u00f3n]]'' writing: \"For our national football, the Alumni v South Africa match was a great triumph that will be remembered for a long time in everyone's memory, serving as example and stimulus for the future\", while British-origin newspaper ''The Standard'' wrote \"it was a glorious victory and what happened in La Sportiva is promising for Argentine football\".<ref name=southafrica>[https://www.clarin.com/deportes/cien-anos-triunfazo_0_B1RatEyAYl.html A cien a\u00f1os de un triunfazo] on ''Clar\u00edn'', 24 June 2006</ref>\n\n[[Corinthian F.C.]] of [[London]] was the first British club to tour [[Brazil]] in 1910, playing ten games in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Sao Paulo]].

After a half hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that [[Patsy Corcoran]] would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another [[pitch invasion]]. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell who took it himself and scored. This prompted a further pitch invasion by the Boca fans and this time the match was abandoned.<ref name=green1>[http://www.greensonscreen.co.uk/argylehistory.asp?era=1920-1930 Chapter 13: 1920-1930] by Colin Parsons on Green on Screen website</ref>\n\n[[Chelsea F.C.]] was the last British club to tour South America, in 1929. Since the first tour in 1904, the South American players had evolved a lot, as they were described as \"true masters in tactical play\" by Chelsea chairman Kirby himself.

[[Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club|CURCC]] (in Uruguay), [[Belgrano Athletic Club|Belgrano A.C.]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]], [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] (in Argentina) are some examples of clubs established by British immigrants to South America.<ref name=iwa/><ref name=cuna>[https://www.lacapital.com.ar/ovacion/plaza-jewell-el-club-donde-nacioacute-el-deporte-rosarino-cumple-hoy-145-antildeos-n361847.html Plaza Jewell, el club donde naci\u00f3 el deporte rosarino, cumple hoy 145 a\u00f1os], ''La Capital'', 27 Mar 2012</ref>\n\nFootball had been introduced many years ago in both countries, being the first game played in Argentina on June 20, 1867,<ref>[https://www.clarin.com/deportes/futbol/siglo-medio-primer-partido-futbol-argentina-sudamerica_0_Sy4a5eLXb.html A un siglo y medio del primer partido de f\u00fatbol en la Argentina y en Sudam\u00e9rica] by Oscar Barnade, ''Clar\u00edn'', 20 Jun 2017</ref> with the establishment of [[Buenos Aires Football Club]], the first football club not only in Argentina but in South America.<ref name=iwa/><ref name=yametti>''Historia de F\u00fatbol de AFA: Or\u00edgenes 1891/1899'', by Carlos Yametti.

Argentina organised its first league championship, [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], in [[1891 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1891]] while its [[Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Uruguayan homonymous]] held its first championship in [[1900 Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1900]].\n\nBoth countries considered themselves rivals due to their proximity. Moreover, they had the only organised bodies in South America and had held some earlier competitions such as [[Tie Cup]] (1900) or [[Copa de Honor Cousenier]] (1905), played by champions of each association.\n\nIn some cases, the influence of British clubs on Argentine football extended to the colours adopted by some clubs. Ar\u00edstides Langone, president of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente]], was so impressed by the Nottingham Forest squad that beat local Alumni by 6\u20130 that he suggested to change the jersey colours from white and blue to red. The request was approved and Independiente adopted the colour that would later become an identity mark for the club, being known as ''El Rojo (The Red)''.<ref>[https://www.ole.com.ar/independiente/Independiente-Nottingham-Forest-unidos-siempre_0_324567670.html Independiente y Nottingham Forest unidos para siempre] on ''Ol\u00e9'', 27 Aug 2010</ref>\n\nSome versions also state that Quilmes A.C. was another institution that took the colours from a British squad, in this case the white jersey with blue details of the [[England national football team|English national team]], although there is no evidence to prove that statement.\n\n== Tours ==\n[[Southampton F.C.]] was the first foreign club to tour South America, followed by [[Nottingham Forest F.C.]] in 1905. One of its games, against [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] in Buenos Aires, was attended by 10,000 spectators, what proves the interest of Argentine fans to see the local forces facing British sides, considered technically superior by them.<ref name=soccer/>\n\nThe first team to defeat a British side was Argentine Alumni, who defeated the [[South Africa national football team|South Africa team]] (mostly composed of British\u2013origin players) by 1\u20130 at [[Sociedad Sportiva Argentina]] stadium in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. The relevance of the victory was expressed by local media, such as ''[[La Naci\u00f3n (newspaper)|La Naci\u00f3n]]'' writing: \"For our national football, the Alumni v South Africa match was a great triumph that will be remembered for a long time in everyone's memory, serving as example and stimulus for the future\", while British-origin newspaper ''The Standard'' wrote \"it was a glorious victory and what happened in La Sportiva is promising for Argentine football\".<ref name=southafrica>[https://www.clarin.com/deportes/cien-anos-triunfazo_0_B1RatEyAYl.html A cien a\u00f1os de un triunfazo] on ''Clar\u00edn'', 24 June 2006</ref>\n\n[[Corinthian F.C.]] of [[London]] was the first British club to tour [[Brazil]] in 1910, playing ten games in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Sao Paulo]].

After a half hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that [[Patsy Corcoran]] would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another [[pitch invasion]]. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell who took it himself and scored.

suspended public and private school classes for the week of March 16, as well as all large-scale public gatherings.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, at approximately 8pm AST, Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes announced that there would be a lockdown on all inbound international travel commencing at midnight of March 16, 2020 and ending on March 31, 2020. An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time. To this date Aruba had two confirmed Corona Virus cases. It is important to note that this lockdown does not apply to outbound travel for international travelers currently in Aruba \u2013 they will be able to take their return flight home.\n\nOn March 16 to 17th the 3rd case of the coronavirus was reported, a doctor who recently travelled to New York for her vacation. She did not show any symptoms, but was tested, and the results of the test showed she was positive for the virus.\n\nMarch 17, 2020 \u2013 Fourth case of coronavirus announced. Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes has just announced a fourth case of COVID-19 coronavirus in Aruba. The person who tested positive for the coronavirus is a tourist.\n\nMarch 20, 2020 \u2013 Fifth case of coronavirus announced. The patient is an employee of the airport, who arrived back from New York, where he was on vacation. This was discovered a day after there was public protest over the lack of measures on the airport to protect employees against contagion.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=24 luchthavenmedewerkers uit voorzorg in quarantaine|date=March 20, 2020|work=Amigoe Aruba|access-date=|url-status=live|publisher=Amigoe}}</ref>\n\nMarch 21, 2020 \u2013 Three more cases have been announced, bringing the total to eight.

suspended public and private school classes for the week of March 16, as well as all large-scale public gatherings.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, at approximately 8pm AST, Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes announced that there would be a lockdown on all inbound international travel commencing at midnight of March 16, 2020 and ending on March 31, 2020. An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time. To this date Aruba had two confirmed Corona Virus cases. It is important to note that this lockdown does not apply to outbound travel for international travelers currently in Aruba \u2013 they will be able to take their return flight home.\n\nOn March 16 to 17th the 3rd case of the coronavirus was reported, a doctor who recently travelled to New York for her vacation. She did not show any symptoms, but was tested, and the results of the test showed she was positive for the virus.\n\nMarch 17, 2020 \u2013 Fourth case of coronavirus announced. Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes has just announced a fourth case of COVID-19 coronavirus in Aruba. The person who tested positive for the coronavirus is a tourist.\n\nMarch 20, 2020 \u2013 Fifth case of coronavirus announced. The patient is an employee of the airport, who arrived back from New York, where he was on vacation. This was discovered a day after there was public protest over the lack of measures on the airport to protect employees against contagion.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=24 luchthavenmedewerkers uit voorzorg in quarantaine|date=March 20, 2020|work=Amigoe Aruba|access-date=|url-status=live|publisher=Amigoe}}</ref>\n\nMarch 21, 2020 \u2013 Three more cases have been announced, bringing the total to eight.

It is not far from the western end of the [[Edersee]] in the southwest of the ''Waldecker Land''. Bordering on the west is the ''Medebacher Bucht'', or Medebach Bight, although this is not a [[bight (geography)|bight]] in the conventional sense, being dry land. Bordering on the south is the Breite Struth (hills).\n\nThe municipal area, across which the town's outlying centres are broadly scattered, is crossed by the rivers Orke and Aar. In the northeast, it borders on the Itter Valley, in the east on the [[Eder]] Valley, beyond which rises the [[Kellerwald]] range, and in the south on the Nuhne Valley.\n\n=== Extent of municipal area ===\nWith its area of nearly 100&nbsp;km\u00b2, almost 40% of which is wooded, Lichtenfels is among the largest and most wooded municipalities in the district.\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nLichtenfels borders in the north on the town of [[Korbach]], in the east on the community of [[V\u00f6hl]], in the south on the town of [[Frankenberg, Hesse|Frankenberg]] (all in Waldeck-Frankenberg), and in the west on the towns of [[Hallenberg]] and [[Medebach]] (both in the [[Hochsauerlandkreis]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]).\n\n== Constituent communities ==\nThe town of Lichtenfels was made up from six communities and two towns: Dalwigksthal, F\u00fcrstenberg, Goddelsheim, Immighausen, M\u00fcnden, Neukirchen, Rhadern and Sachsenberg.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1971, as part of municipal reforms, the eight formerly independent municipalities joined together to form a new, greater municipality, choosing the name Lichtenfels after the castle, the oldest noble seat in Waldeck.\n\n=== Dalwigksthal ===\n[[File:Castle lichtenfels small.jpg|thumb|Castle Lichtenfels]]\nFor a long time after the Castle Lichtenfels was built high above the Orke about 800 years ago, almost nobody gave Dalwigksthal any thought. Lichtenfels's newest constituent community celebrated 150 years of existence in 2001. As a result of the Waldeck Law of 24 January 1851, the estates of Kampf, Sand and Lichtenfels as well as the settlements and [[gristmill|mill]]s found there were merged into the village of Dalwigksthal.\n\nHowever, there is tell of a valley community in this place in the [[Middle Ages]] named Eisenbeck from the 14th century to the late 18th century. In 1598, this is recorded as Ensenbecke. The Castle Lichtenfels was built in 1189 by the Abbot of [[Corvey]]. Shortly thereafter, it was destroyed, but built anew between 1223 and 1230. On 21 July 1267, Corvey pledged to Count Adolf of Waldeck, among other things, Schloss Lichtenfels (the castle). After fierce feuds, Corvey had to pass entitlement to the castle's ownership to Count Otto of Waldeck for good in 1297.\n\nThe Archbishop of [[Cologne]], as Duke of [[Westphalia]], raised claim to the places M\u00fcnden, Neukirchen and Rhadern in the ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of Lichtenfels, which in the 16th and 17th centuries led to protracted trials and battles. In the course of these disagreements, the castle is assumed to have once again been destroyed early in the 17th century. A partial reconstruction was done in 1631, with a broader plan carried out between 1908 and 1914. In the late 1980s, an entrepreneurial family bought the castle, which by then was once again falling into disrepair and gave it a comprehensive makeover. Dalwigksthal's church, which for ages had belonged to the parish of M\u00fcnden, is now part of the parish of Sachsenberg. Once, the chapel was a burying ground for the von Dalwigk family. Not much remains of the mediaeval chapel; only the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] is still preserved, likely built early in the 14th century. The current nave was newly built in 1620.\n\nLichtenfels's smallest constituent community has roughly 200 inhabitants.\n\n=== Goddelsheim ===\nGoddelsheim with its roughly 1,450 inhabitants is the biggest of Lichtenfels's constituent communities. The village lies 70&nbsp;km southwest of Kassel. It is about 25&nbsp;km east to the [[Edersee]] (dam) by road. The district seat of Korbach is roughly 10&nbsp;km away. In 1988, Goddelsheim celebrated the village's 1100th anniversary of documentary mention. From one of King Arnulf's documents from 888 comes the first mention of Goddelsheim, but presumably, its history goes much further back. Witness to this is the discovery of some forgotten graves in the area that date back much earlier than the 9th century.\n\nThings have not always been as peaceful in Goddelsheim as they are today. For instance, in 1548 and 1627, the Electors of Cologne tried to introduce the [[Catholic]] faith into the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] village by force. Thanks to the resistance of the Schaaken Monastery, which held the patronage rights to Goddelsheim, the Electors' plans fell through.\n\nOf the formerly three noble estates in the village, the last was divided up in 1904. Nevertheless, [[agriculture]] still plays a r\u00f4le. Furthermore, there are shops, handicraft businesses, a [[bank]] and a savings bank. Many people who live in Goddelsheim do not actually work there, but commute to jobs in Korbach or Frankenberg. Eleven clubs offer a variety of leisure activities. Goddelsheim is not only the biggest constituent community but also the seat of the town's administration. It has a church [[kindergarten]], a [[primary school]] and Lichtenfels's central school (''Mittelpunktschule'').\n\n=== Immighausen ===\nThe place that is now Lichtenfels's constituent community of Immighausen first came to history's attention about 850 when Countess Ida transferred her goods near ''Ymminchusen'' to [[Corvey Abbey]]. There are documents beginning in 1028. Over the ages the place has had many names, with its original name being recorded as Yraminchusen, followed by a succession of other forms: Ymmichusen (about 1190), Immyngchusen (about 1200), Ymenchusen (1336), Imminchusen (about 1350), Immickhusen (1422), Imminckhausen (1537) and Immeckusen (1541). History records that in 1028 a farm at Imminghusen<!--not a mistake--> was transferred by the Abbot of Corvey, at [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad's]] behest, to the dowager Alvered's son. In 1189 the place was a Corvey [[fief]] under the Counts of Waldeck. The church at Immighausen was first mentioned in 1223 as being a chapel among the Schaaken Monastery's estates. The church has a square tower and a single nave. Immighausen is shaped by agriculture, but there is industry. The oldest club is the 110-year-old men's singing club \"Liedertafel\". Furthermore, there are the women's choir, the ''Landfrauen'', the sport club with its subgroup the \"Klosterm\u00f6nche\" (\"Monastery Monks\") and the fire brigade. The Lichtenfels regional group of the Waldeck History Club (''Waldeckischer Geschichtsverein'') also has its seat in Immighausen. In the village live 402 people.\n\n=== Rhadern ===\nWith roughly 370 inhabitants, Rhadern is the smallest of Lichtenfels's constituent communities. Its first documentary mention came in 1473, though already about 830, history mentions something about a place called Ryadra. Over the ages, Rhadern has had a number of different names. About 1020 the village was called Radirinhusen, about 1125, Rotheren. In 1336 when Count Heinrich of Waldeck pledged, among other things, this village to Count Johann of Nassau as a [[dowry]] for his daughter, it was called Rodern. Later names for it were Raderen (about 1350), Radehausen (1420) and R\u00e4dern (1738). In 1473, when Rhadern had its first documentary mention, the village was deserted. It was at this time that the von Dalwigk family were granted the forsaken hamlet along with the rest of the ''Amt'' of Lichtenfels as a fief. As of this time, Rhadern belonged to the ''Amt'' and the von Dalwigk ''[[League of the Holy Court|Freistuhl]]'' of Lichtenfels. The chapel lying on the way out of the village towards F\u00fcrstenberg was separated from its mother church in 1260 and raised to a [[parish]] in its own right. Owing to the church's destruction, the community was parochially united with F\u00fcrstenberg in the 15th century. Rhadern parishioners even had their own entrance to the church there, and their own pews. About 1700, the community was parochially united with M\u00fcnden. Once the chapel had been built anew in 1755, Rhadern once again had its own church, which was expanded in the 1970s. The centre of the small chapel is a winged [[altar]]. The villagers are kept busy as members of various clubs, there being, besides the [[fire brigade]] and the Lichtenfels sporting community a music club with various subgroups, the \"Discoteam\" and the ''Landfrauen'' (\"Country Women\") with a dance group.\n\n=== Neukirchen ===\nUp the Nuhne at the boundary with Rengershausen was a village or farm called \"Aweshausen\" or \"Auweshausen\". The field names in the area, \"Auf der Aue\" and \"Auf der Junkernaue\" recall the former centre. In 1336, Count Heinrich IV of Waldeck pledged, among other things, the village of ''Nuwenkyrchen'' to Count Johann of Nassau as a dowry for his daughter (see also Rhadern above), which also gave Neukirchen its first documentary mention. Already by 1301, though, history records a Ditmar von Nuwenkyrchen, Juryman at Sachsenberg, proof that there had already been a settlement there for some time before the Count's daughter's wedding. In the disputes between the Electors of Cologne and Waldeck, which had begun in 1533, the Elector of Cologne claimed, among other properties, Neukirchen. By 1663, however, Cologne had forgone its claim to the village, thus also bringing an end to the Electors' attempts to reintroduce the Catholic faith into the community. Neukirchen was a branch of the parish of M\u00fcnden and in the 18th century temporarily a parish in its own right. Today it belongs to the parish of Sachsenberg. The church with its rectangular nave was newly built in 1864 by the master mason G\u00fclich from Sachsenberg where an older forerunner church had once stood which had to be torn down. How the church looked before the new building was put up is not known with any certainty, as there are no reliable indications. The first new church, which was the village's namesake (Neukirchen&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;new church), must have been built sometime before 1336 \u2013 the time of Neukirchen's first documentary mention \u2013 but a more precise indication of its building date is not possible.\n\nThe first part of what is today Neukirchen arose as a scattered village \u2013 one with an irregular layout \u2013 and nowadays forms the upper village. It was purely a farming community, and by all indications arose from a lordly estate. By and by arose also the lower village as a thorpe, or [[linear village]]. It harboured day labourers, workers and craftsmen. The schoolhouse was built in 1785. After the [[Second World War]], a bigger school was built, which was closed in 1976. In this village, shaped by agriculture, live 488 people. Many of them are active in the five clubs.\n\n=== M\u00fcnden ===\nIn 1028, Emperor Konrad acknowledged that the Abbot of [[Corvey Abbey]] had given the dowager Alvered the estate at ''Gimundia'' for her lifelong use, thereby giving M\u00fcnden its first documentary mention. Late in the 13th century, Corvey Abbey pledged the ''Amt'' of M\u00fcnden to Count Otto of Waldeck. In a disagreement between Corvey and the Counts of Waldeck, M\u00fcnden was awarded to the Counts in 1321 through arbitration. M\u00fcnden, too, was included in Count Heinrich IV's pledge to Count Johann of Nassau as part of the former's daughter Elisabeth's dowry (see also Rhadern and Neukirchen above). As of 1473, M\u00fcnden, which until then had been seat of a Corvey and later Waldeck ''Amt'', belonged to the von Dalwigk ''Amt'' of Lichtenfels. In the disputes between the Electors of Cologne and Waldeck, Cologne also claimed M\u00fcnden. However, as with Neukirchen, the Electors forwent their claim in 1663.\n\nToday, M\u00fcnden, lying between Dalwigksthal and Medebach in Westphalia, belongs to Lichtenfels as a constituent community. Earlier names for the village besides ''Gimundia'' were ''Gemundi'' (1120), ''Gimunden'' (1125), ''Munden'' (1298), ''Gemonden'' (1321), ''Gemunden'' (1336, 1473) and ''Dreckm\u00fcnden'' (1679). The village lies about 1&nbsp;500&nbsp;m from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and is home to about 420 people.\n\n=== F\u00fcrstenberg ===\nF\u00fcrstenberg, once Waldeck's and Hesse's smallest town, was first mentioned as a town in 1254. Remains of the old town wall can still be seen in the historic town core. This little town in the ''Waldecker Land'' is wrapped in many stories and sagas. One of them is the Hedgehog Saga (''Igelsage'') which has also given the town the name \"Igelstadt\". It says that a [[hedgehog]] kept Count Heinrich of Waldeck from coming a cropper when his horse shied before it. To this day, the ''Igelfest'' (Hedgehog Festival) is still celebrated in F\u00fcrstenberg on the Monday before Whitsun.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Town council ===\n{{update|section|date=June 2015}}\nThe town council's 23 seats are apportioned thus, in accordance with municipal elections held on 26 March 2006:\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:300px; text-align:right; white-space:nowrap;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] || 8 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || 7 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || 4 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | WGL || 3 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Unabh\u00e4ngig Pro Lichtenfels || 1 seat\n|}\n<small>Note: The last two named are citizens' coalitions.</small>\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n* Castle Lichtenfels\n* Schloss Reckenberg (stately home)\n* Schaaken Monastery ruins\n\n=== F\u00fcrstenberg ===\n* Village shop\n* Nordic walking school\n* \"Nordic walking paradise\"\n* Nature study diorama\n* [[Sebastian Kneipp|Kneipp]] centre\n\n=== Sachsenberg ===\n*Village pond\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Lichtenfels (Hessen)}}\n*[http://dalwigksthal.de/ Dalwigksthal]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050829230716/http://www.lichtenfels-neukirchen.de/ Neukirchen]\n*{{dmoz|World/Deutsch/Regional/Europa/Deutschland/Hessen/Landkreise/Waldeck-Frankenberg/St\u00e4dte_und_Gemeinden/Lichtenfels,_Hessen|Lichtenfels}}\n\n{{Towns and municipalities in Waldeck-Frankenberg district}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Waldeck-Frankenberg]]\n[[Category:Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox German location \n|type = town\n|name = Lichtenfels\n|name_local =\n|image_coa = Wappen Lichtenfels (Hessen).svg\n|image_photo = Lichtenfels-Neukirchen Sauerland Ost 263 pk.jpg\n|image_caption = Aerial photograph (2013)\n|image_plan = Lichtenfels in KB.svg\n|state = Hesse\n|regbzk = [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]]\n|district = [[Waldeck-Frankenberg]]\n|population = 4925\n|population_as_of = {{date|2006-01-01}}<ref>http://www.stadt-lichtenfels.de/</ref>\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 06635016\n|area = 96.73\n|elevation = 410\n|coordinates = {{coord|51|9|0|N|8|48|0|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code = 35104\n|area_code = 05636\n|licence = KB\n|mayor = Uwe Steuber (independent)\n|website = [http://www.stadt-lichtenfels.de/ Stadt Lichtenfels]\n}}\n'''Lichtenfels''' is a small town in [[Waldeck-Frankenberg]] district in northwest [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nLichtenfels lies at the northeast foot of the [[Rothaargebirge]], some {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Kassel]]. It is not far from the western end of the [[Edersee]] in the southwest of the ''Waldecker Land''. Bordering on the west is the ''Medebacher Bucht'', or Medebach Bight, although this is not a [[bight (geography)|bight]] in the conventional sense, being dry land. Bordering on the south is the Breite Struth (hills).\n\nThe municipal area, across which the town's outlying centres are broadly scattered, is crossed by the rivers Orke and Aar. In the northeast, it borders on the Itter Valley, in the east on the [[Eder]] Valley, beyond which rises the [[Kellerwald]] range, and in the south on the Nuhne Valley.\n\n=== Extent of municipal area ===\nWith its area of nearly 100&nbsp;km\u00b2, almost 40% of which is wooded, Lichtenfels is among the largest and most wooded municipalities in the district.\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nLichtenfels borders in the north on the town of [[Korbach]], in the east on the community of [[V\u00f6hl]], in the south on the town of [[Frankenberg, Hesse|Frankenberg]] (all in Waldeck-Frankenberg), and in the west on the towns of [[Hallenberg]] and [[Medebach]] (both in the [[Hochsauerlandkreis]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]).\n\n== Constituent communities ==\nThe town of Lichtenfels was made up from six communities and two towns: Dalwigksthal, F\u00fcrstenberg, Goddelsheim, Immighausen, M\u00fcnden, Neukirchen, Rhadern and Sachsenberg.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1971, as part of municipal reforms, the eight formerly independent municipalities joined together to form a new, greater municipality, choosing the name Lichtenfels after the castle, the oldest noble seat in Waldeck.\n\n=== Dalwigksthal ===\n[[File:Castle lichtenfels small.jpg|thumb|Castle Lichtenfels]]\nFor a long time after the Castle Lichtenfels was built high above the Orke about 800 years ago, almost nobody gave Dalwigksthal any thought. Lichtenfels's newest constituent community celebrated 150 years of existence in 2001. As a result of the Waldeck Law of 24 January 1851, the estates of Kampf, Sand and Lichtenfels as well as the settlements and [[gristmill|mill]]s found there were merged into the village of Dalwigksthal.\n\nHowever, there is tell of a valley community in this place in the [[Middle Ages]] named Eisenbeck from the 14th century to the late 18th century. In 1598, this is recorded as Ensenbecke. The Castle Lichtenfels was built in 1189 by the Abbot of [[Corvey]]. Shortly thereafter, it was destroyed, but built anew between 1223 and 1230. On 21 July 1267, Corvey pledged to Count Adolf of Waldeck, among other things, Schloss Lichtenfels (the castle). After fierce feuds, Corvey had to pass entitlement to the castle's ownership to Count Otto of Waldeck for good in 1297.\n\nThe Archbishop of [[Cologne]], as Duke of [[Westphalia]], raised claim to the places M\u00fcnden, Neukirchen and Rhadern in the ''[[Amt (subnational entity)|Amt]]'' of Lichtenfels, which in the 16th and 17th centuries led to protracted trials and battles. In the course of these disagreements, the castle is assumed to have once again been destroyed early in the 17th century. A partial reconstruction was done in 1631, with a broader plan carried out between 1908 and 1914. In the late 1980s, an entrepreneurial family bought the castle, which by then was once again falling into disrepair and gave it a comprehensive makeover. Dalwigksthal's church, which for ages had belonged to the parish of M\u00fcnden, is now part of the parish of Sachsenberg. Once, the chapel was a burying ground for the von Dalwigk family. Not much remains of the mediaeval chapel; only the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|quire]] is still preserved, likely built early in the 14th century. The current nave was newly built in 1620.\n\nLichtenfels's smallest constituent community has roughly 200 inhabitants.\n\n=== Goddelsheim ===\nGoddelsheim with its roughly 1,450 inhabitants is the biggest of Lichtenfels's constituent communities. The village lies 70&nbsp;km southwest of Kassel. It is about 25&nbsp;km east to the [[Edersee]] (dam) by road. The district seat of Korbach is roughly 10&nbsp;km away. In 1988, Goddelsheim celebrated the village's 1100th anniversary of documentary mention. From one of King Arnulf's documents from 888 comes the first mention of Goddelsheim, but presumably, its history goes much further back. Witness to this is the discovery of some forgotten graves in the area that date back much earlier than the 9th century.\n\nThings have not always been as peaceful in Goddelsheim as they are today. For instance, in 1548 and 1627, the Electors of Cologne tried to introduce the [[Catholic]] faith into the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] village by force. Thanks to the resistance of the Schaaken Monastery, which held the patronage rights to Goddelsheim, the Electors' plans fell through.\n\nOf the formerly three noble estates in the village, the last was divided up in 1904. Nevertheless, [[agriculture]] still plays a r\u00f4le. Furthermore, there are shops, handicraft businesses, a [[bank]] and a savings bank. Many people who live in Goddelsheim do not actually work there, but commute to jobs in Korbach or Frankenberg. Eleven clubs offer a variety of leisure activities. Goddelsheim is not only the biggest constituent community but also the seat of the town's administration. It has a church [[kindergarten]], a [[primary school]] and Lichtenfels's central school (''Mittelpunktschule'').\n\n=== Immighausen ===\nThe place that is now Lichtenfels's constituent community of Immighausen first came to history's attention about 850 when Countess Ida transferred her goods near ''Ymminchusen'' to [[Corvey Abbey]]. There are documents beginning in 1028. Over the ages the place has had many names, with its original name being recorded as Yraminchusen, followed by a succession of other forms: Ymmichusen (about 1190), Immyngchusen (about 1200), Ymenchusen (1336), Imminchusen (about 1350), Immickhusen (1422), Imminckhausen (1537) and Immeckusen (1541). History records that in 1028 a farm at Imminghusen<!--not a mistake--> was transferred by the Abbot of Corvey, at [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad's]] behest, to the dowager Alvered's son. In 1189 the place was a Corvey [[fief]] under the Counts of Waldeck. The church at Immighausen was first mentioned in 1223 as being a chapel among the Schaaken Monastery's estates. The church has a square tower and a single nave. Immighausen is shaped by agriculture, but there is industry. The oldest club is the 110-year-old men's singing club \"Liedertafel\". Furthermore, there are the women's choir, the ''Landfrauen'', the sport club with its subgroup the \"Klosterm\u00f6nche\" (\"Monastery Monks\") and the fire brigade. The Lichtenfels regional group of the Waldeck History Club (''Waldeckischer Geschichtsverein'') also has its seat in Immighausen. In the village live 402 people.\n\n=== Rhadern ===\nWith roughly 370 inhabitants, Rhadern is the smallest of Lichtenfels's constituent communities. Its first documentary mention came in 1473, though already about 830, history mentions something about a place called Ryadra. Over the ages, Rhadern has had a number of different names. About 1020 the village was called Radirinhusen, about 1125, Rotheren. In 1336 when Count Heinrich of Waldeck pledged, among other things, this village to Count Johann of Nassau as a [[dowry]] for his daughter, it was called Rodern. Later names for it were Raderen (about 1350), Radehausen (1420) and R\u00e4dern (1738). In 1473, when Rhadern had its first documentary mention, the village was deserted. It was at this time that the von Dalwigk family were granted the forsaken hamlet along with the rest of the ''Amt'' of Lichtenfels as a fief. As of this time, Rhadern belonged to the ''Amt'' and the von Dalwigk ''[[League of the Holy Court|Freistuhl]]'' of Lichtenfels. The chapel lying on the way out of the village towards F\u00fcrstenberg was separated from its mother church in 1260 and raised to a [[parish]] in its own right. Owing to the church's destruction, the community was parochially united with F\u00fcrstenberg in the 15th century. Rhadern parishioners even had their own entrance to the church there, and their own pews. About 1700, the community was parochially united with M\u00fcnden. Once the chapel had been built anew in 1755, Rhadern once again had its own church, which was expanded in the 1970s. The centre of the small chapel is a winged [[altar]]. The villagers are kept busy as members of various clubs, there being, besides the [[fire brigade]] and the Lichtenfels sporting community a music club with various subgroups, the \"Discoteam\" and the ''Landfrauen'' (\"Country Women\") with a dance group.\n\n=== Neukirchen ===\nUp the Nuhne at the boundary with Rengershausen was a village or farm called \"Aweshausen\" or \"Auweshausen\". The field names in the area, \"Auf der Aue\" and \"Auf der Junkernaue\" recall the former centre. In 1336, Count Heinrich IV of Waldeck pledged, among other things, the village of ''Nuwenkyrchen'' to Count Johann of Nassau as a dowry for his daughter (see also Rhadern above), which also gave Neukirchen its first documentary mention. Already by 1301, though, history records a Ditmar von Nuwenkyrchen, Juryman at Sachsenberg, proof that there had already been a settlement there for some time before the Count's daughter's wedding. In the disputes between the Electors of Cologne and Waldeck, which had begun in 1533, the Elector of Cologne claimed, among other properties, Neukirchen. By 1663, however, Cologne had forgone its claim to the village, thus also bringing an end to the Electors' attempts to reintroduce the Catholic faith into the community. Neukirchen was a branch of the parish of M\u00fcnden and in the 18th century temporarily a parish in its own right. Today it belongs to the parish of Sachsenberg. The church with its rectangular nave was newly built in 1864 by the master mason G\u00fclich from Sachsenberg where an older forerunner church had once stood which had to be torn down. How the church looked before the new building was put up is not known with any certainty, as there are no reliable indications. The first new church, which was the village's namesake (Neukirchen&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;new church), must have been built sometime before 1336 \u2013 the time of Neukirchen's first documentary mention \u2013 but a more precise indication of its building date is not possible.\n\nThe first part of what is today Neukirchen arose as a scattered village \u2013 one with an irregular layout \u2013 and nowadays forms the upper village. It was purely a farming community, and by all indications arose from a lordly estate. By and by arose also the lower village as a thorpe, or [[linear village]]. It harboured day labourers, workers and craftsmen. The schoolhouse was built in 1785. After the [[Second World War]], a bigger school was built, which was closed in 1976. In this village, shaped by agriculture, live 488 people. Many of them are active in the five clubs.\n\n=== M\u00fcnden ===\nIn 1028, Emperor Konrad acknowledged that the Abbot of [[Corvey Abbey]] had given the dowager Alvered the estate at ''Gimundia'' for her lifelong use, thereby giving M\u00fcnden its first documentary mention. Late in the 13th century, Corvey Abbey pledged the ''Amt'' of M\u00fcnden to Count Otto of Waldeck. In a disagreement between Corvey and the Counts of Waldeck, M\u00fcnden was awarded to the Counts in 1321 through arbitration. M\u00fcnden, too, was included in Count Heinrich IV's pledge to Count Johann of Nassau as part of the former's daughter Elisabeth's dowry (see also Rhadern and Neukirchen above). As of 1473, M\u00fcnden, which until then had been seat of a Corvey and later Waldeck ''Amt'', belonged to the von Dalwigk ''Amt'' of Lichtenfels. In the disputes between the Electors of Cologne and Waldeck, Cologne also claimed M\u00fcnden. However, as with Neukirchen, the Electors forwent their claim in 1663.\n\nToday, M\u00fcnden, lying between Dalwigksthal and Medebach in Westphalia, belongs to Lichtenfels as a constituent community. Earlier names for the village besides ''Gimundia'' were ''Gemundi'' (1120), ''Gimunden'' (1125), ''Munden'' (1298), ''Gemonden'' (1321), ''Gemunden'' (1336, 1473) and ''Dreckm\u00fcnden'' (1679). The village lies about 1&nbsp;500&nbsp;m from [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and is home to about 420 people.\n\n=== F\u00fcrstenberg ===\nF\u00fcrstenberg, once Waldeck's and Hesse's smallest town, was first mentioned as a town in 1254. Remains of the old town wall can still be seen in the historic town core. This little town in the ''Waldecker Land'' is wrapped in many stories and sagas. One of them is the Hedgehog Saga (''Igelsage'') which has also given the town the name \"Igelstadt\". It says that a [[hedgehog]] kept Count Heinrich of Waldeck from coming a cropper when his horse shied before it. To this day, the ''Igelfest'' (Hedgehog Festival) is still celebrated in F\u00fcrstenberg on the Monday before Whitsun.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Town council ===\n{{update|section|date=June 2015}}\nThe town council's 23 seats are apportioned thus, in accordance with municipal elections held on 26 March 2006:\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:300px; text-align:right; white-space:nowrap;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] || 8 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || 7 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] || 4 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | WGL || 3 seats \n|- \n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Unabh\u00e4ngig Pro Lichtenfels || 1 seat\n|}\n<small>Note: The last two named are citizens' coalitions.</small>\n\n== Culture and sightseeing ==\n* Castle Lichtenfels\n* Schloss Reckenberg (stately home)\n* Schaaken Monastery ruins\n\n=== F\u00fcrstenberg ===\n* Village shop\n* Nordic walking school\n* \"Nordic walking paradise\"\n* Nature study diorama\n* [[Sebastian Kneipp|Kneipp]] centre\n\n=== Sachsenberg ===\n*Village pond\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Lichtenfels (Hessen)}}\n*[http://dalwigksthal.de/ Dalwigksthal]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050829230716/http://www.lichtenfels-neukirchen.de/ Neukirchen]\n*{{dmoz|World/Deutsch/Regional/Europa/Deutschland/Hessen/Landkreise/Waldeck-Frankenberg/St\u00e4dte_und_Gemeinden/Lichtenfels,_Hessen|Lichtenfels}}\n\n{{Towns and municipalities in Waldeck-Frankenberg district}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Waldeck-Frankenberg]]\n[[Category:Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtenfels,_Hesse"}
