A '''rip''' is the extracted content, in its destination [[Content format|format]], along with accompanying files, such as a [[cue sheet (computing)|cue sheet]] or [[Computer data logging|log file]] from the ripping software.\n\nTo rip the contents out of a container is different from simply [[file copying|copying]] the whole container or a file. When creating a copy, nothing looks into the transferred file, nor checks if there is any encryption or not, and raw copy is also not aware of any file format. One can copy a DVD byte by byte via programs like [[dd (Unix software)#Uses|the Linux dd]] command onto a hard disk, and play the resulting [[ISO image|ISO file]] just as one would play the original DVD.\n\nTo rip contents is also different from grabbing an analog signal and re-encoding it, as it was done with early day [[CD-ROM]] drives not capable of digital audio extraction (DAE). Sometimes even encoding, i.e. [[digitizing]] audio and video originally stored on [[Analog recording|analog formats]], such as [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] is incorrectly referred to as ripping.\n\n== Ripping software ==\n\nA [[CD ripper]], CD grabber or CD extractor is a piece of software designed to extract or \"rip\" raw digital audio (in format commonly called CDDA) from a compact disc to a file or other output. Some all-in-one ripping programs can simplify the entire process by ripping and burning the audio to disc in one step, possibly re-encoding the audio on-the-fly in the process.\n\nFor example, audio CDs contain 16-bit, 44.1&nbsp;kHz [[Linear pulse-code modulation|LPCM]]-encoded audio samples interleaved with secondary data streams and synchronization and error correction info. The ripping software tells the CD drive's [[firmware]] to read this data and parse out just the LPCM samples. The software then dumps them into a [[WAV]] or [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] file, or feeds them to another [[codec]] to produce, for example, a [[FLAC]] or [[MP3]] file. Depending on the capabilities of the ripping software, ripping may be done on a track-by-track basis, or all tracks at once, or over a custom range. The ripping software may also have facilities for detecting and correcting errors during or after the rip, as the process is not always reliable, especially when the CD or the drive containing the CD itself is damaged or defective.\n\nThere are also [[Comparison of DVD ripper software|DVD ripper]]s which operate in a similar fashion. Unlike CDs, DVDs do contain data formatted in files for use in computers. However, commercial DVDs are often [[Encryption|encrypted]] (for example, using [[Content Scramble System]]/ARccOS Protection), preventing access to the files without using the ripping software's decryption ability, which may not be legal to distribute or use. DVD files are often larger than is convenient to distribute or copy to [[CD-R]] or ordinary (not dual-layer) [[DVD-R]], so DVD ripping software usually offers the ability to re-encode the content, with some quality loss, so that it fits in smaller files.\n\n==Legality==\n{{see also|Legal aspects of file sharing}}\nWhen the material being ripped is not in the [[public domain]], and the person making the rip does not have the copyright owner's permission, then such ripping may be regarded as [[copyright infringement]]. However, some countries either explicitly allow it in certain circumstances, or at least don't forbid it. Some countries also have [[fair use]]-type laws which allow unauthorized copies to be made under certain conditions. As mentioned above, circumventing copy protection mechanisms, such as the encryption used on most commercial DVDs, may also be illegal in many countries.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{Empty section|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nA directive of the European Union allows its member nations to instate in their legal framework a ''private copy'' exception to the authors and editors rights. If a member State chooses to do so, it must also introduce a compensation for the copyright holders. Most European countries, except for Norway, have introduced a private copying levy that compensates the owners directly from the country's budget. In 2009 the sum awarded to them was $55 million. In all but a few of these countries (exceptions include the UK and Malta), the levy is excised on all machines and blank materials capable of copying copyrighted works.\n\nUnder the directive, making copies for other people is forbidden, and if done for profit can lead to a jail sentence.\n\n==== Netherlands ====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], citizens are allowed to make copies of their legally bought audio and video. This contains for example [[CD]], [[Super Audio CD|SACD]], as well as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. These copies are called \"home copies\" and may only be used by the ripper. Public distribution of ripped files is not allowed.\n\n====Spain====\nIn [[Spain]], anyone is allowed to make a private copy of a copyrighted material for oneself, providing that the copier has accessed the original material legally.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nPrivate copying of copyrighted material is illegal in the United Kingdom.<ref name=ars-privatecopyinggone/> According to a 2009 survey, 59% of British consumers believed ripping a CD to be legal, and 55% admitted to doing it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8000876.stm|title=UK 'has the worst copyright laws'|last=|first=|date=2009-04-15|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/en/content/cms/News___Press/UK_has_worst_copyrig/UK_has_worst_copyrig.aspx|title=UK has worst copyright laws \u2013 'by far'|last=|first=|date=28 July 2009|work=|accessdate=29 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523081313/http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/en/content/cms/News___Press/UK_has_worst_copyrig/UK_has_worst_copyrig.aspx|archive-date=May 23, 2009|publisher=[[Consumer Focus]]}}</ref> \n\nIn 2010, the UK government sought input on modernizing copyright exceptions for the digital age, and commissioned the ''[[Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth]]''. The review asserted that a private copying exception was overdue, citing that users were unaware of what was even legally allowed, and that a copyright law where \"millions of citizens are in daily breach of copyright, simply for shifting a piece of music or video from one device to another\" was not \"fit for the digital age\".<ref name=Hargreaves/> The review recommended, among other things, that the government consider adopting the EU [[Copyright Directive]]'s recommendation that member states enact an exception for private, noncommercial copying so long as the rights holders receive \"fair compensation.\" Other EU member states chose to implement the exception paired with a tax on music purchases or widely varying levies on copying equipment and blank media.<ref name=Hargreaves/><ref name=\"Impact\">{{cite web|url=https://ipo.gov.uk/ia-exception-privatecopy.pdf|title=Impact Assessment: Copyright Exception for Private Copying|last=|first=|date=13 Dec 2012|website=|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328013158if_/http://www.ipo.gov.uk//ia-exception-privatecopy.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-28|access-date=}}</ref> However, the Review reasoned that no such collections are necessary when implementing a copyright exception for format-shifting:\n\n{{quote|The UK has a thriving market for personal media devices which rely on private copying.

We are not aware of strong evidence of harm to rights holders done by this kind of private copying in the normal course of using digital equipment to play works. There is considerable evidence of overall public benefits from consumer use. [...] The Review favours a limited private copying exception which corresponds to what consumers are already doing. As rights holders are well aware of consumers\u2019 behaviour in this respect, our view is that the benefit of being able to do this is already factored into the price that rights holders are charging.

For example, [[space shifting]], by making a copy of a personally owned audio CD for transfer to an MP3 player for that person's personal use, is not explicitly allowed or forbidden.\n\nExisting copyright statutes ''may'' apply to specific acts of personal copying, as determined in cases in the civil or criminal court systems, building up a body of [[case law]].

However, 17 USC 1008, the relevant text of the legislation, didn't fully indemnify consumers for noncommercial, private copying. Such copying is broadly permitted using analog devices and media, but digital copying is only permitted with certain technology like DAT, MiniDisc, and \"audio\" CD-R\u2014not with computer hard drives, portable media players, and general-purpose CD-Rs.\n\nThe AHRA was partially tested in ''RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia, Inc.'',<ref>180 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1999).</ref> a late-1990s case which broached the subject of a consumer's right to copy and format-shift, but which ultimately only ascertained that one of the first portable MP3 players wasn't even a \"digital recording device\" covered by the law, so its maker wasn't required to pay royalties to the recording industry under other terms of the AHRA.\n\nStatements made by the court in that case, and by both the House and Senate in committee reports about the AHRA, do interpret the legislation as being intended to permit private, noncommercial copying with any digital technology. However, these interpretations may not be binding.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), a government office which requires business to engage in consumer-friendly trade practices, has acknowledged that consumers normally expect to be able to rip audio CDs. Specifically, in response to the [[Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal]], the FTC declared that the marketing and sale of audio CDs which surreptitiously installed [[digital rights management]] (DRM) software constituted deceptive and unfair trade practices, in part because the record company \"represented, expressly or by implication, that consumers will be able to use the CDs as they are commonly used on a computer: to listen to, transfer to playback devices, and copy the audio files contained on the CD for personal use.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623019/0623019cmp070629.pdf|title=DOCKET NO.

They are mainly used to transfer video on DVDs to different formats, to edit or back up DVD content, and to convert DVD video for playback on media players and mobile devices. Some DVD rippers include additional features such as [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] support, DVD and Blu-ray Disc decryption, [[Digital rights management|copy protection]] removal and the ability to make discs unrestricted and [[Regional lockout|region-free]].  While most DVD rippers only convert video to highly compressed [[MP4]] video files, there are other rippers that can convert DVDs to higher quality compressed video.  These types of DVD rippers are used by the television and film industry to create broadcast quality video from DVD.  Video ripped by these professional DVD rippers is an exact duplicate of the original DVD video.\n\n=== Circumvention of DVD copy protection ===\n\nIn the case where media contents are protected using some ''effective'' [[copy protection]] scheme, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) of 1998 makes it illegal to manufacture or distribute circumvention tools and use those tools for infringing purposes. In the 2009 case ''[[RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc.|RealNetworks v.

One such ruling in 2010 declared, among other things, that the [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) commonly employed on commercial DVDs could be circumvented to enable non-infringing uses of the DVD's content.<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html\n|title=Statement of the Librarian of Congress Relating to Section 1201 Rulemaking\n|publisher=U.S. Copyright Office\n|date=2010-07-23}}</ref> The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) hailed the ruling as enabling DVD excerpts to be used for the well-established fair-use activities of criticism and commentary, and for the creation of derivative works by video remix artists.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2010/07/26 |title=Rulemaking Fixes Critical DMCA Wrongs |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|date=2010-07-26}}</ref> However, the text of the ruling says the exemption can only be exercised by professional educators and their students, not the general public.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[CD ripper]]\n* [[Digital video recorder]]\n* [[Radio music ripping]]\n* [[Digital Rights Management]]\n* [[Telecine (copying)]], a copy of a film created with a telecine.\n* [[Screener (promotional)|DVDScr (DVD Screener)]]\n* [[R5 (bootleg)]]\n* [[Riplock]]\n* [[DVD Decrypter]]\n* [[Comparison of DVD ripper software]]\n* [[.bup|BUP]]\n* [[IFO]]\n* [[DVD authoring]]\n* [[VOB]]\n* [[Pirated movie release types]]\n* [[HandBrake]]\n* [[Blu-ray ripper]]\n* [[List of DVD authoring applications]]\n* [[DVD-Video]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Forms of pirated film releases}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Copyright law]]\n[[Category:Audio storage]]\n[[Category:Ripping]]\n[[Category:Video storage]]\n[[Category:Video conversion software]]\n[[Category:DVD]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|copying digital media||Rip (disambiguation){{!}}Rip}}'''Ripping''' is extracting all or parts of digital contents from a container. Originally it meant to rip music out of [[Amiga]] games. Later the term was used to extract [[WAV]] or [[MP3]] format files from digital [[Sound|audio]][[compact disk| CDs]], but got applied as well to extract the contents of any [[Computer_data_storage#media|media]], most notably [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] discs.\n\nDespite the name, neither the media nor the data is damaged after extraction. Ripping is often used to [[format shifting|shift format]]s, and to edit, duplicate or back up media content. A '''rip''' is the extracted content, in its destination [[Content format|format]], along with accompanying files, such as a [[cue sheet (computing)|cue sheet]] or [[Computer data logging|log file]] from the ripping software.\n\nTo rip the contents out of a container is different from simply [[file copying|copying]] the whole container or a file. When creating a copy, nothing looks into the transferred file, nor checks if there is any encryption or not, and raw copy is also not aware of any file format. One can copy a DVD byte by byte via programs like [[dd (Unix software)#Uses|the Linux dd]] command onto a hard disk, and play the resulting [[ISO image|ISO file]] just as one would play the original DVD.\n\nTo rip contents is also different from grabbing an analog signal and re-encoding it, as it was done with early day [[CD-ROM]] drives not capable of digital audio extraction (DAE). Sometimes even encoding, i.e. [[digitizing]] audio and video originally stored on [[Analog recording|analog formats]], such as [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] is incorrectly referred to as ripping.\n\n== Ripping software ==\n\nA [[CD ripper]], CD grabber or CD extractor is a piece of software designed to extract or \"rip\" raw digital audio (in format commonly called CDDA) from a compact disc to a file or other output. Some all-in-one ripping programs can simplify the entire process by ripping and burning the audio to disc in one step, possibly re-encoding the audio on-the-fly in the process.\n\nFor example, audio CDs contain 16-bit, 44.1&nbsp;kHz [[Linear pulse-code modulation|LPCM]]-encoded audio samples interleaved with secondary data streams and synchronization and error correction info. The ripping software tells the CD drive's [[firmware]] to read this data and parse out just the LPCM samples. The software then dumps them into a [[WAV]] or [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] file, or feeds them to another [[codec]] to produce, for example, a [[FLAC]] or [[MP3]] file. Depending on the capabilities of the ripping software, ripping may be done on a track-by-track basis, or all tracks at once, or over a custom range. The ripping software may also have facilities for detecting and correcting errors during or after the rip, as the process is not always reliable, especially when the CD or the drive containing the CD itself is damaged or defective.\n\nThere are also [[Comparison of DVD ripper software|DVD ripper]]s which operate in a similar fashion. Unlike CDs, DVDs do contain data formatted in files for use in computers. However, commercial DVDs are often [[Encryption|encrypted]] (for example, using [[Content Scramble System]]/ARccOS Protection), preventing access to the files without using the ripping software's decryption ability, which may not be legal to distribute or use. DVD files are often larger than is convenient to distribute or copy to [[CD-R]] or ordinary (not dual-layer) [[DVD-R]], so DVD ripping software usually offers the ability to re-encode the content, with some quality loss, so that it fits in smaller files.\n\n==Legality==\n{{see also|Legal aspects of file sharing}}\nWhen the material being ripped is not in the [[public domain]], and the person making the rip does not have the copyright owner's permission, then such ripping may be regarded as [[copyright infringement]]. However, some countries either explicitly allow it in certain circumstances, or at least don't forbid it. Some countries also have [[fair use]]-type laws which allow unauthorized copies to be made under certain conditions. As mentioned above, circumventing copy protection mechanisms, such as the encryption used on most commercial DVDs, may also be illegal in many countries.\n\n=== Asia ===\n{{Empty section|date=May 2017}}\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nA directive of the European Union allows its member nations to instate in their legal framework a ''private copy'' exception to the authors and editors rights. If a member State chooses to do so, it must also introduce a compensation for the copyright holders. Most European countries, except for Norway, have introduced a private copying levy that compensates the owners directly from the country's budget. In 2009 the sum awarded to them was $55 million. In all but a few of these countries (exceptions include the UK and Malta), the levy is excised on all machines and blank materials capable of copying copyrighted works.\n\nUnder the directive, making copies for other people is forbidden, and if done for profit can lead to a jail sentence.\n\n==== Netherlands ====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], citizens are allowed to make copies of their legally bought audio and video. This contains for example [[CD]], [[Super Audio CD|SACD]], as well as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. These copies are called \"home copies\" and may only be used by the ripper. Public distribution of ripped files is not allowed.\n\n====Spain====\nIn [[Spain]], anyone is allowed to make a private copy of a copyrighted material for oneself, providing that the copier has accessed the original material legally.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nPrivate copying of copyrighted material is illegal in the United Kingdom.<ref name=ars-privatecopyinggone/> According to a 2009 survey, 59% of British consumers believed ripping a CD to be legal, and 55% admitted to doing it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8000876.stm|title=UK 'has the worst copyright laws'|last=|first=|date=2009-04-15|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/en/content/cms/News___Press/UK_has_worst_copyrig/UK_has_worst_copyrig.aspx|title=UK has worst copyright laws \u2013 'by far'|last=|first=|date=28 July 2009|work=|accessdate=29 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523081313/http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/en/content/cms/News___Press/UK_has_worst_copyrig/UK_has_worst_copyrig.aspx|archive-date=May 23, 2009|publisher=[[Consumer Focus]]}}</ref> \n\nIn 2010, the UK government sought input on modernizing copyright exceptions for the digital age, and commissioned the ''[[Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth]]''. The review asserted that a private copying exception was overdue, citing that users were unaware of what was even legally allowed, and that a copyright law where \"millions of citizens are in daily breach of copyright, simply for shifting a piece of music or video from one device to another\" was not \"fit for the digital age\".<ref name=Hargreaves/> The review recommended, among other things, that the government consider adopting the EU [[Copyright Directive]]'s recommendation that member states enact an exception for private, noncommercial copying so long as the rights holders receive \"fair compensation.\" Other EU member states chose to implement the exception paired with a tax on music purchases or widely varying levies on copying equipment and blank media.<ref name=Hargreaves/><ref name=\"Impact\">{{cite web|url=https://ipo.gov.uk/ia-exception-privatecopy.pdf|title=Impact Assessment: Copyright Exception for Private Copying|last=|first=|date=13 Dec 2012|website=|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328013158if_/http://www.ipo.gov.uk//ia-exception-privatecopy.pdf|archivedate=2014-03-28|access-date=}}</ref> However, the Review reasoned that no such collections are necessary when implementing a copyright exception for format-shifting:\n\n{{quote|The UK has a thriving market for personal media devices which rely on private copying. We see no economic argument for adding an extra charge to these devices in order to authorise reasonable private acts which are part of the normal use of devices. Indeed, without that copying, normal use of those devices would be largely restricted to playing music or films bought online. We are not aware of strong evidence of harm to rights holders done by this kind of private copying in the normal course of using digital equipment to play works. There is considerable evidence of overall public benefits from consumer use. [...] The Review favours a limited private copying exception which corresponds to what consumers are already doing. As rights holders are well aware of consumers\u2019 behaviour in this respect, our view is that the benefit of being able to do this is already factored into the price that rights holders are charging. A limited private copying exception which corresponds to the expectations of buyers and sellers of copyright content, and is therefore already priced into the purchase, will by definition not entail a loss for right holders.<ref name=Hargreaves/>}}\n\nIn August 2011, the government broadly accepted the recommendations of the Hargreaves Review.<ref name=\"Response\">{{cite web|url=https://ipo.gov.uk/ipresponse-full.pdf|title=The Government Response to the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth|last=|first=|date=3 Aug 2011|website=|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> At the end of 2012, the government published \"Modernising Copyright\", a document outlining specific changes the government intends to make, including the Hargreaves-recommended exception for private, noncommercial copying.<ref name=\"Modernising\">{{cite web|url=https://ipo.gov.uk/response-2011-copyright-final.pdf|title=Modernising Copyright: A modern, robust and flexible framework|last=|first=|date=Dec 2012|website=|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514004319if_/http://www.ipo.gov.uk:80/response-2011-copyright-final.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-14|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing each milestone in the reform process, press reports circulated that ripping non-DRM-protected CDs and DVDs was no longer illegal.

For example, [[space shifting]], by making a copy of a personally owned audio CD for transfer to an MP3 player for that person's personal use, is not explicitly allowed or forbidden.\n\nExisting copyright statutes ''may'' apply to specific acts of personal copying, as determined in cases in the civil or criminal court systems, building up a body of [[case law]].

However, 17 USC 1008, the relevant text of the legislation, didn't fully indemnify consumers for noncommercial, private copying. Such copying is broadly permitted using analog devices and media, but digital copying is only permitted with certain technology like DAT, MiniDisc, and \"audio\" CD-R\u2014not with computer hard drives, portable media players, and general-purpose CD-Rs.\n\nThe AHRA was partially tested in ''RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia, Inc.'',<ref>180 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1999).</ref> a late-1990s case which broached the subject of a consumer's right to copy and format-shift, but which ultimately only ascertained that one of the first portable MP3 players wasn't even a \"digital recording device\" covered by the law, so its maker wasn't required to pay royalties to the recording industry under other terms of the AHRA.\n\nStatements made by the court in that case, and by both the House and Senate in committee reports about the AHRA, do interpret the legislation as being intended to permit private, noncommercial copying with any digital technology. However, these interpretations may not be binding.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), a government office which requires business to engage in consumer-friendly trade practices, has acknowledged that consumers normally expect to be able to rip audio CDs. Specifically, in response to the [[Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal]], the FTC declared that the marketing and sale of audio CDs which surreptitiously installed [[digital rights management]] (DRM) software constituted deceptive and unfair trade practices, in part because the record company \"represented, expressly or by implication, that consumers will be able to use the CDs as they are commonly used on a computer: to listen to, transfer to playback devices, and copy the audio files contained on the CD for personal use.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0623019/0623019cmp070629.pdf|title=DOCKET NO.

They are mainly used to transfer video on DVDs to different formats, to edit or back up DVD content, and to convert DVD video for playback on media players and mobile devices. Some DVD rippers include additional features such as [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] support, DVD and Blu-ray Disc decryption, [[Digital rights management|copy protection]] removal and the ability to make discs unrestricted and [[Regional lockout|region-free]].  While most DVD rippers only convert video to highly compressed [[MP4]] video files, there are other rippers that can convert DVDs to higher quality compressed video.  These types of DVD rippers are used by the television and film industry to create broadcast quality video from DVD.  Video ripped by these professional DVD rippers is an exact duplicate of the original DVD video.\n\n=== Circumvention of DVD copy protection ===\n\nIn the case where media contents are protected using some ''effective'' [[copy protection]] scheme, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) of 1998 makes it illegal to manufacture or distribute circumvention tools and use those tools for infringing purposes. In the 2009 case ''[[RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc.|RealNetworks v. DVD CCA]]'',<ref>{{citation\n|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/universal-city-studios-v-realnetworks\n|title=RealNetworks v.

One such ruling in 2010 declared, among other things, that the [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) commonly employed on commercial DVDs could be circumvented to enable non-infringing uses of the DVD's content.<ref>{{citation\n|url=http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html\n|title=Statement of the Librarian of Congress Relating to Section 1201 Rulemaking\n|publisher=U.S. Copyright Office\n|date=2010-07-23}}</ref> The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) hailed the ruling as enabling DVD excerpts to be used for the well-established fair-use activities of criticism and commentary, and for the creation of derivative works by video remix artists.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2010/07/26 |title=Rulemaking Fixes Critical DMCA Wrongs |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|date=2010-07-26}}</ref> However, the text of the ruling says the exemption can only be exercised by professional educators and their students, not the general public.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[CD ripper]]\n* [[Digital video recorder]]\n* [[Radio music ripping]]\n* [[Digital Rights Management]]\n* [[Telecine (copying)]], a copy of a film created with a telecine.\n* [[Screener (promotional)|DVDScr (DVD Screener)]]\n* [[R5 (bootleg)]]\n* [[Riplock]]\n* [[DVD Decrypter]]\n* [[Comparison of DVD ripper software]]\n* [[.bup|BUP]]\n* [[IFO]]\n* [[DVD authoring]]\n* [[VOB]]\n* [[Pirated movie release types]]\n* [[HandBrake]]\n* [[Blu-ray ripper]]\n* [[List of DVD authoring applications]]\n* [[DVD-Video]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Forms of pirated film releases}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Copyright law]]\n[[Category:Audio storage]]\n[[Category:Ripping]]\n[[Category:Video storage]]\n[[Category:Video conversion software]]\n[[Category:DVD]]\n", "name_user": "103.255.113.39", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripping"}

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers.

In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]], which is another collection than the ''Sa\u1e43yutta''.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

As pictured in a poem by [[Ausonius]], the victim could be affixed to the trunk of a tree with his arms attached to the branches. Even on its own the trunk could serve for that purpose. According to Lipsius, who quotes the report of [[Tertullian]] of the crucifixion of priests of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] on trees of their temple,<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/latin/apologeticum_becker.htm Tertullian, ''Apologeticus'', IX, 2]</ref> trees, either trimmed or in full foliage, were in fact used for this purpose, particularly in mass crucifixions.\n\nThe museum at [[Ein Kerem]], [[Israel]] known as the World of the Bible Garden has among its exhibits an olive tree arranged as for a crucifixion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatcommission.com/israel/2003030.jpg |title=Great Commission Illustrated, Ein Kerem - Bible Lands Museum Crucifixion tree cross |access-date=2017-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023541/http://www.greatcommission.com/israel/2003030.jpg |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1594, Lipsius gave as his opinion that from the ''crux simplex ad affixionem'' the cross as generally pictured today was developed.<ref name=Lipsius8/> In 1866, Patrick Farbairn expressed the same view in ''The Imperial Bible-Dictionary'', adding that the Romans commonly joined a transom to the upright when crucifying rather than impaling: \"Even amongst the Romans the ''crux'' (from which our ''cross'' is derived) appears to have been originally an upright pole, and this always remained the more prominent part. But from the time that it began to be used as an instrument of punishment, a transverse piece of wood was commonly added: not, however, always even then. For it would seem that there were more kinds of death than one by the cross; this being sometimes accomplished by transfixing the criminal with a pole, which was run through his back and spine, and came out at his mouth (adactum per medium hominem, qui per os emergat, stipitem)\".<ref>{{cite book|page=376\u2013377|title=The Imperial Bible-Dictionary |volume=I |year=1874|author= P.

But from the time that it began to be used as an instrument of punishment, a transverse piece of wood was commonly added: not, however, always even then. For it would seem that there were more kinds of death than one by the cross; this being sometimes accomplished by transfixing the criminal with a pole, which was run through his back and spine, and came out at his mouth (adactum per medium hominem, qui per os emergat, stipitem)\".<ref>{{cite book|page=376\u2013377|title=The Imperial Bible-Dictionary |volume=I |year=1874|author= P.
