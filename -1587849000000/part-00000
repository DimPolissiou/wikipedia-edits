During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern \"Rebel\" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the \"Rebels\" moniker remains to this day.

SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%.

No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials.\n\nUNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year, the men's football team plays the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] in a football game called the Battle for Nevada. The trophy for that game is the [[Fremont Cannon]].

During this time, Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern \"Rebel\" athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. Soon, protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the \"Rebels\" moniker remains to this day.

SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB was made to reflect 92% of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building, so reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High-performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, as well as a drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape, reduce water usage by 42%.

The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exceptions are the UNLV men's soccer team and swim and dive team, which compete in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].\n\nThe school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to 1958, when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned-down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting. No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials.\n\nUNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year, the men's football team plays the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football|Nevada Wolf Pack]] in a football game called the Battle for Nevada. The trophy for that game is the [[Fremont Cannon]]. Built by the [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott Copper]] Corp., Nevada Mines Division, the cannon is valued at more than $10,000 and is considered one of the best and loudest, symbols of rivalry in college football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |title=UNLV Official Athletic Site - Traditions |publisher=Unlvrebels.cstv.com |accessdate=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923160200/http://www.unlvrebels.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html |archive-date=2013-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> UNLV trails Nevada in the series 17\u201327 after winning the 2018 game at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Whitney, Nevada|Whitney]] by 34 to 29.\n\nUNLV is most known for its men's basketball program.

It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref> The area remained home to chicken and [[mink]] farms well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"PI-Bailey1998\">{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Gil |date=April 18, 1998 |title=Mountlake Terrace: This bedroom community has some living room |page=D1 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The initial stage of development had over 200 homes priced at a minimum of $4,999 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|4999|1949|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Alice |date=September 18, 1949 |title=$4,999 Two-Bedroom Home Draws Interest |page=25 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth. Some people waited a year for a party-line telephone, streets were unpaved, and household sanitation was provided by individual septic systems. The nearest police department was in Everett, 15 miles away. One resident, Patrick McMahan, became frustrated by these conditions, and organized a campaign to incorporate the community after [[Edmonds, Washington|Edmonds]] declined to study an annexation.<ref>{{cite book |page=301 |ref=harv |last1=Cameron |first1=David A. |last2=LeWarne |first2=Charles P. |last3=May |first3=M.

Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed. With the filing, on November 29, Mountlake Terrace officially became a third-class city.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />\n\n===Early growth===\nMountlake Terrace's population doubled between 1950 and 1960 and then nearly doubled again by 1970. Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959. In 1961 a bond issue was approved in a special election; it was used to build a City Hall.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref>{{cite news |date=December 2014 |title=Mountlake Terrace Looking Back 60 Years & Beyond |url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/Archive/ViewFile/Item/2850 |work=City Happenings |publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Slowing of development===\nThe city had been first envisioned as an automobile-based [[Commuter town|bedroom community]], but subsequent leaders began to envision it as a \"stand-alone\" development with an economically vital downtown area. This effort was aided by the arrival of Fluke and the construction of the two strip malls and the City Hall.<ref name=History />  However, this development halted in the 1980s. [[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area. West Plaza was out of business for 20 months; East Plaza was permanently shut down, replaced with a gymnastics center.}} In 1981, Fluke moved its facility to Everett. The 1980 census showed that Mountlake Terrace's population had dropped by almost 5 percent in 10 years. The city budget was repeatedly trimmed, but Mountlake Terrace entered 1989 with a $1.3 million deficit.<ref name=HistoryLink /> A planned hotel and office development was put on hold after complications with planning around streams and demolition of 14 homes from the original development.<ref>{{cite news |last=Aweeka |first=Charles |date=May 29, 1985 |title=Mountlake Terrace block houess are bleak but cheap |page=H2 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n[[Image:Mountlake Terrace 236th&56th.JPG|thumb|right|Intersection of 236th St SW and 56th Ave W in downtown Mountlake Terrace.]]\nThe mid-2000s saw new construction on 56th Avenue, and in 2006 the city created a plan to revitalize the downtown area and encourage economic activity.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />{{efn|The council approved design standards requiring that new developments be built with wide sidewalks, lots of windows, awnings, and interesting architectural details.}} As of 2013 the town's largest employer was [[Premera Blue Cross]], which employs some 3,000 people.<ref name=CAFR>[http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf City of Mountlake Terrace CAFR 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120444/http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\nA city-center plan adopted in February 2007 allows mixed-use buildings of up to seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks.

It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref> The area remained home to chicken and [[mink]] farms well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"PI-Bailey1998\">{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Gil |date=April 18, 1998 |title=Mountlake Terrace: This bedroom community has some living room |page=D1 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]].

However, in 2012 when then-Sheriff Rod Hoops announced his retirement, the Board of Supervisors appointed Assistant Sheriff John McMahon to the position. The Board made the appointment after determining that a special election for sheriff would be cost prohibitive ($3.5 million). McMahon was re-elected in 2014. The SBSO was featured on many episodes of the hit television series COPS, with the first 4 episodes being taped in the early 1990s.\n\n==History==\n===Early sheriffs of San Bernardino County===\nWhen San Bernardino County was established in 1853, its first sheriff was a Mormon, Robert Clift, who served until 1857.  On January 12, 1856, a volunteer [[militia]] unit known as the [[San Bernardino Rangers]] was organized under the command of Captain [[Andrew Lytle (pioneer)|Andrew Lytle]] to aid the Sheriff in suppressing raids by Indians and the gangs of outlaws like the [[Flores Daniel Gang]] that plagued the County.<ref>[http://www.militarymuseum.org/SanBernardinoRangers.html The California State Military Museum, '''California State Militia and National Guard Unit Histories: San Bernardino Rangers''', written by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in conjunction with the Office of the Adjutant General and the California State Library, 1940]</ref><ref>[http://www.militarymuseum.org/SoCal.pdf  J.

Raser was elected in September 1857 but left in the Mormon exodus for [[Utah]] soon after and Joseph Bridger was appointed by the Supervisors to the office until elections were held again in September 1858.  The winner in that election was James W. Mitchell, however on February 8, 1859, the Supervisors ordered that: \n: \"... the District Attorney Commence Suit against James W. Mitchell, Sheriff and his sureties for the amount of delinquent Taxes.\"\nSubsequently, at a special meeting of the Supervisors on February 26, 1859, [[Valentine J. Herring]] was named to be sheriff of San Bernardino County until the next election in September 1859.  V. J. Herring was still Sheriff during the [[Ainsworth Gentry Affair]] a couple of weeks after he lost the election to [[Charles Wesley Piercy]].   Piercy held the office from October 1859, until he resigned in October 1860 to run for the State Assembly and William Tarleton was appointed to take his place.  In November 1860, Anson Van Leuvan who had come second to Piercey in the previous election was elected and served as the Sheriff from 1860 to 1862.  He had difficulties enforcing the law in [[Belleville, California|Belleville]] and the other boom towns of the [[Holcomb Valley]] gold rush and with the turbulence caused in the County by the secession crisis and the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].  Eli M. Smith elected in the fall of 1861, was known for his pursuit of a gang of horse thieves who had been operating in the county for several months stealing horses made precious by the wartime need for horseflesh.  On one occasion Sheriff Smith rode into an outlaw camp, recovering a herd of stolen horses and arresting three thieves. By the end of his term in office he had convicted 18 men of horse theft and sent them to prison.\n\nSheriff [[Benjamin Franklin Mathews|Benjamin F.

John Rogers, a gang member sent to town to obtain provisions in San Bernardino, was captured after drunken boasting in the saloons of \"Whiskey Point\" by Sheriff Mathews and persuaded to disclose the gangs hideout.  Sheriff Mathews and his posse guided by Rogers, found and surprised Henry camped along the [[San Jacinto River (California)|San Jacinto River]] in [[Railroad Canyon]], (then called San Jacinto Canyon), about twenty-five miles south of town.  At sunrise on September 14, 1865, the [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] approached cautiously but Henry awoke and fired three shots, striking one posse member in the foot.  Henry died in a hail of gunfire, sustaining 57 wounds.  His corpse was taken back to town, photographed and his body was displayed to the public in Old West fashion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=D9gRgb6K3yAC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Sheriff+Benjamin+F.+Mathews+%22San+Bernardino+County%22&source=bl&ots=8HXiyprXeF&sig=4BaVngNVleECmuZ2avzlLffLddo&hl=en&ei=kY_EStj7GoSwsgPRvfmtCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false  M.

SBSD provides law enforcement services to the unincorporated areas of the county and contract law enforcement services to 14 of the county's cities, including [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]] and [[Chino Hills, California|Chino Hills]], serving a total of 1,029,466 of the county's 2 million residents.

However, in 2012 when then-Sheriff Rod Hoops announced his retirement, the Board of Supervisors appointed Assistant Sheriff John McMahon to the position. The Board made the appointment after determining that a special election for sheriff would be cost prohibitive ($3.5 million). McMahon was re-elected in 2014. The SBSO was featured on many episodes of the hit television series COPS, with the first 4 episodes being taped in the early 1990s.\n\n==History==\n===Early sheriffs of San Bernardino County===\nWhen San Bernardino County was established in 1853, its first sheriff was a Mormon, Robert Clift, who served until 1857.  On January 12, 1856, a volunteer [[militia]] unit known as the [[San Bernardino Rangers]] was organized under the command of Captain [[Andrew Lytle (pioneer)|Andrew Lytle]] to aid the Sheriff in suppressing raids by Indians and the gangs of outlaws like the [[Flores Daniel Gang]] that plagued the County.<ref>[http://www.militarymuseum.org/SanBernardinoRangers.html The California State Military Museum, '''California State Militia and National Guard Unit Histories: San Bernardino Rangers''', written by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in conjunction with the Office of the Adjutant General and the California State Library, 1940]</ref><ref>[http://www.militarymuseum.org/SoCal.pdf  J. M. Scammel, Military Units in Southern California, 1853-1862, Reprinted from California Historical Society Quarterly, Vol. XXIX, Number 3, Part III San Bernardino Units]</ref>  Sheriff James S. Raser was elected in September 1857 but left in the Mormon exodus for [[Utah]] soon after and Joseph Bridger was appointed by the Supervisors to the office until elections were held again in September 1858.  The winner in that election was James W. Mitchell, however on February 8, 1859, the Supervisors ordered that: \n: \"... the District Attorney Commence Suit against James W. Mitchell, Sheriff and his sureties for the amount of delinquent Taxes.\"\nSubsequently, at a special meeting of the Supervisors on February 26, 1859, [[Valentine J. Herring]] was named to be sheriff of San Bernardino County until the next election in September 1859.  V. J. Herring was still Sheriff during the [[Ainsworth Gentry Affair]] a couple of weeks after he lost the election to [[Charles Wesley Piercy]].   Piercy held the office from October 1859, until he resigned in October 1860 to run for the State Assembly and William Tarleton was appointed to take his place.  In November 1860, Anson Van Leuvan who had come second to Piercey in the previous election was elected and served as the Sheriff from 1860 to 1862.  He had difficulties enforcing the law in [[Belleville, California|Belleville]] and the other boom towns of the [[Holcomb Valley]] gold rush and with the turbulence caused in the County by the secession crisis and the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].  Eli M. Smith elected in the fall of 1861, was known for his pursuit of a gang of horse thieves who had been operating in the county for several months stealing horses made precious by the wartime need for horseflesh.  On one occasion Sheriff Smith rode into an outlaw camp, recovering a herd of stolen horses and arresting three thieves.

Sheriff Mathews and his posse guided by Rogers, found and surprised Henry camped along the [[San Jacinto River (California)|San Jacinto River]] in [[Railroad Canyon]], (then called San Jacinto Canyon), about twenty-five miles south of town.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.
