He had three wives; [[Kausalya]], [[Kaikeyi]] and [[Sumitra|blablablaSumitra]] and out of the union born [[Rama]] (the principal character in the Ramayana), [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Shatrughna]].\nKing Dasharatha was incarnation of Dronavasu Brahmin, who received a boon from Lord Vishnu in his first life in Satyayuga.\n\n==Early life==\n\nDasharatha was the son of King Aja of Ayodhya and Princess Indumati of [[Vidarbha]]. His birth name was Nemi, but he acquired the name Dasharatha as his chariot could move in all ten directions, fly as well as come down on earth and he could fight with ease in all these directions.\n\nDasharatha became the King after his parents died. He was a great warrior who single-handedly conquered the whole earth with his prowess and defeated and slew many Asuras in war.\n\nDasharath had three queen consorts, namely, [[Kaushalya]], [[Sumitra]] and [[Kaikeyi]]. Kaushalya was from the Kingdom of [[Magadha]]. Sumitra was from [[Varanasi|Kashi]]. Kaikeyi was from [[Kekeya Kingdom]]. Having an immense desire to beget a son, Dasharath promised Kaikeyi that the son she bore would succeed him as King of Ayodhya after she pleaded with him in the Kop Bhavan.\n\n==Yaj\u00f1a to beget sons==\n[[File:Dasharatha give Payasa to his wives.jpg|thumb|250px|Dasharatha gives Payasa to his wives]]\n\nDasharath performed a [[yaj\u00f1a]] with the help of Sage [[Rishyasringa]] on the advice of [[Vasishtha]].\n\nThe [[Yaj\u00f1a]] was the Putra-kameshti at the bank of Manorama river. Dasharath and Kaushalya had a daughter [[Shanta]], who was Rishyashringa's wife. As the conclusion of the [[Yagna]] drew near, [[Agni]] sprang out from the Yagnakunda (sacrificial fire pit) and handed Dasharatha a pot of [[kheer]] ([[payasa]]), advising him to distribute it among his queens.\n\nKaushalya ate half the kheer, Sumitra ate a quarter of it. Kaikeyi ate some and passed the pot back to Sumitra who consumed the kheer for the second time.\n\nThus the princes were conceived after the consumption of the kheer. Since Kaushalya had consumed the largest portion she gave birth to [[Rama]]. Kaikeyi gave birth to [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]]. Sumitra, who had consumed the kheer twice, gave birth to [[Lakshmana]] and [[Shatrughna]].\n\n==Killing of Shravan Kumara==\n{{unsourced section|date=November 2019}}\nAfter Rama's departure to the forest, Dasharatha lies in his bed with a wailing Kaushalya. He suddenly remembers an incident which had occurred in the past. He narrates to Kaushalya about how, by accident, he had killed a young boy named [[Shravan|Shravana]] mistaking him to be an elephant. Dasharatha who was then a crown prince had gone hunting on the banks of River Saryu. He was an expert in hunting by determining the direction of sound and heard the gurgle of an animal drinking water. Mistaking it to be water flowing through the trunk of an elephant, Dasharatha shot an arrow. He became mortified when he heard a human cry as the arrow found its target. Dasharatha hurried there to find a boy lying sprawled on the banks of the river with an arrow lodged in his chest. The boy forgives Dasharatha for his unintentional unrighteous act and demands that he pull the arrow out of his chest. He also tells him to take the pitcher of water to his blind parents who must be waiting for him. The boy dies. Dasharatha approaches the blind couple and tells them about their son's unfortunate death. The parents, grief-stricken curse the prince: \"Just as we are dying due to the separation from our beloved son, you too shall have the same fate.\" Dasharatha concludes the chapter by saying that his end is near and the curse has taken effect. The place where Dasharatha killed [[Shravan|Shravana]] is now known as [[Shravan Kshetra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/and-more/lord-rama-s-father-king-dasharatha-was-cursed-by-an-old-couple-here-s-why_1948399.html|title=Lord Rama\u2019s father King Dasharatha was cursed by an old couple- Here\u2019s why|last=|first=|date=2016-11-10|website=Zee News|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Demise==\n\nFollowing his narration of Shravana, Dasharatha dies in the night due to the pain and misery of his separation from Rama.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia and is known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours the Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One tooth possibly belonging to the genus was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Most of the aforementioned teeth were originally attributed to [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]]. A partial spinosaurid skeleton from the Khok Kruat Formation was described in 2007, but whether it belongs to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of its teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' has been placed within the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

The tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, thee flutes of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened them most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', with respect to their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed ''Siamosaurus'' in the Spinosauridae [[Family (biology)|family]], based on close similarities in dentition to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nMany palaeontologists have expressed skepticism towards Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of ''Siamosaurus'', given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have been time and again mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=2010-01-01|title=Spinosaurs before Stromer: early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/343/1/175|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=343|issue=1|pages=175\u2013188|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..175B|doi=10.1144/SP343.10|issn=0305-8719}}</ref> In view of this, the German palaeontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and colleagues in 2002 argued that there is not enough material to confidently identify ''Siamosaurus'' as a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sues|first=Hans-Dieter|last2=Frey|first2=Eberhard|last3=Martill|first3=David M.|last4=Scott|first4=Diane M.|date=2002-09-19|title=Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=535\u2013547|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0535:icasdt]2.0.co;2|issn=0272-4634}}</ref> In 2004, American palaeontologist [[Thomas Holtz]] and colleagues considered it a [[nomen dubium|''nomen dubium'']] (dubious name), stating that its teeth might instead belong to contemporaneous fish such as [[saurodontid]] or [[Ichthyodectidae|ichthyodectid]] [[Teleost|teleosts]].<ref name=\"HMC04\">Holtz Jr., T.R., Molnar, R.E., and Currie, P.J.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occured in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that, compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia and is known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours the Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One tooth possibly belonging to the genus was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Most of the aforementioned teeth were originally attributed to [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]]. A partial spinosaurid skeleton from the Khok Kruat Formation was described in 2007, but whether it belongs to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of its teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' has been placed within the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of ''\"Sinopliosaurus\" fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, thee flutes of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened them most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', with respect to their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occured in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that, compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.
