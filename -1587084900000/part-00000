Ocean City is a major beach resort area along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of the United States. The population was 7,102 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], although during summer weekends the city hosts between 320,000 and 345,000 vacationers, and up to 8 million visitors annually.<ref name=\"ocean-city1\"/> During the summer, Ocean City becomes the second most populated municipality in Maryland, after [[Baltimore]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is part of the [[Salisbury, MD-DE Metropolitan Statistical Area]], as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ocean City MD historical marker.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|An Ocean City historical marker in August 2013. It tells a brief history of the town.]]\nThe land upon which the city was built, as well as much of the surrounding area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy views of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to sit back and watch the rolling surf.{{fact|date=October 2018}}{{tone-inline|date=October 2018}}\n\nSoon after, other simple boarding houses were built on the strip of sand, with the activity attracting prominent businessmen from the [[Maryland Eastern Shore]], [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. They came not so much to visit as to survey the [[spit (landform)|spit]]. A decision was made to develop it and 250 lots were cut into it, and a corporation was formed to help with the development of the land. The corporation stock of 4,000 shares sold for $25 each.\n\nPrior to 1870, what is now Ocean City was known as \"The Ladies' Resort to the Ocean.\"\n\nThe Atlantic Hotel, the first major hotel in the town, opened July 4, 1875. The Atlantic Hotel was originally owned by the Atlantic Hotel Company, but eventually Charles W. Purnell bought it in 1923. It is still currently owned and operated by the Purnell family.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantichotelocmd.com/about|title = About|date = 2014|accessdate = 21 November 2014|website =Atlantic Hotel |publisher =Atlantic Hotel |last = |first = }}</ref> Besides the beach and ocean, it offered dancing and billiard rooms to the visitors of its more than 400 rooms, and for years it was the northern-most attraction in Ocean City. By 1878 tourists could come by the [[Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway#Wicomico .26 Pocomoke Railroad Company .281848-1890.29|Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad]] from [[Berlin, Maryland|Berlin]] to the shores of Sinepuxent Bay across from the town. By 1881, a line was completed across [[Sinepuxent Bay]] to the shore, bringing rail passengers on the [[Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad]] directly into the town to a train station on Philadelphia Avenue and returning to larger city markets with locally caught fish from Ocean City.\n\n[[Image:Oceancitymd inlet.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Ocean City's inlet during the offseason]]The Ocean City Inlet was formed during a [[1933 Chesapeake Potomac hurricane|significant hurricane]] in 1933, which also destroyed the train tracks across the Sinepuxent Bay. The inlet separated what is now Ocean City from [[Assateague Island]]. The Army Corps of Engineers took advantage of nature's intervention and made the inlet at the south end of Ocean City permanent. The inlet eventually helped to establish Ocean City as an important Mid-Atlantic fishing port as it offered easy access to the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged a new channel on the bayside of Ocean City to allow larger boats to have access to Sinepuxent Bay. The dredge was pumped back onto the western shore of Ocean City allowing the creation of Chicago Avenue and St. Louis Avenue, leading to new development where previously only marshland had been.<ref>[http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130822/NEWS/308220064/How-1933-hurricane-carved-lifeline-Ocean-City-Md- ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202192133/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130822/NEWS/308220064/How-1933-hurricane-carved-lifeline-Ocean-City-Md- |date=February 2, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOcean City has become a well-known city in Maryland due to the rapid expansion of Ocean City that took place during the post-war boom. In 1952, with the completion of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], Ocean City became easily accessible to people in the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]]. In 1964, with the completion of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], a whole new pathway to the south was opened. Ocean City became one of the largest vacation areas of the East Coast.\n\nBy the 1970s, big business flourished and gave birth to the construction of more than 15,000 condominium units, creating high-rise condominiums that gave investors a glimpse of the ocean and pounding surf.{{fact|date=October 2018}} However, throughout the 1980s, and into the 1990s, the width of the beach began to shrink, prompting the first of a series of [[beach nourishment|beach replenishment]] projects.\n\nThe original pier was destroyed by a fire in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.preservationmaryland.org/historic-ocean-city/|title=Historic Sites of Ocean City, Maryland|first=Preservation|last=Maryland|website=Preservation Maryland}}</ref> There was a small water park and giant walk-through haunted house with live actors near the end of the pier and a New Orleans-style Hollywood in Wax Museum on the boardwalk side. In the late 1980s the Wax Museum was turned into a Photon [[laser tag]] arena. The building now houses the [[Ripley's Believe it or Not!]] museum.\n\nIn 2002, Ocean City undertook the most recent of many, multimillion-dollar, [[beach restoration]] programs, in an attempt to slow the westward migration of its beaches. The program pumped tons of sand from offshore and deposited it onto the beach. A dune line was also re-established in front of Ocean City's building line.  Another similar project began after the 2006 tourist season closed.\n\nThe [[Sandy Point Site]] and [[St. Paul's by-the-sea Protestant Episcopal Church]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:Ocean City MD Boardwalk August 2009 1.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Ocean City boardwalk looking south.]]\n[[File:Ocean City MD Boardwalk August 2009 3.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Ocean City boardwalk at twilight looking north.]]\nToday, the Ocean City area continues to sprawl westward across the bay and toward [[Berlin, Maryland|Berlin]] and [[Ocean Pines, Maryland|Ocean Pines]]. It was part of the Ocean Pines [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]] until that was subsumed by the Salisbury Metropolitan Area. The resort area accommodates approximately 8 million visitors per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ococean.com/media |title=Ocean City Maryland - Media |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ocean City Maryland Convention and Visitors Bureau and Department of Tourism |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe town supports a year-round population of about 8,000, with the town itself being a major employer. Summer employment in Ocean City rises many multiples above that level, supported by a large number of college-age and young adults\u2014many native to Eastern Europe and Ireland\u2014attracted by numerous job opportunities. In the summer, businesses and government agencies are augmented with about 100 seasonal police officers, plus extra firefighters and other workers.\n\nTourism in the off-season has picked up pace over the past decade. Today, Ocean City, Maryland has become one of the most popular vacation areas of the East Coast. Warmer months like June, July, and August attract the most tourists due to the opening of the beaches as well as the many different activities available to do. A \"shoulder-season\" has been established that ranges in the spring from St. Patrick's Day until Memorial Day Weekend and in the fall from Labor Day Weekend until late October.  Many establishments stay open into November and December depending on local events and weather.  Numerous special events take place within the town during this shoulder-season, including Sunfest, Springfest, Bike Week, Cruisin' Weekend, Winterfest of Lights and Reach the Beach, which take place on the Boardwalk and/or in the [[Roland E. Powell Convention Center]]. Increased traffic from golfers and these special events have convinced many seasonal restaurants and hotels to open sooner and close down later in the year.\n\nIn 2006, the city erected the Ocean City Firefighter's Memorial to honor local firefighters as well as firefighters who died in the [[September 11 attacks]]. In addition to a statue of a firefighter, the monument incorporates a piece of steel beam from one of the towers destroyed at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ocean City Firefighter's Memorial|publisher=Ocean City Volunteer Fire Company|url=http://www.ocvfc.com/memorial.cfm|accessdate=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114072811/http://ocvfc.com/memorial.cfm|archive-date=November 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ocean City is home to the annual Maryland State Firefighters Convention. This is a week-long event in June, that honors the state's firefighters with events and contests at the Convention Center, and ends with a parade.\n\nNorth Ocean City houses many high-rise beachfront condominiums and hotels such as Century I, The Sea Watch, The Pyramid, The Plaza, Golden Sands Club, and The Carousel. This area is easily recognizable because of its city-like skyline. Restaurants and retail stores stretch north from the Inlet area all the way to Fenwick Island, DE.\n\n{{Panorama\n| image   = File:Ocean City, Maryland panorama.jpg\n| height  = 135\n| caption = A panoramic view of the beach in Ocean City from a condominium during the late afternoon, as seen in July 2013.\n| alt     = A beach with people scattered about and backlit by late afternoon sun.\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Executive Motel Ocean City MD2.jpg|thumb|left|Motel in Ocean City]]\nOcean City now extends just more than {{convert|9|mi|abbr=on}} from the southern inlet to the Delaware line. The strip now supports hotels, motels, apartment houses, shopping centers, residential communities, and condominiums. The southern tip houses the Ocean City Boardwalk. The boardwalk is the main shopping district and entertainment area of the town. The boardwalk has many prominent businesses including Fisher's Caramel Popcorn and Thrashers French Fries. Other notable boardwalk businesses are Dolle's Salt Water Taffy, Candy Kitchen, the Atlantic Stand, and Dumser's Dairyland.  The Boardwalk has two [[amusement park]]s, [[Trimpers Rides]] and The Pier, which was recently renamed [[Jolly Roger Amusement Park|Jolly Roger at The Pier]], after [[Jolly Roger Amusement Park|its sister uptown local amusement park]]. The downtown neighborhood, Old Town, is marked by Victorian style houses and other older buildings, many of which have been razed in recent years to construct more parking lots, hotels, and condos.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OCVFC 9-11 Memorial Ocean City, MD Boardwalk.jpg|thumbnail|left|OCVFC 9/11 Memorial on the Boardwalk at North Division St.]] -->\nOcean City has a long history of fishing, both commercial and recreational. The town bills itself as the \"White Marlin Capital of the World.\" During the summer numerous charter and private boats fish for [[billfish]], [[tuna]], [[wahoo]], and other game fish. In early August, one of the largest fishing tournaments in the world, the White Marlin Open, is held. Prize money for the largest [[White Marlin]], [[Atlantic blue marlin|Blue Marlin]], and [[Tuna]] can range over 1 million dollars.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ocean City MD pier from south.jpeg|thumb|right|Ocean City pier and beach]]\nOcean City is located at {{coord|38.391526|-75.069712|type:city_region:US-MD|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|36.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|4.41|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|31.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-07-02}}</ref>\n\nOcean City is on the barrier [[Spit (landform)|spit]] called [[Fenwick Island (Delaware\u2013Maryland)|Fenwick Island]], which encompasses Ocean City, as well as [[South Bethany, Delaware|South Bethany]] and [[Fenwick Island, Delaware]].

Rainfall and tides swelled the rivers and bays surrounding Ocean City until the overflowing water cut a 50-foot crevasse from the bay to the ocean.  Ocean City businessmen had long sought funding to create an inlet to support a harbor, so residents seized upon the opportunity and built jetties to ensure the city's land remained divided from what is now [[Assateague Island]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/eastern-shore/bal-hurricane2003,0,7880742.story|title=Reborn in a Hurricane|work=www.baltimoresun.com|publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{clear}}\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 49\n|1890= 85\n|1900= 365\n|1910= 476\n|1920= 711\n|1930= 946\n|1940= 1052\n|1950= 1234\n|1960= 983\n|1970= 1493\n|1980= 4946\n|1990= 5146\n|2000= 7173\n|2010= 7102\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=6927\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018|accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 7,102 people, 3,852 households, and 1,784 families residing in the town.

Old Pro Golf, the most well known chain of mini-golf in Ocean City, is located at several different addresses in Ocean City. The indoor and outdoor Old Pro Golf is located at 6801 Coastal Highway, which is in close proximity to the Golden Sands condominium complex. Herbert J. and Aileen Schoellkopf founded the Old Pro Golf business in 1965. Herbert became obsessed with the game of golf and began building and designing hundreds of golf courses. He first built the outdoor dinosaur golf course at 6801 Coastal Highway, and then eventually added the indoor golf course to attract more people.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://oldprogolf.com|title = About Us|date = 2014|accessdate = 22 November 2014|website = Ocean City MD Mini Golf & Amusements|publisher = Old Pro Golf|last = |first = }}</ref>\nThe city is home to the [[Brine]] Beach Lax Festival on the second week of June.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Radio===\nThe Town of Ocean City has an emergency advisory radio system broadcast on two [[FM broadcasting|FM]] frequencies. WPSB-LP is broadcast at 99.5 FM from the Public Safety Radio Tower at 65th Street while WWOP-LP is broadcast at 100.3 FM from a tower near [[Ocean Pines, Maryland|Ocean Pines]]. The system is meant to inform the public of emergency conditions such as severe weather and broadcasts 24-hour community information during non-emergency situations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advisory Radio Stations|publisher=Town of Ocean City, Maryland|url=http://oceancitymd.gov/oc/departments/emergency-services/electronic-services/advisory-radio-stations/|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref> The studios are located at the Ocean City Public Safety Building on 65th Street. Signs throughout Ocean City advise motorists of the station, with flashing lights advising them to tune in for emergency information. The emergency advisory radio system was launched on August 25, 2014 through a $55,000 grant through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program from the [[Maryland Emergency Management Agency]] and sponsored by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Program Your Radio Station to 99.5 FM \u2013 Ocean City\u2019s New Emergency Advisory Radio Station|publisher=Town of Ocean City, Maryland|date=August 25, 2014|url=http://oceancitymd.gov/oc/program-your-radio-station-to-99-5-fm-ocean-citys-new-emergency-advisory-radio-station/|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{Salisbury-Ocean City Radio}}\n\n===Television===\n{{Salisbury TV}} Ocean City is said to be the main inspiration for Beach city (the main town of Steven Universe).\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system, Ocean City, Maryland has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and moderately humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (''Cfak''). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature > 32.0 \u00b0F (> 0.0 \u00b0C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature \u2265 50.0 \u00b0F (\u2265 10.0 \u00b0C), at least one month with an average mean temperature \u2265 71.6 \u00b0F (\u2265 22.0 \u00b0C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Temperatures are moderated in Ocean City due to its location on the Atlantic coast. During the summer months, a cooling afternoon [[sea breeze]] is present on most days with an average of only 10 days annually reaching {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}}. However, in 2010 the temperature rose to {{convert|103|\u00b0F|0}} which was the hottest air temperature on record, and episodes of extreme heat combined with tropical humidity can occur with [[heat index]] values \u2265 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2265 38&nbsp;\u00b0C). The prominence of the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] to the south means direct hits from [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricane]]s are rare, although they sometimes brush the area. The [[Atlantic hurricane season]] extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, the air temperature fails to rise above freezing 5.8 days on average and the [[plant hardiness zone]] is 7b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 9.1&nbsp;\u00b0F (-12.7&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=August 7, 2019|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}</ref> Episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with [[wind chill]] values < 5&nbsp;\u00b0F (< -15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The coldest temperature on record was {{convert|-6|\u00b0F|0}}. The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is 6 to 12 inches (30 cm), and the average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in [[nor'easter]] activity.\n\n{{Weather box\t\n| width = auto\t\n| single line = Y\t\n| location = Ocean City Beach, MD (1981-2010 Averages)\n| Jan record high F = 77\n| Feb record high F = 78\n| Mar record high F = 88\n| Apr record high F = 94\n| May record high F = 98\n| Jun record high F = 102\n| Jul record high F = 103\n| Aug record high F = 100\n| Sep record high F = 99\n| Oct record high F = 94\n| Nov record high F = 84\n| Dec record high F = 78\n| year record high F = 103\n| Jan high F  =   \t44.3\n| Feb high F  =   \t46.3\n| Mar high F  =   \t53.3\n| Apr high F  =   \t62.1\n| May high F  =   \t71.0\n| Jun high F  =   \t79.9\n| Jul high F  =   \t84.4\n| Aug high F  =   \t83.2\n| Sep high F  =   \t77.6\n| Oct high F  =   \t68.0\n| Nov high F  =   \t58.4\n| Dec high F  =   \t48.6\n| year high F =   \t64.8\n| Jan mean F  =   \t36.7\n| Feb mean F  =   \t38.5\n| Mar mean F  =   \t45.0\n| Apr mean F  =   \t53.8\n| May mean F  =   \t62.7\n| Jun mean F  =   \t72.0\n| Jul mean F  =   \t77.0\n| Aug mean F  =  \t75.7\n| Sep mean F  =   \t69.9\n| Oct mean F  =   \t59.5\n| Nov mean F  =   \t50.2\n| Dec mean F  =   \t41.1\n| year mean F =   \t56.9\n| Jan low F  =   \t29.1\n| Feb low F  =   \t30.8\n| Mar low F  =   \t36.7\n| Apr low F  =   \t45.4\n| May low F  =   \t54.4\n| Jun low F  =   \t64.2\n| Jul low F  =   \t69.5\n| Aug low F  =   \t68.3\n| Sep low F  =   \t62.1\n| Oct low F  =   \t50.9\n| Nov low F  =   \t42.1\n| Dec low F  =   \t33.6\n| year low F =   \t49.0\n| Jan record low F = \u22126\n| Feb record low F = \u22122\n| Mar record low F = 8\n| Apr record low F = 22\n| May record low F = 30\n| Jun record low F = 40\n| Jul record low F = 45\n| Aug record low F = 41\n| Sep record low F = 31\n| Oct record low F = 22\n| Nov record low F = 15\n| Dec record low F = \u22122\n| year record low F = \u22126\n| precipitation colour = green\t\n| Jan precipitation inch  =   \t3.19\n| Feb precipitation inch  =   \t2.67\n| Mar precipitation inch  =   \t3.61\n| Apr precipitation inch  =   \t3.02\n| May precipitation inch  =   \t3.10\n| Jun precipitation inch  =   \t3.18\n| Jul precipitation inch  =   \t3.32\n| Aug precipitation inch  =   \t3.87\n| Sep precipitation inch  =   \t3.02\n| Oct precipitation inch  =   \t3.17\n| Nov precipitation inch  =   \t2.96\n| Dec precipitation inch  =   \t3.21\n| year precipitation inch =   \t38.32\n| humidity colour = green\t\n| Jan humidity    =\t68.8\n| Feb humidity    =\t68.4\n| Mar humidity    =\t63.9\n| Apr humidity    =\t66.0\n| May humidity    =\t71.4\n| Jun humidity    =\t74.4\n| Jul humidity    =\t74.8\n| Aug humidity    =\t76.3\n| Sep humidity    =\t74.7\n| Oct humidity    =\t72.9\n| Nov humidity    =\t71.1\n| Dec humidity    =\t69.5\n| year humidity   =\t71.0\n| Jan dew point F =\t27.4\n| Feb dew point F =\t29.0\n| Mar dew point F =\t33.5\n| Apr dew point F =\t42.7\n| May dew point F =\t53.3\n| Jun dew point F =\t63.4\n| Jul dew point F =\t68.4\n| Aug dew point F =\t67.7\n| Sep dew point F =\t61.5\n| Oct dew point F =\t50.8\n| Nov dew point F =\t41.2\n| Dec dew point F =\t31.9\n| year dew point F =\t47.7\n| source 1 = NOAA<ref>{{cite web\n|url = https://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/\n|title = 1981-2010 Normals for Ocean City, Maryland\n|accessdate = January 14, 2018}}</ref>\n| date   = January 2018\n|source 2 = PRISM<ref name=prism>{{cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref>}}\t\n\t\n\t\n{{Weather box\t\n| width = auto\t\n| single line = Y\t\n| location = Ocean City, MD Ocean Water Temperature\t\n| Jan mean F  =   \t37\n| Feb mean F  =   \t34\n| Mar mean F  =   \t42\n| Apr mean F  =   \t50\n| May mean F  =   \t56\n| Jun mean F  =   \t63\n| Jul mean F  =   \t69\n| Aug mean F  =  \t71\n| Sep mean F  =   \t70\n| Oct mean F  =   \t62\n| Nov mean F  =   \t53\n| Dec mean F  =   \t44\n| year mean F =   \t54\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web|url=https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|title=Water Temperature Table of All Coastal Regions|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ecology==\n\nAccording to the [[A.

Ocean City is a major beach resort area along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of the United States. The population was 7,102 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], although during summer weekends the city hosts between 320,000 and 345,000 vacationers, and up to 8 million visitors annually.<ref name=\"ocean-city1\"/> During the summer, Ocean City becomes the second most populated municipality in Maryland, after [[Baltimore]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is part of the [[Salisbury, MD-DE Metropolitan Statistical Area]], as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ocean City MD historical marker.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|An Ocean City historical marker in August 2013. It tells a brief history of the town.]]\nThe land upon which the city was built, as well as much of the surrounding area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy views of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to sit back and watch the rolling surf.{{fact|date=October 2018}}{{tone-inline|date=October 2018}}\n\nSoon after, other simple boarding houses were built on the strip of sand, with the activity attracting prominent businessmen from the [[Maryland Eastern Shore]], [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. They came not so much to visit as to survey the [[spit (landform)|spit]]. A decision was made to develop it and 250 lots were cut into it, and a corporation was formed to help with the development of the land. The corporation stock of 4,000 shares sold for $25 each.\n\nPrior to 1870, what is now Ocean City was known as \"The Ladies' Resort to the Ocean.\"\n\nThe Atlantic Hotel, the first major hotel in the town, opened July 4, 1875. The Atlantic Hotel was originally owned by the Atlantic Hotel Company, but eventually Charles W. Purnell bought it in 1923. It is still currently owned and operated by the Purnell family.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantichotelocmd.com/about|title = About|date = 2014|accessdate = 21 November 2014|website =Atlantic Hotel |publisher =Atlantic Hotel |last = |first = }}</ref> Besides the beach and ocean, it offered dancing and billiard rooms to the visitors of its more than 400 rooms, and for years it was the northern-most attraction in Ocean City. By 1878 tourists could come by the [[Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railway#Wicomico .26 Pocomoke Railroad Company .281848-1890.29|Wicomico & Pocomoke Railroad]] from [[Berlin, Maryland|Berlin]] to the shores of Sinepuxent Bay across from the town. By 1881, a line was completed across [[Sinepuxent Bay]] to the shore, bringing rail passengers on the [[Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad]] directly into the town to a train station on Philadelphia Avenue and returning to larger city markets with locally caught fish from Ocean City.\n\n[[Image:Oceancitymd inlet.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Ocean City's inlet during the offseason]]The Ocean City Inlet was formed during a [[1933 Chesapeake Potomac hurricane|significant hurricane]] in 1933, which also destroyed the train tracks across the Sinepuxent Bay. The inlet separated what is now Ocean City from [[Assateague Island]]. The Army Corps of Engineers took advantage of nature's intervention and made the inlet at the south end of Ocean City permanent. The inlet eventually helped to establish Ocean City as an important Mid-Atlantic fishing port as it offered easy access to the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged a new channel on the bayside of Ocean City to allow larger boats to have access to Sinepuxent Bay. The dredge was pumped back onto the western shore of Ocean City allowing the creation of Chicago Avenue and St. Louis Avenue, leading to new development where previously only marshland had been.<ref>[http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130822/NEWS/308220064/How-1933-hurricane-carved-lifeline-Ocean-City-Md- ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202192133/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130822/NEWS/308220064/How-1933-hurricane-carved-lifeline-Ocean-City-Md- |date=February 2, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOcean City has become a well-known city in Maryland due to the rapid expansion of Ocean City that took place during the post-war boom. In 1952, with the completion of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], Ocean City became easily accessible to people in the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]]. In 1964, with the completion of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], a whole new pathway to the south was opened. Ocean City became one of the largest vacation areas of the East Coast.\n\nBy the 1970s, big business flourished and gave birth to the construction of more than 15,000 condominium units, creating high-rise condominiums that gave investors a glimpse of the ocean and pounding surf.{{fact|date=October 2018}} However, throughout the 1980s, and into the 1990s, the width of the beach began to shrink, prompting the first of a series of [[beach nourishment|beach replenishment]] projects.\n\nThe original pier was destroyed by a fire in 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.preservationmaryland.org/historic-ocean-city/|title=Historic Sites of Ocean City, Maryland|first=Preservation|last=Maryland|website=Preservation Maryland}}</ref> There was a small water park and giant walk-through haunted house with live actors near the end of the pier and a New Orleans-style Hollywood in Wax Museum on the boardwalk side. In the late 1980s the Wax Museum was turned into a Photon [[laser tag]] arena. The building now houses the [[Ripley's Believe it or Not!]] museum.\n\nIn 2002, Ocean City undertook the most recent of many, multimillion-dollar, [[beach restoration]] programs, in an attempt to slow the westward migration of its beaches. The program pumped tons of sand from offshore and deposited it onto the beach. A dune line was also re-established in front of Ocean City's building line.  Another similar project began after the 2006 tourist season closed.\n\nThe [[Sandy Point Site]] and [[St. Paul's by-the-sea Protestant Episcopal Church]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:Ocean City MD Boardwalk August 2009 1.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Ocean City boardwalk looking south.]]\n[[File:Ocean City MD Boardwalk August 2009 3.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Ocean City boardwalk at twilight looking north.]]\nToday, the Ocean City area continues to sprawl westward across the bay and toward [[Berlin, Maryland|Berlin]] and [[Ocean Pines, Maryland|Ocean Pines]]. It was part of the Ocean Pines [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]] until that was subsumed by the Salisbury Metropolitan Area. The resort area accommodates approximately 8 million visitors per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ococean.com/media |title=Ocean City Maryland - Media |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ocean City Maryland Convention and Visitors Bureau and Department of Tourism |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe town supports a year-round population of about 8,000, with the town itself being a major employer. Summer employment in Ocean City rises many multiples above that level, supported by a large number of college-age and young adults\u2014many native to Eastern Europe and Ireland\u2014attracted by numerous job opportunities. In the summer, businesses and government agencies are augmented with about 100 seasonal police officers, plus extra firefighters and other workers.\n\nTourism in the off-season has picked up pace over the past decade. Today, Ocean City, Maryland has become one of the most popular vacation areas of the East Coast. Warmer months like June, July, and August attract the most tourists due to the opening of the beaches as well as the many different activities available to do. A \"shoulder-season\" has been established that ranges in the spring from St. Patrick's Day until Memorial Day Weekend and in the fall from Labor Day Weekend until late October.  Many establishments stay open into November and December depending on local events and weather.  Numerous special events take place within the town during this shoulder-season, including Sunfest, Springfest, Bike Week, Cruisin' Weekend, Winterfest of Lights and Reach the Beach, which take place on the Boardwalk and/or in the [[Roland E. Powell Convention Center]]. Increased traffic from golfers and these special events have convinced many seasonal restaurants and hotels to open sooner and close down later in the year.\n\nIn 2006, the city erected the Ocean City Firefighter's Memorial to honor local firefighters as well as firefighters who died in the [[September 11 attacks]]. In addition to a statue of a firefighter, the monument incorporates a piece of steel beam from one of the towers destroyed at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ocean City Firefighter's Memorial|publisher=Ocean City Volunteer Fire Company|url=http://www.ocvfc.com/memorial.cfm|accessdate=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114072811/http://ocvfc.com/memorial.cfm|archive-date=November 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ocean City is home to the annual Maryland State Firefighters Convention. This is a week-long event in June, that honors the state's firefighters with events and contests at the Convention Center, and ends with a parade.\n\nNorth Ocean City houses many high-rise beachfront condominiums and hotels such as Century I, The Sea Watch, The Pyramid, The Plaza, Golden Sands Club, and The Carousel.

The boardwalk is the main shopping district and entertainment area of the town. The boardwalk has many prominent businesses including Fisher's Caramel Popcorn and Thrashers French Fries. Other notable boardwalk businesses are Dolle's Salt Water Taffy, Candy Kitchen, the Atlantic Stand, and Dumser's Dairyland.  The Boardwalk has two [[amusement park]]s, [[Trimpers Rides]] and The Pier, which was recently renamed [[Jolly Roger Amusement Park|Jolly Roger at The Pier]], after [[Jolly Roger Amusement Park|its sister uptown local amusement park]]. The downtown neighborhood, Old Town, is marked by Victorian style houses and other older buildings, many of which have been razed in recent years to construct more parking lots, hotels, and condos.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OCVFC 9-11 Memorial Ocean City, MD Boardwalk.jpg|thumbnail|left|OCVFC 9/11 Memorial on the Boardwalk at North Division St.]] -->\nOcean City has a long history of fishing, both commercial and recreational. The town bills itself as the \"White Marlin Capital of the World.\" During the summer numerous charter and private boats fish for [[billfish]], [[tuna]], [[wahoo]], and other game fish.

They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F. Curta, the homeland of the southern Slavs mentioned by 6th-century writers was just north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=56}} Little is known about the Slavs before the 5th century, when they began to spread out in all directions.\n\n[[Jordanes]], [[Procopius]] and other [[Late Antiquity|late Roman]] authors provide the probable earliest references to southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=71\u201373}} Procopius described the [[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]] as two barbarian peoples with the same institutions and customs since ancient times, not ruled by a single leader but living under democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}</ref> while Pseudo-Maurice called them a numerous people, undisciplined, unorganized and leaderless, who did not allow enslavement and conquest, and resistant to hardship, bearing all weathers.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|pp=524\u2013525}} They were portrayed by Procopius as unusually tall and strong, of dark skin and \"reddish\" hair (neither [[blond]] nor [[black hair|black]]), leading a primitive life and living in scattered huts, often changing their residence.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} Procopius said they were [[henotheistic]], believing in the god of lightning ([[Perun]]), the ruler of all, to whom they sacrificed cattle.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} They went into battle on foot, charging straight at their enemy, armed with spears and small shields, but they did not wear armour.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}\n\nWhile archaeological evidence for a large-scale migration is lacking, most present-day historians claim that Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26\u201341}} According to this dominant narrative, up until the late 560s their main activity across the Danube was raiding, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine colonies of ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded upon by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} From the Danube, the Slavs commenced raiding the Byzantine Empire on an annual basis from the 520s, spreading destruction, taking loot and herds of cattle, seizing prisoners and taking fortresses. Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work. They created the [[Glagolitic script]] and the first Slavic written language, [[Old Church Slavonic]], which they used to translate Biblical works. At the time, the West and South Slavs still spoke a similar language. The script used, [[Glagolitic]], was capable of representing all Slavic sounds, however, it was gradually replaced in Bulgaria in the 9th century, in Russia by the 11th century{{sfn|Portal|1969|pp=90\u201392}} Glagolitic survived into the 16th century in Croatia, used by Benedictines and Franciscans, but lost importance during the [[Counter-Reformation]] when Latin replaced it on the Dalmatian coast.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=92}} Cyril and Methodius' disciples found refuge in already [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christian Bulgaria]], where the [[Old Church Slavonic]] became the ecclesiastical language.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=92}} [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]] was developed during the 9th century AD at the [[Preslav Literary School]] in [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Francis | last=Dvornik |title=The Slavs: Their Early History and Civilization | quote = The Psalter and the Book of Prophets were adapted or \"modernized\" with special regard to their use in Bulgarian churches, and it was in this school that glagolitic writing was replaced by the so-called Cyrillic writing, which was more akin to the Greek uncial, simplified matters considerably and is still used by the Orthodox Slavs. | year=1956 |place=Boston | publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |page=179}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt |url-access=registration |quote=Cyrillic preslav. |title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500\u20131250|series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks|author= Florin Curta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0521815390|pages= [https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt/page/221 221]\u2013222}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-H9BTVHKRMC&pg=PR3-IA34&lpg=PR3-IA34&dq=The+Orthodox+Church+in+the+Byzantine+Empire+Cyrillic+preslav+eastern#v=onepage&q=%20preslav%20eastern&f=false|chapter= The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire|title=Oxford History of the Christian Church|author= J.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

There are an estimated 35 million South Slavs and their descendants living worldwide. Among South Slavic ethnic groups that are also nations are the [[Serbs]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Slovenes]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats are the constituent nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among South Slavic minorities or self-identifications are the [[Yugoslavs]] (former Yugoslavia), [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] (former Yugoslavia), [[Macedonian Muslims|Torbeshi]] (North Macedonia), [[Pomaks]] (Bulgaria, Greece) and [[Gorani people|Gorani]] (Kosovo). The Catholic [[Bunjevci]] and [[\u0160okci]], concentrated in [[Vojvodina|northern Serbia]] and eastern Croatia, are divided between Croat and local identities.

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in
