The airport's code, GEG, is derived from its airfield's namesake, Major [[Harold Geiger]].\n\nAs of 2015, Spokane International Airport (GEG) ranks as the 70th-busiest airport in the United States in terms of passenger enplanements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calendar Year 2015 Passenger Boardings at Commercial Service Airports|url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger/media/cy15-commercial-service-enplanements.pdf|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref> At 4,112,784 total passengers served in 2019, it is also the second busiest airport in Washington. GEG is served by six airlines with [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] service to 15 airports in 13 markets.\n\nIt is included in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) [[National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems]] for 2017\u20132021, in which it is [[FAA airport categories|categorized]] as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.<ref name=\"NPIAS Airports\">{{cite web|title=List of NPIAS Airports|url=https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/npias/reports/media/NPIAS-Report-2017-2021-Appendix-A.pdf|website=FAA.gov|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Army Air Forces - Postcard - Geiger Field Washington.jpg|thumb|left|World War II Geiger Field Postcard]]\n[[File:Geiger Field Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Geiger Field in 1943]]\nKnown as '''Sunset Field''' before 1941, it was purchased from the county by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and renamed '''Geiger Field''' after Major [[Harold Geiger]], an [[United States Army Air Corps|Army aviation]] pioneer who died in a crash in 1927.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Geiger Field was a major training base by [[Second Air Force]] as a group training airfield for [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombardment units, with new aircraft being obtained from [[Boeing]] near [[Seattle]]. It was also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; Deer Park Airport and [[Felts Field]] were auxiliaries.\n\nIn 1943, General Hap Arnold established the first formal fire protection training course at Geiger Field, Washington. It was used until 1946.\n\nGeiger Field was served by a rail connection to the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]].<ref>Staff, \"Align Rail Route To Air Depot\", ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, Wednesday 13 May 1942, Volume 59. Number 364, page 6.</ref>\n\nGeiger was closed in late 1945 and turned over to [[War Assets Administration]] (WAA), then transferred to Spokane County and developed into a commercial airport. The airport hosted USAF [[Air Defense Command]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] units during the [[Cold War]] for air defense of [[Hanford Site|Hanford Nuclear Reservation]] and [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. Built in 1942 as the Spokane Air Depot, [[Fairchild Air Force Base]] is four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the west.\n\nIt became Spokane's municipal airport in 1946, replacing [[Felts Field]], and received its present name in 1960, after the City of Spokane was allotted Spokane Geiger Field by the Surplus Property Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spokaneairports.net/faq.htm|title=Spokane Intl Airport \u2013 Home}}</ref> It was still used by the Air Force into the early 1960s, with the [[84th Combat Sustainment Group#Air Defense Command|84th Fighter Group]] operating [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106 Delta Dart]] [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptors]].<ref name=gfintcp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cDlWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z-gDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7212%2C1786223 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |title=Geiger's fast interceptors protecting area and nation |date=January 6, 1963 |page=6}}</ref> The airport code is still GEG, for Geiger Field.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SpokaneIntAirport32.JPG|thumb|left|Concourse A and B complex originally opened in 1965]]\nThe current Concourse A and B complex opened in 1965 and was designed by Warren C.

While several expansions to the concourse extended the building's original architectural style, other additions have altered it. In 1974, a second floor was added to both Concourses A and B to allow for the implementation of [[Jet bridge|passenger boarding bridge]] access to aircraft. The new floors, while sharing some material commonality with the original Heylman and Trogdon concourse, lacked the same curvy and sculpted neo-expressionistic forms. The later additions of the ground transportation facility and Concourse C to the ends of the concourse building further altered the architecture by replacing its distinct bookend elevations and entrances with corridors to the adjacent buildings. Interior renovations in the mid-2000s also replaced many of Concourse A-B complex's original sculpted forms and monolithic materials with more rectilinear forms and contemporary finish materials. Despite this, many of the original architectural elements remain integral to the space (such as the exposed concrete roof trusses and concrete columns), creating a juxtaposition between the newer elements and the original architecture.\n\nUnder the proposed Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program to accommodate projected growth, the separate baggage claim areas in Concourse A-B and Concourse C would be consolidated into a single baggage claim with five carousels, and A-B would receive a renovation. Ultimately, operations at A-B would wind down under long-term plans to construct a new terminal in 2030, at the earliest.<ref name=S-R-170719>{{cite news |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/jul/19/spokane-airport-eyeing-major-improvements/#/0\n |title=Spokane Airport eyeing major improvements |author=Prager, Mike |date=19 July 2017 |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Southwest Airlines]] is the current primary occupant operating in and out of Concourse A.

However, it draws inspiration from its neo-expressionist neighbor by architecturally expressing a modular, repetitive, and exposed structural grid through its fa\u00e7ade and interior lobby areas.\n\n[[Alaska Airlines]] and its sister carrier [[Horizon Air]] were the primary occupants operating in and out of Concourse C after [[Frontier Airlines]] ceased operations to Spokane in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frontier Airlines ending service at Spokane International Airport|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/dec/22/frontier-airlines-ending-service-at-spokane/|work=Spokesman Review|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref> However, that changed once [[American Airlines]] relocated to Concourse C in March 2016.

It was also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; Deer Park Airport and [[Felts Field]] were auxiliaries.\n\nIn 1943, General Hap Arnold established the first formal fire protection training course at Geiger Field, Washington. It was used until 1946.\n\nGeiger Field was served by a rail connection to the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]].<ref>Staff, \"Align Rail Route To Air Depot\", ''The Spokesman-Review'', Spokane, Washington, Wednesday 13 May 1942, Volume 59.

While several expansions to the concourse extended the building's original architectural style, other additions have altered it. In 1974, a second floor was added to both Concourses A and B to allow for the implementation of [[Jet bridge|passenger boarding bridge]] access to aircraft. The new floors, while sharing some material commonality with the original Heylman and Trogdon concourse, lacked the same curvy and sculpted neo-expressionistic forms. The later additions of the ground transportation facility and Concourse C to the ends of the concourse building further altered the architecture by replacing its distinct bookend elevations and entrances with corridors to the adjacent buildings. Interior renovations in the mid-2000s also replaced many of Concourse A-B complex's original sculpted forms and monolithic materials with more rectilinear forms and contemporary finish materials. Despite this, many of the original architectural elements remain integral to the space (such as the exposed concrete roof trusses and concrete columns), creating a juxtaposition between the newer elements and the original architecture.\n\nUnder the proposed Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program to accommodate projected growth, the separate baggage claim areas in Concourse A-B and Concourse C would be consolidated into a single baggage claim with five carousels, and A-B would receive a renovation. Ultimately, operations at A-B would wind down under long-term plans to construct a new terminal in 2030, at the earliest.<ref name=S-R-170719>{{cite news |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/jul/19/spokane-airport-eyeing-major-improvements/#/0\n |title=Spokane Airport eyeing major improvements |author=Prager, Mike |date=19 July 2017 |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Southwest Airlines]] is the current primary occupant operating in and out of Concourse A.

Flanagan has been the sole trademark owner of the group's name since the early 1990s,\u00a0the primary songwriter and only member featured on every album, while Joseph and Mackie continued to tour with other musicians using the Cro-Mags name against the wishes of Flanagan. In April 2019, Flanagan reached a settlement with Joseph and Mackie in which Flanagan would retain exclusive rights to the Cro-Mags name while Joseph and Mackie would move forward under the name, Cro-Mags \"JM\".\n\n==History==\nThe band's early years were spent living in burnt out buildings, squats and on the streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cro-mags.com/|title=The Official Cro-Mags Website|website=Cro-mags.com|accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> By 1982/83 Flanagan recorded the very first Cro-Mags [[demo (music)|demo]] consisting of 4 songs that would become the blue print for their debut album ''[[The Age of Quarrel]]'' ([[1986 in music|1986]]). Flanagan wrote all of the music, played each instrument, and performed vocals. Before long he connected with Parris Mayhew and the two started writing music and auditioning band members. Age of Quarrel singer John Joseph parted ways with the band for the first time after Age of Quarrel, leaving [[bass guitar|bass]] player Harley Flanagan to sing on the following Cro-Mags release, ''[[Best Wishes (Cro-Mags album)|Best Wishes]]'' ([[1989 in music|1989]]), which had a more heavy metal-influenced sound. The next record ''[[Alpha Omega (Cro-Mags album)|Alpha Omega]]'' saw the return of Joseph singing along with Flanagan. According to guitarist and songwriter Parris Mayhew, he wrote most of the album with guitarist Rob Buckley. However, neither Mayhew or Buckley played on the actual recording and the writing has been disputed by Flanagan and others. The Cro-Mags disbanded and later recorded the album with the return of [[Doug Holland]] and a new rhythm guitarist: [[Gabby Abularach]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cro-mags.com/emails.htm|title=The Official Cro-Mags Website|website=Cro-mags.com|accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n\nThe album ''[[Near Death Experience (Cro-Mags album)|Near Death Experience]]'' was released in 1993, after which the group disbanded for several years. They began touring again in the late 1990s with Flanagan on vocals and bass and Mayhew returning to the fold and eventually released ''[[Revenge (Cro-Mags album)|Revenge]]'' in 2000. For many fans, this album signified a return to Cro-Mags' early hardcore roots. Many songs were comparable to those on ''The Age of Quarrel'', although some featured a more melodic/punk rock style. The release of ''Revenge'' and its subsequent tour resulted in yet another break up, which caused lasting resentment between Mayhew and Flanagan. In 2001 Flanagan asked Joseph to join him once again, but that was a short lived reunion and ended in 2002.\n\nIn 2008, John Joseph and Mackie began playing shows under the Cro-Mags name with other established hardcore musicians such as Craig Setari from Sick of It All on bass, and A.J.

The band, which has a strong [[cult following]],{{fact|date=February 2020}} has released five studio albums, their first two considered the most influential.{{fact|date=February 2020}} With a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] background, they were among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with [[thrash metal]]{{fact|date=February 2020}} and were associated with the birth of a tougher attitude within the hardcore scene in the late 1980s,{{fact|date=February 2020}} related to the world of martial arts.{{fact|date=February 2020}} [[Harley Flanagan]] (formerly drummer for [[The Stimulators (NYC band)|the Stimulators]]) and [[John Joseph (singer)|John Joseph]] are practitioners of [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] and [[boxing]] respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bjjstyle.com/hardcore-legend-harley-flanagan-his-journey-to-black-belt/|title=HARDCORE LEGEND HARLEY FLANAGAN: HIS JOURNEY TO BLACK BELT \u2013 Jiu Jitsu Style|last=Style|first=Jiu Jitsu|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.triathlete.com/2013/03/features/john-joseph-from-frontman-to-ironman_71597|title=John Joseph: From Frontman To Ironman|last=Harder|first=Jeff|date=2013-03-05|website=Triathlete.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe Cro-Mags have gone through many line-up changes since the band's beginnings. Flanagan has been the sole trademark owner of the group's name since the early 1990s,\u00a0the primary songwriter and only member featured on every album, while Joseph and Mackie continued to tour with other musicians using the Cro-Mags name against the wishes of Flanagan. In April 2019, Flanagan reached a settlement with Joseph and Mackie in which Flanagan would retain exclusive rights to the Cro-Mags name while Joseph and Mackie would move forward under the name, Cro-Mags \"JM\".\n\n==History==\nThe band's early years were spent living in burnt out buildings, squats and on the streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cro-mags.com/|title=The Official Cro-Mags Website|website=Cro-mags.com|accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref> By 1982/83 Flanagan recorded the very first Cro-Mags [[demo (music)|demo]] consisting of 4 songs that would become the blue print for their debut album ''[[The Age of Quarrel]]'' ([[1986 in music|1986]]). Flanagan wrote all of the music, played each instrument, and performed vocals. Before long he connected with Parris Mayhew and the two started writing music and auditioning band members. Age of Quarrel singer John Joseph parted ways with the band for the first time after Age of Quarrel, leaving [[bass guitar|bass]] player Harley Flanagan to sing on the following Cro-Mags release, ''[[Best Wishes (Cro-Mags album)|Best Wishes]]'' ([[1989 in music|1989]]), which had a more heavy metal-influenced sound. The next record ''[[Alpha Omega (Cro-Mags album)|Alpha Omega]]'' saw the return of Joseph singing along with Flanagan. According to guitarist and songwriter Parris Mayhew, he wrote most of the album with guitarist Rob Buckley. However, neither Mayhew or Buckley played on the actual recording and the writing has been disputed by Flanagan and others. The Cro-Mags disbanded and later recorded the album with the return of [[Doug Holland]] and a new rhythm guitarist: [[Gabby Abularach]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cro-mags.com/emails.htm|title=The Official Cro-Mags Website|website=Cro-mags.com|accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n\nThe album ''[[Near Death Experience (Cro-Mags album)|Near Death Experience]]'' was released in 1993, after which the group disbanded for several years. They began touring again in the late 1990s with Flanagan on vocals and bass and Mayhew returning to the fold and eventually released ''[[Revenge (Cro-Mags album)|Revenge]]'' in 2000. For many fans, this album signified a return to Cro-Mags' early hardcore roots. Many songs were comparable to those on ''The Age of Quarrel'', although some featured a more melodic/punk rock style. The release of ''Revenge'' and its subsequent tour resulted in yet another break up, which caused lasting resentment between Mayhew and Flanagan. In 2001 Flanagan asked Joseph to join him once again, but that was a short lived reunion and ended in 2002.\n\nIn 2008, John Joseph and Mackie began playing shows under the Cro-Mags name with other established hardcore musicians such as Craig Setari from Sick of It All on bass, and A.J. Novello from Leeway on guitar. In an October 2010 interview, Joseph revealed that they were planning to release a new album in 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/40101/cro-mags-plan-2011-album|title=Cro-Mags plan 2011 album|website=Punknews.org}}</ref> though ultimately this did not happen.

The new BCA gives an exchange ratio of 11.00 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, up from the original agreement of 9.75 Sprint shares. SoftBank, Sprint\u2019s owner, has agreed to surrender 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the New T-Mobile, making SoftBank\u2019s effective ratio of 11.31 shares per T-Mo share. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to get the original fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mo share. Following the closing of the merger, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom will hold approximately 43% of New T-Mobile\u2019s shares while SoftBank will hold 24% and the remaining 33% will be held by public shareholders. The previous deal saw DT getting 42%, SoftBank getting 27%, and public shareholders getting 31%.  The new agreement has an outside/long stop date of July 1, 2020, which is when either and/or both parties can walk away from the deal if it has not closed yet.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/02/t-mobile-sprint-updated-merger-agreement/|title=T-Mobile, Sprint confirm updated merger agreement|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.t-mobile.com/news/t-mobile-sprint-business-combination-agreement|title=T-Mobile and Sprint Announce Amendment to Business Combination Agreement|last=Bellevue|last2=Washington|website=www.t-mobile.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21|last3=Overl|last4=Park|last5=February 20|first5=Kansas-|last6=2020 \u2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2020, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced he will not appeal the judge\u2019s decision last month to reject the state AGs\u2019 lawsuit against the T-Mobile-Sprint merger.

The terms of the settlement include making its low-cost T-Mobile Connect plans available in California for at least 5 years, that T-Mobile customers can keep their T-Mobile plans held in February 2019 for a total of five years, to enact Project 10 Million, part of the New T-Mobile Un-carrier 1.0 move, that will offer a free hotspot device and 100GB of free broadband internet per year for five years to 10 million low-income households, for all current T-Mobile and Sprint employees in California must receive an offer of \u201csubstantially similar employment\u201d with New T-Mobile, to make the number of New T-Mobile employees in California will be equal to or greater than the current number of T-Mobile and Sprint employees, to open a new customer support center in Kingsburg, CA that will create approximately 1,000 new jobs, to increase participation in employee Diversity and Inclusion program to 60% within 3 years, and to reimburse California and other states that participated in merger lawsuit for the costs of the investigation and litigation, up to a total of $15 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/03/california-ag-xavier-becerra-not-appeal-judge-t-mobile-sprint-merger-ruling/|title=California AG Xavier Becerra will not appeal judge\u2019s T-Mobile-Sprint merger ruling|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> This is significant because he was the last of the two leaders in the lawsuit, the other being New York Attorney General Letita James.\n\nAlso on March 11, 2020, the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] announced a proposal to approve the merger.

For now, both business' will remain separate to consumers. All retail stores, networks, rate plans, and websites will remain separate, with the merger mostly changing behind the scenes things for now. The companies have stated that, over time, the two brands will integrate into one to consumers, and they will release further information as that happens. Leadership, ownership, and stock trading for the two companies has changed immediately, however.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==Wireless networks==\nThe company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900&nbsp;MHz (PCS) and 1700&nbsp;MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700&nbsp;MHz band (block A mostly) available in certain parts of the country. In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit-switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet-switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speed improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum.

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

[[Edward Markey]] revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7\u201310 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after the account is closed).<ref>[http://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/11539/news/wireless-carriers-reveal-user-data-requests Mobile Phone Reviews: Wireless Carriers Reveal User Data Requests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nComparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 to 6 years. T-Mobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid) to 7\u201310 years.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies|Telecommunication|United States}}\n* [[List of companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n* [[List of United States wireless communications service providers]]\n* [[List of mobile network operators of the Americas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* [http://www.telekom.com/  Deutsche Telekom AG's homepage ]\n* [https://www.metropcs.com/ MetroPCS's official website]\n\n{{Finance links\n| name = T-Mobile US\n| symbol = TMUS\n| sec_cik = TMUS\n| reuters = TMUS.O\n| bloomberg = TMUS:US\n| yahoo = TMUS\n| google = TMUS\n}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Deutsche Telekom}}\n{{United States mobile communications brands}}\n{{Caribbean mobile phone companies}}\n{{Puerto Rico mobile phone companies}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Seattle Corporations}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n|state=expanded\n}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mobile phone companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Wi-Fi providers]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bellevue, Washington]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Deutsche Telekom]]\n[[Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n[[Category:2013 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{short description|American telecommunications company}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = T-Mobile US, Inc.\n| logo                = T-Mobile US Logo 2020 RGB Magenta on Transparent.svg\n| image               = File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg\n| image_size          = 300px\n| image_caption       = T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, Washington\n| type                = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as           = {{ubl|{{NASDAQ|TMUS}}|[[NASDAQ-100]] component|[[S&P 500]] component}}\n| ISIN                = US8725901040\n| industry            = [[Telecommunications]]\n| predecessor         = VoiceStream Wireless Inc. <br /> T-Mobile USA Inc. <br /> MetroPCS Communications Inc. <br /> [[Sprint Corporation]]\n| foundation          = {{Start date and age|1994}} (as VoiceStream Wireless PCS)\n| founder             = [[John W.

The new BCA gives an exchange ratio of 11.00 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, up from the original agreement of 9.75 Sprint shares. SoftBank, Sprint\u2019s owner, has agreed to surrender 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the New T-Mobile, making SoftBank\u2019s effective ratio of 11.31 shares per T-Mo share. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to get the original fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mo share. Following the closing of the merger, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom will hold approximately 43% of New T-Mobile\u2019s shares while SoftBank will hold 24% and the remaining 33% will be held by public shareholders. The previous deal saw DT getting 42%, SoftBank getting 27%, and public shareholders getting 31%.

All retail stores, networks, rate plans, and websites will remain separate, with the merger mostly changing behind the scenes things for now. The companies have stated that, over time, the two brands will integrate into one to consumers, and they will release further information as that happens. Leadership, ownership, and stock trading for the two companies has changed immediately, however.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />\n\n==Wireless networks==\nThe company owns licenses to operate a cellular communications network in the 1900&nbsp;MHz (PCS) and 1700&nbsp;MHz (AWS) bands with coverage in many parts of the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as licenses in the 700&nbsp;MHz band (block A mostly) available in certain parts of the country. In 2017 T-Mobile also acquired a nationwide 600&nbsp;MHz license. It expects to deploy this spectrum over the next few years as it is vacated by television stations across the country in stages. With respect to technology, depending on the location, in the 1900&nbsp;MHz band it deploys [[GSM]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]], and/or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] ([[LTE frequency bands|Band]] 2); in the 1700&nbsp;MHz band it deploys UMTS/HSPA+ and/or LTE (B4 and B66); and LTE-only in the 700&nbsp;MHz (B12) and 600&nbsp;MHz (B71) bands. Its LTE network also supports [[VoLTE]]. It provides coverage in areas where it does not own [[radio frequency]] spectrum licenses via roaming agreements with other operators of compatible networks.\n\n===Cellular network===\nThe company's predecessor, VoiceStream Wireless, began building a regional, [[2G]], 1900&nbsp;MHz GSM, circuit-switched, digital cellular network in 1994 and first offered service in 1996 in [[Honolulu]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. From that starting point, the network has expanded in size through acquisitions of other cellular-network operators and additional spectrum purchases. The network has also expanded in capabilities through the introduction of new technologies. VoiceStream upgraded the 1900&nbsp;MHz network to include packet switching via [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), then increased packet-switched data transmission speeds via [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]. In 2006, the company spent $4.2 billion to purchase 120 D, E or F block 1700&nbsp;MHz AWS licenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cellularmaps.com/aws_auction.shtml |title=Cellular Maps.com-AWS Wireless Auction Results Maps |publisher=Cellularmaps.com |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> and began rolling out [[3G]] UMTS services in those frequency bands. The company upgraded network equipment and [[back-haul]] capabilities to enable [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] (High Speed Packet Access), and later [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services.\n[[File:T-Mobile Headquarters in Bellevue, WA.jpg|thumb|T-Mobile US headquarters in Bellevue, WA]]\n\n====Packet-switched data upgrade====\nPacket-switched data service first became available to users in the form of [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). Packet-switched data speeds increased when [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) was incorporated into the network. EDGE coverage was available within at least forty percent of the GSM footprint.<ref>T-Mobile USA's [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106054447/http://support.t-mobile.com/knowbase/root/public/tm22696.htm#top \"What is EDGE\"].  t-mobile.com.</ref>\n\nBoth voice capacity and packet-switched data speed improved when 3G [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) equipment was installed in the network. On January 5, 2010, the company announced that it had upgraded its entire 3G network to HSPA 7.2 Mbit/s, an improvement from its previous peak of 3.6 Mbit/s. It also said that it planned to be the first U.S. carrier to deploy [[Evolved HSPA|HSPA+]] across its network by mid-2010. The company had finished HSPA+ trials in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and had begun deploying HSPA+ across its network.\n\n===={{anchor|3G AWS upgrade}}3G upgrade / discontinuation====\nIn September 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) auctioned licenses in the first [[Advanced Wireless Services]] band. This band was an area of wireless [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], half in the 1700 [[MHz]] (1.7 [[GHz]]) and half in the 2100 [[MHz]] (2.1 [[GHz]]) frequencies, that was already in use by government services. The spectrum was planned to become available after the government users migrated to different frequencies.\n\nThe auction made numerous licenses available in overlapping market-areas, economic-areas, and regional levels. Each license was individually bid upon, and T-Mobile USA was the winner in 120 license auctions, at an aggregate price of $4.18 billion. As part of its winnings, T-Mobile USA gained nationwide coverage of 1.7&nbsp;GHz and 2.1&nbsp;GHz, with numerous areas being supplemented with additional licenses. Examples include New York City, Chicago, and Boston where T-Mobile USA acquired one-third (33 percent) of the available spectrum, or San Francisco, [[Houston]], and Miami where they acquired 45 percent of the available spectrum.<ref name=\"fcc_aws_results\">FCC's [http://wireless.fcc.gov/auctions/default.htm?job=auction_summary&id=66 \"Auction 66 Summary\"]. [[Federal Communications Commission]].</ref>\n\nOctober 6, 2006, two weeks after confirming its winning bids, the company announced its intentions to create a [[UMTS]] third-generation, or [[3G]], cellular network with the spectrum it had won. It said it would utilize and build on the experience of T-Mobile International's European subsidiaries, which already implemented 3G networks. At the time of initial roll-out, the company intended to offer 7.2 Mbit/s service, making the company's 3G network the fastest in the U.S. The upgrade was forecast to cost $2.6 billion, in addition to the $4.12 billion spent to acquire the spectrum licenses.<ref name=\"TMO_US_3G_announcement\">Rash, Wayne (October 6, 2006).

With the equipment in place, it would be able to activate its network as soon as the government agencies vacated the spectrum.

By doing so, all plans after a select amount of inclusive high-speed data, result in automatic throttled speeds, preventing unlimited high-speed tethering use and abuse of the network. T-Mobile stated that there are a small handful of users who abuse the tethering plan by altering device software and/or the use of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app that masks T-Mobile's ability monitoring whether data is on-smartphone, or through smartphone mobile hotspot (tethering) by mimicking all data as on-smartphone use, with some customers abusing the service by using as much as 2 [[Terabyte|TB]] per month, causing speed issues for all other customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/31/9230595/t-mobile-unlimited-data-tethering-warning|title=T-Mobile will now punish customers who abuse unlimited data|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===InReach program===\nThe InReach program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|title=InReach Program at T-Mobile US|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123043942/https://lifeline.t-mobile.com/|archivedate=January 23, 2014}}</ref> provides a free cell phone and a limited number of voice minutes each month for [[low-income]]-eligible families (one per family) who do not use Lifeline services offered by any other phone or wireless company.

This document was uncovered by the ACLU's coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police. Notably, the document showed that T-Mobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years (prepaid) and 5 years (postpaid).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/cell-phone-location-tracking-request-response-cell-phone-company-data-retention-chart|title=Cell Phone Location Tracking Request Response \u2013 Cell Phone Company Data Retention Chart|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Massachusetts Sen. [[Edward Markey]] revealed responses from the top four U.S. wireless providers as well as U.S. Cellular, C Spire, and Cricket/Leap Wireless, to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials. The following was T-Mobile's response regarding data retention: T-Mobile US retains customers' historic cell site information and cell tower dump information (180 days); call details records (7\u201310 years); text message content, data requests, and geo-location data not stored; voicemail content (up to 21 days); subscriber information (6 years after the account is closed).<ref>[http://uk.pcmag.com/smartphones/11539/news/wireless-carriers-reveal-user-data-requests Mobile Phone Reviews: Wireless Carriers Reveal User Data Requests<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nComparing the 2010 DOJ memo released by the ACLU and Markey's 2013 wireless data retention disclosures, T-Mobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 to 6 years.

This channel was later known as Solar USA (the acronym stands for \"Ultimate in Suspense and Action\"), and then later simply as USA before it was replaced by two separate channels.\n\nIn January 2004, Solar launched on cable sports alternative channel as Sports Plus.\n\nOn August 23, 2004, Solar Entertainment launched [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] or Entertainment Central, which is positioned as the country\u2019s premier cable female entertainment channel. ETC is a platform that brings its audience closer to their aspirational lifestyle, as embodied by their idols.\n\nOn May 5, 2005, it test launched delivering debuting service. Intended for a predominantly male audience, the company launched the country\u2019s leading general entertainment cable channel, [[Jack TV]], in July.\n\nOn October 15, 2005, Solar Entertainment launched a crime and action cable channel, Crime/Suspense or [[C/S]].\n\nOn December 15, 2005, Solar Entertainment launched a spin-off channel to ETC, [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|ETC 2nd Avenue]], a lifestyle and general entertainment channel. Started as a test broadcast on December 15, 2005, and had its full launch in 2006. The channel was later renamed as 2nd Avenue on January 17, 2007.\n\nOn October 1, 2006, Sports Plus ceased broadcasting and replaced by the [[Basketball TV]] channel formed by Solar, while moving most of Sports Plus programs to [[Solar Sports]].\n\n===As a broadcast company===\nOn January 1, 2008, Solar Entertainment Corporation began to lease block airtime with terrestrial TV networks, [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] and [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]]. The move was a result of [[SkyCable]] pulling out C/S, ETC, and 2nd Avenue from the cable company's lineup at their own right. Those three started carrying shows from Solar's, with [[C/S]] on RPN, [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|ETC]] on SBN, and [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]] on RJTV.\n\n[[File:Solar Sports.png|200px|thumb|left| Former logo of [[Solar Sports]]]]\nOn May 22, 2009, a victory party for [[Manny Pacquiao|Manny \"Pacman\" Pacquiao]], who just became the new IBO (International Boxing Organization) and ''Ring Magazine'' Light Welterweight Champion, was held at the Renaissance Hotel in [[Makati City]], in partnership with [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Solar and [[GMA Network|GMA]] executives at that time signed for a partnership in TV coverage of Manny Pacquiao's upcoming boxing matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/photos/1295/gma-victory-party-for-manny-pac-man-pacquiao|title=GMA victory party for Manny 'Pac-Man' Pacquiao|author=|date=|work=PEP.ph|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe C/S cable channel was later rebranded as [[C/S Origin]] in September 2008, while the RPN network later changed its branding to [[C/S 9]] the next month.\n\nOn November 29, 2009, Solar rebranded C/S9 as [[Solar TV]] at 11:00 am with a slogan ''It's A Bright New World'' on RPN. On October 31, 2010, it changed some of its programming content to English/Tagalog with a new slogan ''Kung Saan Lahat Panalo!''.\n\nIn mid-2010, GemCom sold all of its 97% equity share in [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] to Solar for Php 368.8 million. Since then, SBN became a fully owned subsidiary of Solar.\n\nOn February 11, 2011, SEC partnered with [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Corporation]] to air [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) games over free TV starting February 19, 2011.

Full broadcast started on September 30, 2011.\n\nIn May 2011, [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] launched the slogan \"Young and Loving It\".

In February 2012, both services aired a promotion, announcing the split of CHASE and TGC to form themselves as separate channels. On February 15, 2012, The Game Channel finally shuts down on free TV and was relaunched as a cable channel; CHASE was also relaunched as a separate channel, now occupying the entire BEAM broadcast airtime on Free TV.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Solar transferred its former Salcedo Village facilities to their new facility in Worldwide Corporate Center in [[Mandaluyong|Mandaluyong City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2012/04/solar-news-update-debuts-new-look.html|title=Solar News Update debuts new look|website=Medianewser.com}}</ref> It also featured a newly constructed set for Solar's then-news division, which would become fully functional three months later.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, Solar News launched its first local newscast ''Solar Network News'', followed by ''Solar Nightly News'', an hourly Solar News Update, Solar Daybreak, and Solar Newsday.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Jack TV plugged their announcement through CHASE programs bearing the title \"Another Jack TV is rising, coming soon on this channel\" (BEAM Channel 31). This indicated that CHASE was being replaced; finally, on October 20, 2012, Jack City was then launched, marking October 19 as the end of CHASE's broadcasts. [[Jack City]] still does carry some of CHASE's programs however.\n\nIn October 2012, it was found out that Solar News would replace the government-controlled RPN News, as a result of RPN's privatization, making Solar TV covering the entire network's airtime. More than 200 RPN employees, particularly those from the labor union and the NewsWatch staff, were retrenched and RPN News was closed down on October 29, effectively axing NewsWatch and NewsCap. Some retrenched government employees were relocated to either [[People's Television Network|People's Television Network (PTV 4)]] or [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC 13)]] (both State-run broadcasters).\n\n[[File:FvfOmbudsman0222 37.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A [[Toyota HiAce]] van used by Solar News parked at the Office of the Ombudsman.]]\nOn October 30, 2012, at 5:45 am, TalkTV was replaced as Solar News Channel on Channel 21 via [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]]. The channel saw the relaunch of sports news program ''Solar Sports Desk'' (now known as [[Sports Desk (2004 TV series)|CNN Philippines Sports Desk]]), as well as the initial telecast of the Solar News and Current affairs block in November 2012 comprising five public affairs programs ([[Legal Help Desk|Legal HD]], [[MedTalk]], [[News.PH]], [[Opposing Views]], Elections 2013 and [[News Cafe]]), ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Undercover Boss (U.S. TV series)|Undercover Boss]]'' and the \"Stories\" [[documentary film|documentaries]] block. In January 2013, Solar News Cebuano (now known as [[CNN Philippines Cebuano News]]) made history as the first national newscast delivered in a local dialect. In 2014, it also launched the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] national newscast, [[Kapampangan News]] and the public service program ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]'', which is shown in [[Filipino language]].\n\nPrior to the channel's transfer to RPN, SNC's flagship newscast (Solar Network News) simulcasted on RPN 9 (free TV only) from the SNC's launch. The news content for RPN (then affiliated with ETC), however, was switched to ''Solar Nightly News'' on January 14, 2013, onwards, to avoid backlash from free TV viewers, particularly Free TV viewers of ''[[American Idol]]'' (in which the original plan was to replace the 6 pm via satellite broadcast to Free TV viewers by Network News, then airs the AI episodes at the 8 pm rerun in simulcast with cable and satellite viewers). Throughout the ''American Idol'' season, as the episodes are repeated at 8 PM on cable, Solar used the separate free TV-only feed, that contains reruns of selected ETC shows (but with advertisements replaced by ETC teasers and promotions) at 8&nbsp;pm and ''Nightly News'' at 9 PM (with additional ETC programs, if necessary) to be used by RPN after each AI via satellite episode before RPN returns to the main ETC feed at 10 PM. This is to retain RPN's news content as it then has no newscast since the axing of NewsWatch.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, SEC launched Blink Cinema (later renamed as [[My Movie Channel]]) with the full broadcast taking effect later that month.\n\nOn April 14, 2013, [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] and Solar Entertainment Corporation joined to broadcast the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]] in Manila on Philippine television on August 1\u201311.

As a result of this ownership change, STVNI, Solar News Channel and RPN's majority stake were separated from the Tiengs; while ETC, 2nd Avenue, and Jack City reverted to Solar Entertainment's ownership.\n\nOn September 1, 2014, [[Jack City]] ended its run on free TV due to the preparations being made by [[Broadcast Enterprises and Affiliated Media|BEAM 31]] for the incoming transition to ISDB-T digital television, though it continues to be broadcast as a separate cable channel. However, Jack City continued to broadcast on cable networks until March 21, 2015. After Jack City's closure to free TV, BEAM aired under blocktime programs from various local production and religious companies. On November 15, 2014, BEAM began being carried on [[SkyCable]] and Destiny Cable subscribers (per compliance with NTC's \"must-carry\" basis). This move resulted of Jack City in a change of its channel assignment for SkyCable and [[Destiny Cable]] subscribers, as well as several pay TV companies.\n\nIn 2015, Solar Entertainment Corporation launched the #1stonPHTV brand of Solar channels for [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]], Jack City and [[My Movie Channel]], with the brand implemented on January 6, 2015. Since then, all SEC channels broadcast first-run foreign television programs with the hashtag #1stonPHTV (First on Philippine TV), which was formerly known as \"Match Airing\" (ETC), \"Playing 1st\" (Jack TV), \"The Newest in the US\" and \"FastCast\" (2nd Avenue) and \"See It First\" (Jack City).\n\n[[The Game Channel]], after almost three years on broadcasting, selling or ceased on February 28, 2015. The channel space was taken over by [[My Movie Channel]] on March 1.\n\nOn March 22, 2015, Jack City was replaced by [[CT (TV channel)|CT]], thus becoming independent from its parent network. Upon launch, the channel broadened its programming focus by adding talk shows, sitcoms and men's lifestyle programs to its roster.\n\nOn March 26, 2015, Solar Entertainment announced its broadcast of the \"Fight Of The Century\" between [[Manny Pacquiao]] and [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on May 3, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2015/03/27/1437964/abs-cbn-gma-tv5-join-hands-air-pacquiao-fight-networks-unite-historic|title=ABS-CBN, GMA, TV5 join hands to air Pacquiao fight: Networks unite for historic broadcast|first=Abac|last=Cordero|date=March 27, 2015|work=PhilStar.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref> As stated in a press conference that day, it was broadcast on May 3 via delayed broadcast in three major television stations in the Philippines, [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]], and [[GMA Network]] (who waived its exclusive contract with Solar to allow its multi-network coverage, but maintained its exclusive live broadcast on its radio division), with [[Solar Sports]] as its main content provider for this historic event in boxing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/boxing-mma/pacquiao/88062-pacquiao-mayweather-television-broadcast-ph|title=Pacquiao vs Mayweather to be televised by GMA, ABS-CBN and TV5|author=|date=|work=Rappler.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/459458/sports/boxing/pacquiao-mayweather-fight-to-air-live-over-gma-radio-stations-nationwide|title=Pacquiao-Mayweather fight to air live over GMA radio stations nationwide|author=|date=|work=GMANetwork.com|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2015, My Movie Channel ceased broadcasting. The closure or selling was announced by Solar a day before.\n\n===Rebranding of the four flagship networks===\nOn October 16, 2016, Solar relaunched its flagship channels ETC, 2nd Avenue, Basketball TV and Solar Sports. The four networks unveiled their new logos, on-air graphics and station IDs, which took effect on that day. CT, Jack TV, Shop TV and NBA Premium TV on the other hand remains unchanged. Also that day, Solar launched its corporate campaign slogan ''...There's More To Come'', which evolved in 2017 as ''We go for More''.\n\nIn 2017, Solar Entertainment became the official Philippine broadcaster of the 65th edition of the [[Miss Universe]] in Manila. This led to another deal with [[ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] (the second time that such deal happened between Solar and the Big 3 networks). According to some sources, a directive from [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Duterte]] ordered that the major networks must cover the prestige pageant as it happens live in the [[Philippines]]. Alongside the Big Three, Solar Entertainment channels [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|etc]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]] and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] aired the pageant simultaneously. It was also in the same year when Solar Entertainment forged a joint venture with the Bermuda-based communications satellite company [[Asia Broadcast Satellite]] to launch the first nationwide free-to-air [[Satellite television#Direct broadcast via satellite|direct-to-home]] satellite television services using the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]], which is set to launch on the 3rd quarter of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/broadcasting/2017/05/22/abs-solar-group-launch-new-dth-service-philippines/|title=ABS, The Solar Group to Launch New DTH Service in the Philippines|author=Kendall Russell|date=May 22, 2017|work=Satellite Today|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Carriage disputes==\n===Sky Cable===\n====2008====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSolar's channels have ceased airing on [[Sky Cable]], the Philippines' largest cable television provider. An insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that these troubles with Sky Cable started when boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], whose fights Solar Entertainment has the exclusive right to air and distribute to, moved from [[ABS-CBN]], the flagship television network of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and the primary owner of [[Sky Cable Corporation]], to rival [[GMA Network]]. Another insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that SkyCable wanted to remove [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and [[Jack TV]] to make room for their own channels, [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]] (now defunct) and [[Maxxx]] (now defunct). Sky Cable wanted to retain [[C/S]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Solar Sports]] and [[Basketball TV]], but Solar made a decision that they would only renew their contract if Sky Cable carried all six channels. Thus, Solar decided to pull out all their channels rather than remove ETC and Jack TV.\n\nHowever, Solar has signed a deal with local terrestrial channels [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC]], [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] and [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]] for block-time programming. C/S, ETC and 2nd Avenue programming are seen on terrestrial TV channels RPN, SBN and RJTV, respectively, while [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[WWE]] programming were seen on TV5, now moved to RPN (WWE programming are currently being broadcast thru TV5, while its terrestrial NBA coverage were moved to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] under Solar).\n\nMost of its channels were later returned to Sky Cable, while Jack TV would eventually return to its lineup on January 1, 2010 replacing Maxxx.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacquiao's boxing promotion, [[Top Rank]], signed a non-guaranteed contract with [[ABS-CBN Sports]] to exclusively air fights promoted by Top Rank, with the exception of Pacquiao fights which are still signed exclusively through Solar Entertainment.\n\n====2017\u201319====\nOn April 10, 2017, 3 days before the [[2017 NBA Playoffs]] was scheduled to begin (and coincided with the final day of the [[2016\u201317 NBA season|2016\u201317 NBA regular season]]), Basketball TV, [[NBA Premium TV]], Solar Sports, Jack TV and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] (now defunct) were removed by Solar from Sky Cable (including [[Sky Direct]], [[Destiny Cable]] & [[Sky On Demand]] thru video on demand) without any prior announcement from Solar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/167065-sky-nba-premium-btv-unavailable |title=Sky subscribers frustrated as NBA Premium, BTV unavailable for playoffs start |last= Rola|first=Alyssa |date= April 16, 2017|website=[[Rappler]] |access-date= April 16, 2017|quote=}}</ref> Initially, both Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV were replaced by airing a simulcast of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]] with a ticker announcing the unavailability of the channels, with Solar Sports, Jack TV and CT (now defunct) also doing the latter albeit with a black screen. Later, almost all of the pulled-out Solar channels were replaced by an imaging card, initially detailing the unavailability of the channels and then later, announcing that they will discuss with Solar on returning the aforementioned channels; while for BTV and NBA Premium TV, a schedule of the NBA games that will air on [[ABS-CBN]], ABS-CBN Sports and Action and [[Fox Sports Asia|Fox Sports]] within the week and a loop of an NBA promo. Solar did not comment on the situation for the removal of the channels, but sources and some netizens pointed out a carriage dispute between the two parties for not paying an undisclosed price to continue broadcasting these channels, which was later proven true by an article published by the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''.\n\nAs the dispute continued, some media enthusiasts and netizens raised concerns of whether these Solar channels will return to Sky and/or Destiny. Others pointed that inaction between the two parties could affect the next long-term local broadcast franchise with the NBA, slated to begin at the Association's 2019-2020 regular season. (Currently, Solar and Sky's parent, ABS-CBN, have a shared broadcast agreement to air the NBA games on pay and terrestrial television, respectively. Rumours circulated that both networks may bid separately, if they could not reach renewal, and use their respective infrastructure to broadcast adequate NBA coverage; otherwise, rival networks with a functioning sports department like [[5 (TV channel)|The 5 Network]] may also seek their own bidding to steal the 2019 contract from both Solar and ABS-CBN.)\n\nNetizens and viewers were dismayed and frustrated by the removal of the said channels by Sky Cable, most notably for BTV and NBA Premium due to the importance of the Playoffs. Some netizens were angered by the removal of the said channels and asked Sky Cable to return the channels before the scheduled Playoffs would begin, however Sky Cable would respond to angered netizens on social media that they are \"fixing the situation with Solar\". Other netizens and viewers would otherwise switch providers from Sky Cable to other cable companies that carried these channels or to other satellite providers like [[Cignal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/news/sky-cable-nba-premium-basketball-tv-negotiations-with-solar |title=SKYcable unable to give timetable for return of NBA Premium, Basketball TV to channel lineup |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=April 15, 2017 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=April 16, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2018, Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV returned to Sky Cable, Sky Direct, & Sky On Demand for the first time in 18 months<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-btv-channels-back-on-skycable-per-advisory-a795-20181016 |title=NBA Premium, BTV channels back on SKYCable, per advisory |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=October 16, 2018 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=October 26, 2018 |quote=}}</ref>; however it was later removed on October 28, 2018 for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mysky.com.ph/MetroManila/updates/1031/2018/10/28/sky-advisory|title=SKY Advisory|website=Me & My SKY: SKY at 25 years}}</ref>\n\nThe carriage dispute officially ended on January 1, 2019 when all Solar channels: Basketball TV, NBA Premium TV, Solar Sports, and Jack TV were restored on Sky Cable (including Sky On Demand & Sky Direct).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-and-btv-are-back-in-skycable-s-channel-lineup-a795-20190101|title=NBA Premium and BTV are back in SKYcable's channel lineup|website=Spin.ph}}</ref>\n\nIronically, [[MTVph]], which is a Solar channel, ended its operations on the same day at that time Sky returned the affected Solar channels. As of 2019, Sky Cable's sister company Destiny Cable still does not carry all the aforementioned Solar channels despite its aforementioned return on Sky Cable.\n\nDuring the aforementioned period, [[Shop TV]], ETC and 2nd Avenue (now defunct) were kept on the air, due to the \"must-carry\" rules by the NTC. MTVph was also kept on the air (until it was discontinued on January 1, 2019) since it was carried in a separate programming agreement outside of the affected channels despite its ownership.\n\n===Dream Satellite TV===\n[[Dream Satellite TV]] ceased carrying three Solar Channels, namely [[Solar Sports]], [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] (which was at that time a cable channel prior to its move to free TV and cable) and [[2nd Avenue (TV channel)|2nd Avenue]] (now defunct) (except [[C/S 9]]) effective 1 February 2009. Dream's carriage contract with Solar Entertainment, which expired on 31 December 2008 was not renewed by Dream, citing financial constraints as its main reason. The three Solar channels were replaced by A&E's [[History (South East Asian TV channel)|The History Channel]], [[Bio. (South East Asia)|Biography Channel]] and [[Crime & Investigation Network (South East Asia)|Crime and Investigation Channel]]. As of 2017, ETC and 2nd Avenue remained on its lineup due to the \"must-carry\" rules of the NTC. \n\nUnfortunately, Dream Satellite ended its operations on December 31, 2017 due to bankruptcy and its competition with other satellite providers.\n\n==Divisions / Subsidiaries==\n* ETC Productions<!-- ETC Productions is a production arm of the female-oriented TV channel, ETC -->\n* Blink\n* Solar Pictures\n* Domestic Satellite Philippines, Inc.

The move was a result of [[SkyCable]] pulling out C/S, ETC, and 2nd Avenue from the cable company's lineup at their own right. Those three started carrying shows from Solar's, with [[C/S]] on RPN, [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|ETC]] on SBN, and [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]] on RJTV.\n\n[[File:Solar Sports.png|200px|thumb|left| Former logo of [[Solar Sports]]]]\nOn May 22, 2009, a victory party for [[Manny Pacquiao|Manny \"Pacman\" Pacquiao]], who just became the new IBO (International Boxing Organization) and ''Ring Magazine'' Light Welterweight Champion, was held at the Renaissance Hotel in [[Makati City]], in partnership with [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Solar and [[GMA Network|GMA]] executives at that time signed for a partnership in TV coverage of Manny Pacquiao's upcoming boxing matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/photos/1295/gma-victory-party-for-manny-pac-man-pacquiao|title=GMA victory party for Manny 'Pac-Man' Pacquiao|author=|date=|work=PEP.ph|access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe C/S cable channel was later rebranded as [[C/S Origin]] in September 2008, while the RPN network later changed its branding to [[C/S 9]] the next month.\n\nOn November 29, 2009, Solar rebranded C/S9 as [[Solar TV]] at 11:00 am with a slogan ''It's A Bright New World'' on RPN.

In February 2012, both services aired a promotion, announcing the split of CHASE and TGC to form themselves as separate channels. On February 15, 2012, The Game Channel finally shuts down on free TV and was relaunched as a cable channel; CHASE was also relaunched as a separate channel, now occupying the entire BEAM broadcast airtime on Free TV.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Solar transferred its former Salcedo Village facilities to their new facility in Worldwide Corporate Center in [[Mandaluyong|Mandaluyong City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2012/04/solar-news-update-debuts-new-look.html|title=Solar News Update debuts new look|website=Medianewser.com}}</ref> It also featured a newly constructed set for Solar's then-news division, which would become fully functional three months later.\n\nOn July 16, 2012, Solar News launched its first local newscast ''Solar Network News'', followed by ''Solar Nightly News'', an hourly Solar News Update, Solar Daybreak, and Solar Newsday.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, Jack TV plugged their announcement through CHASE programs bearing the title \"Another Jack TV is rising, coming soon on this channel\" (BEAM Channel 31). This indicated that CHASE was being replaced; finally, on October 20, 2012, Jack City was then launched, marking October 19 as the end of CHASE's broadcasts. [[Jack City]] still does carry some of CHASE's programs however.\n\nIn October 2012, it was found out that Solar News would replace the government-controlled RPN News, as a result of RPN's privatization, making Solar TV covering the entire network's airtime. More than 200 RPN employees, particularly those from the labor union and the NewsWatch staff, were retrenched and RPN News was closed down on October 29, effectively axing NewsWatch and NewsCap. Some retrenched government employees were relocated to either [[People's Television Network|People's Television Network (PTV 4)]] or [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC 13)]] (both State-run broadcasters).\n\n[[File:FvfOmbudsman0222 37.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A [[Toyota HiAce]] van used by Solar News parked at the Office of the Ombudsman.]]\nOn October 30, 2012, at 5:45 am, TalkTV was replaced as Solar News Channel on Channel 21 via [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]]. The channel saw the relaunch of sports news program ''Solar Sports Desk'' (now known as [[Sports Desk (2004 TV series)|CNN Philippines Sports Desk]]), as well as the initial telecast of the Solar News and Current affairs block in November 2012 comprising five public affairs programs ([[Legal Help Desk|Legal HD]], [[MedTalk]], [[News.PH]], [[Opposing Views]], Elections 2013 and [[News Cafe]]), ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', ''[[Undercover Boss (U.S. TV series)|Undercover Boss]]'' and the \"Stories\" [[documentary film|documentaries]] block. In January 2013, Solar News Cebuano (now known as [[CNN Philippines Cebuano News]]) made history as the first national newscast delivered in a local dialect. In 2014, it also launched the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] national newscast, [[Kapampangan News]] and the public service program ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]'', which is shown in [[Filipino language]].\n\nPrior to the channel's transfer to RPN, SNC's flagship newscast (Solar Network News) simulcasted on RPN 9 (free TV only) from the SNC's launch. The news content for RPN (then affiliated with ETC), however, was switched to ''Solar Nightly News'' on January 14, 2013, onwards, to avoid backlash from free TV viewers, particularly Free TV viewers of ''[[American Idol]]'' (in which the original plan was to replace the 6 pm via satellite broadcast to Free TV viewers by Network News, then airs the AI episodes at the 8 pm rerun in simulcast with cable and satellite viewers). Throughout the ''American Idol'' season, as the episodes are repeated at 8 PM on cable, Solar used the separate free TV-only feed, that contains reruns of selected ETC shows (but with advertisements replaced by ETC teasers and promotions) at 8&nbsp;pm and ''Nightly News'' at 9 PM (with additional ETC programs, if necessary) to be used by RPN after each AI via satellite episode before RPN returns to the main ETC feed at 10 PM. This is to retain RPN's news content as it then has no newscast since the axing of NewsWatch.\n\nOn January 3, 2013, SEC launched Blink Cinema (later renamed as [[My Movie Channel]]) with the full broadcast taking effect later that month.\n\nOn April 14, 2013, [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5 Network Inc.]] and Solar Entertainment Corporation joined to broadcast the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]] in Manila on Philippine television on August 1\u201311.

However, Jack City continued to broadcast on cable networks until March 21, 2015.

The four networks unveiled their new logos, on-air graphics and station IDs, which took effect on that day. CT, Jack TV, Shop TV and NBA Premium TV on the other hand remains unchanged. Also that day, Solar launched its corporate campaign slogan ''...There's More To Come'', which evolved in 2017 as ''We go for More''.\n\nIn 2017, Solar Entertainment became the official Philippine broadcaster of the 65th edition of the [[Miss Universe]] in Manila. This led to another deal with [[ABS-CBN]], [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] and [[GMA Network|GMA]] (the second time that such deal happened between Solar and the Big 3 networks). According to some sources, a directive from [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Duterte]] ordered that the major networks must cover the prestige pageant as it happens live in the [[Philippines]]. Alongside the Big Three, Solar Entertainment channels [[ETC (Philippine TV network)|etc]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Jack TV]] and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] aired the pageant simultaneously. It was also in the same year when Solar Entertainment forged a joint venture with the Bermuda-based communications satellite company [[Asia Broadcast Satellite]] to launch the first nationwide free-to-air [[Satellite television#Direct broadcast via satellite|direct-to-home]] satellite television services using the [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]], which is set to launch on the 3rd quarter of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/broadcasting/2017/05/22/abs-solar-group-launch-new-dth-service-philippines/|title=ABS, The Solar Group to Launch New DTH Service in the Philippines|author=Kendall Russell|date=May 22, 2017|work=Satellite Today|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Carriage disputes==\n===Sky Cable===\n====2008====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSolar's channels have ceased airing on [[Sky Cable]], the Philippines' largest cable television provider. An insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that these troubles with Sky Cable started when boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], whose fights Solar Entertainment has the exclusive right to air and distribute to, moved from [[ABS-CBN]], the flagship television network of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]] and the primary owner of [[Sky Cable Corporation]], to rival [[GMA Network]]. Another insider{{Who|date=April 2017}} claims that SkyCable wanted to remove [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and [[Jack TV]] to make room for their own channels, [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]] (now defunct) and [[Maxxx]] (now defunct). Sky Cable wanted to retain [[C/S]], [[2nd Avenue (television channel)|2nd Avenue]], [[Solar Sports]] and [[Basketball TV]], but Solar made a decision that they would only renew their contract if Sky Cable carried all six channels. Thus, Solar decided to pull out all their channels rather than remove ETC and Jack TV.\n\nHowever, Solar has signed a deal with local terrestrial channels [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC]], [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]], [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN]] and [[Rajah Broadcasting Network|RJTV]] for block-time programming. C/S, ETC and 2nd Avenue programming are seen on terrestrial TV channels RPN, SBN and RJTV, respectively, while [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[WWE]] programming were seen on TV5, now moved to RPN (WWE programming are currently being broadcast thru TV5, while its terrestrial NBA coverage were moved to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] under Solar).\n\nMost of its channels were later returned to Sky Cable, while Jack TV would eventually return to its lineup on January 1, 2010 replacing Maxxx.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacquiao's boxing promotion, [[Top Rank]], signed a non-guaranteed contract with [[ABS-CBN Sports]] to exclusively air fights promoted by Top Rank, with the exception of Pacquiao fights which are still signed exclusively through Solar Entertainment.\n\n====2017\u201319====\nOn April 10, 2017, 3 days before the [[2017 NBA Playoffs]] was scheduled to begin (and coincided with the final day of the [[2016\u201317 NBA season|2016\u201317 NBA regular season]]), Basketball TV, [[NBA Premium TV]], Solar Sports, Jack TV and [[CT (TV channel)|CT]] (now defunct) were removed by Solar from Sky Cable (including [[Sky Direct]], [[Destiny Cable]] & [[Sky On Demand]] thru video on demand) without any prior announcement from Solar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/nba/167065-sky-nba-premium-btv-unavailable |title=Sky subscribers frustrated as NBA Premium, BTV unavailable for playoffs start |last= Rola|first=Alyssa |date= April 16, 2017|website=[[Rappler]] |access-date= April 16, 2017|quote=}}</ref> Initially, both Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV were replaced by airing a simulcast of [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]] with a ticker announcing the unavailability of the channels, with Solar Sports, Jack TV and CT (now defunct) also doing the latter albeit with a black screen. Later, almost all of the pulled-out Solar channels were replaced by an imaging card, initially detailing the unavailability of the channels and then later, announcing that they will discuss with Solar on returning the aforementioned channels; while for BTV and NBA Premium TV, a schedule of the NBA games that will air on [[ABS-CBN]], ABS-CBN Sports and Action and [[Fox Sports Asia|Fox Sports]] within the week and a loop of an NBA promo. Solar did not comment on the situation for the removal of the channels, but sources and some netizens pointed out a carriage dispute between the two parties for not paying an undisclosed price to continue broadcasting these channels, which was later proven true by an article published by the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''.\n\nAs the dispute continued, some media enthusiasts and netizens raised concerns of whether these Solar channels will return to Sky and/or Destiny. Others pointed that inaction between the two parties could affect the next long-term local broadcast franchise with the NBA, slated to begin at the Association's 2019-2020 regular season. (Currently, Solar and Sky's parent, ABS-CBN, have a shared broadcast agreement to air the NBA games on pay and terrestrial television, respectively. Rumours circulated that both networks may bid separately, if they could not reach renewal, and use their respective infrastructure to broadcast adequate NBA coverage; otherwise, rival networks with a functioning sports department like [[5 (TV channel)|The 5 Network]] may also seek their own bidding to steal the 2019 contract from both Solar and ABS-CBN.)\n\nNetizens and viewers were dismayed and frustrated by the removal of the said channels by Sky Cable, most notably for BTV and NBA Premium due to the importance of the Playoffs. Some netizens were angered by the removal of the said channels and asked Sky Cable to return the channels before the scheduled Playoffs would begin, however Sky Cable would respond to angered netizens on social media that they are \"fixing the situation with Solar\". Other netizens and viewers would otherwise switch providers from Sky Cable to other cable companies that carried these channels or to other satellite providers like [[Cignal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/news/sky-cable-nba-premium-basketball-tv-negotiations-with-solar |title=SKYcable unable to give timetable for return of NBA Premium, Basketball TV to channel lineup |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=April 15, 2017 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=April 16, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2018, Basketball TV and NBA Premium TV returned to Sky Cable, Sky Direct, & Sky On Demand for the first time in 18 months<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-btv-channels-back-on-skycable-per-advisory-a795-20181016 |title=NBA Premium, BTV channels back on SKYCable, per advisory |last=Terrado |first=Reuben |date=October 16, 2018 |website=[[GMA New Media|Spin.ph]] |access-date=October 26, 2018 |quote=}}</ref>; however it was later removed on October 28, 2018 for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mysky.com.ph/MetroManila/updates/1031/2018/10/28/sky-advisory|title=SKY Advisory|website=Me & My SKY: SKY at 25 years}}</ref>\n\nThe carriage dispute officially ended on January 1, 2019 when all Solar channels: Basketball TV, NBA Premium TV, Solar Sports, and Jack TV were restored on Sky Cable (including Sky On Demand & Sky Direct).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.ph/basketball/nba/nba-premium-and-btv-are-back-in-skycable-s-channel-lineup-a795-20190101|title=NBA Premium and BTV are back in SKYcable's channel lineup|website=Spin.ph}}</ref>\n\nIronically, [[MTVph]], which is a Solar channel, ended its operations on the same day at that time Sky returned the affected Solar channels. As of 2019, Sky Cable's sister company Destiny Cable still does not carry all the aforementioned Solar channels despite its aforementioned return on Sky Cable.\n\nDuring the aforementioned period, [[Shop TV]], ETC and 2nd Avenue (now defunct) were kept on the air, due to the \"must-carry\" rules by the NTC. MTVph was also kept on the air (until it was discontinued on January 1, 2019) since it was carried in a separate programming agreement outside of the affected channels despite its ownership.\n\n===Dream Satellite TV===\n[[Dream Satellite TV]] ceased carrying three Solar Channels, namely [[Solar Sports]], [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] (which was at that time a cable channel prior to its move to free TV and cable) and [[2nd Avenue (TV channel)|2nd Avenue]] (now defunct) (except [[C/S 9]]) effective 1 February 2009. Dream's carriage contract with Solar Entertainment, which expired on 31 December 2008 was not renewed by Dream, citing financial constraints as its main reason. The three Solar channels were replaced by A&E's [[History (South East Asian TV channel)|The History Channel]], [[Bio. (South East Asia)|Biography Channel]] and [[Crime & Investigation Network (South East Asia)|Crime and Investigation Channel]]. As of 2017, ETC and 2nd Avenue remained on its lineup due to the \"must-carry\" rules of the NTC. \n\nUnfortunately, Dream Satellite ended its operations on December 31, 2017 due to bankruptcy and its competition with other satellite providers.\n\n==Divisions / Subsidiaries==\n* ETC Productions<!-- ETC Productions is a production arm of the female-oriented TV channel, ETC -->\n* Blink\n* Solar Pictures\n* Domestic Satellite Philippines, Inc.
