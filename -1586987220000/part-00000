The very fact that it was part of an \"establishment\" institution such as the [[BBC]] was a turn-off for some, and [[needle time]] restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.\n\nDespite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened-to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20&nbsp;million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early to mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work. The touring summer live broadcasts called the [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] \u2013 usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road \u2013 drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[Manx Radio]] in the Isle of Man. ([[Independent Local Radio]] did not begin until October 1973, took many years to cover virtually all of the UK and was initially a mixture of music and talk). [[Alan Freeman]]'s \"Saturday Rock Show\" was voted \"Best Radio Show\" five years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.\n\n[[Annie Nightingale]], who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/annie_nightingale_page.htm|title=BBC Radio 1 People \u2013 Annie Nightingale \u2013 Hi|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn Thursday, 23 November 1978, the station moved to two new medium wave frequencies (275m and 285m), which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved coverage of the UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on medium wave only until the early '80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency for a number of hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings. Eventually the BBC set up an FM channel specifically for Radio 1 and, after a number of years of parallel broadcasting, relinquished the medium wave frequencies.\n\n===1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n\nAt the start of 1981, [[Mike Read]] took over [[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]] from [[Dave Lee Travis]]. Towards the end of the year, [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] started the long-running [[Steve Wright in the Afternoon]] show. In 1982, the new [[Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show]] started, initially with [[Tony Blackburn]] supported by [[Maggie Philpin]] and [[Keith Chegwin]]. Adrian John and [[Pat Sharp]] also join for the early weekend shows. [[Gary Davies]] and [[Janice Long]] also join, hosting Saturday night late and evening shows respectively.\n\nIn 1984, [[Robbie Vincent]] joins to host a Sunday evening soul show. With [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] leaves for a while to present on BBC TV's [[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]], Gary Davies then takes over weekday lunchtime slot. [[Bruno Brookes]] joins and replaces [[Peter Powell (DJ)|Peter Powell]] as presenter of the teatime show, with Powell replacing Blackburn on the weekend breakfast.\n\nIn March 1985, [[Ranking Miss P]] becomes the first black female DJ on the station, hosting a reggae programme. In July, [[Andy Kershaw]] also joins the station.\n\n[[Simon Mayo]] joins the station in 1986, whilst Smith rejoins to replace Read on the breakfast show.\n\nIn response to the growth in dance and rap music, Jeff Young joins in October 1987 with the Big Beat show. At the end of the year, [[Nicky Campbell]], [[Mark Goodier]], and [[Liz Kershaw]] all join.\n\nMayo replaces Smith on the breakfast show in May 1988. In September, Goodier and Kershaw take over weekend breakfasts with Powell departing. Campbell takes over weekdays.\n\nFrom September 1988, Radio 1 begins its [[FM broadcasting|FM]] switch-on, with further rollout across the country through 1989.\n\n===1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn 1992, Radio 1, for the first and only time, covered a [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]]. Their coverage was presented by [[Nicky Campbell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/98004ab354d34abd8fad4fbf09a9b331|title=Nicky Campbell's Election Special|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under [[Matthew Bannister]]. One of these \"[[Loud'n'proud]]\" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in [[Manchester]] and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor [[Gay Pride]] event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '[[Smashie and Nicey]]' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as [[Simon Bates]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]], [[Paul Gambaccini]] [[Gary Davies]], and later [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Bruno Brookes]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] left the station or were dismissed, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was dropped from the daytime [[playlist]].\n\nMany listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, [[BBC GLR|GLR]]) with [[Emma Freud]] and [[Danny Baker]]. Another problem was that, at the time, [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], and commercial radio, which was targeting the \"Radio 1 and a half\" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.\n\nAfter the departure of [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular presenter who was eventually dismissed in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by [[Mark and Lard]] \u2013 [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] (along with his sidekick [[Marc Riley]]), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by [[Zoe Ball]] and [[Kevin Greening]] eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of [[Britpop]] in the mid-90s \u2013 bands like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's \"Lost in Music\" which looked at the influence that the use of drugs have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside [[Broadcasting House]].\n\nLater in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop ([[boy bands]] and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of [[rave]] culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ [[Pete Tong]] amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the [[Essential Mix]] where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Seb Fontaine]] all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in [[Ibiza]].\n\n===2000s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Lamacq whiley lowe.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Zane Lowe]]\n\nListening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as [[The Surgery]], [[Bobby Friction]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]]'s show, ''The Evening Session'' and its successor [[Zane Lowe]]'s show. Its website has also been well received.\n\nHowever, the breakfast show and the [[UK Top 40]] continued to struggle. In 2000, Zoe Ball was replaced in the mornings by close friend and fellow [[ladette]] [[Sara Cox]], but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by [[Chris Moyles]]. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as [[The Chris Moyles Show]] and it increased its audience, ahead of [[Today programme|The Today Programme]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as the second most popular breakfast show (after [[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]] hosted by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the ''[[Wake Up to Wogan]]'' show. In 2006, for example, creating a ''SAY NO TO WOGAN'' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time \u2013 Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.\nThe chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host [[Mark Goodier]], amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Network Chart]] overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. Before July 2015, when the chart release day was changed to Friday, the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio's [[The Big Top 40 Show]] which was broadcast at the same time.\n\nMany DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]) have joined [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.\nThe success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, [[Scott Mills]] and [[Zane Lowe]] all won gold [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]], while the station itself came away with the best station award.\n\nA new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows.\n\nFollowing the death of [[John Peel]] in October 2004, [[Annie Nightingale]] is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.\n\n===2010s===\nThe licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]].<ref name=\"tel-nov2010\">{{cite news|first=Amanda|last=Andrews|date=28 November 2010|title=BBC enlists commercial sector help to shake up radio|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8164936/BBC-enlists-commercial-sector-help-to-shake-up-radio.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 March 2011|location=London}}</ref> His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was \"to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.\"<ref name=\"tel-nov2010\"/>\n\nThe controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt.

These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.\n\nIn 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from [[Broadcasting House]] to [[Egton House]]. The station moved to [[Yalding House]] in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.\n\nUntil recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on [[Great Portland Street]] in [[central London]]. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the \"[[Live Lounge]]\", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as [[Maida Vale Studios]] is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the \"Live Lounge\", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the \"Live Cam\". The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.\n\nIn December 2012, Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]], Portland Place, just a few metres away from the \"Peel Wing\", formerly the \"Egton Wing\", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the \"Peel Wing\" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, [[John Peel]], who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.\n\nProgrammes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably ''The Mark and Lard Show'', broadcast every weekday from [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Oxford Road, [[Manchester]] for over a decade (October 1993 \u2013 March 2004) \u2013 the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.\n\n===UK analogue frequencies===\nRadio 1 originally broadcast on 1214&nbsp;kHz [[medium wave]] (or 247 metres). On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to 1053 and 1089&nbsp;kHz (275 and 285 m), but did not broadcast nationally on its own FM frequencies until late 1987. The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 2]]), [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 3]]) and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]) stations. Thus when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2's]] FM transmitters for a few hours per week. These were Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening \u2013 most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons; 10{{nbsp}}pm to midnight on weeknights including [[Sounds of the Seventies]] until 1975, and thereafter the [[John Peel]] show (Mon\u2013Thurs) and the Friday Rock Show; and most Bank Holiday afternoons, when Radio 2 was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of [[5 live Sport|Sport on 2]].\n\nTo coincide with Radio 1's 20th birthday, the first full-time FM broadcast began in the London area on 31 October 1987, at low power on 104.8&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/images/transmitfm_sht1.jpg|title=Plans for Radio 1 FM services introduction|publisher=Radiorewind.co.uk|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> A year later the FM frequencies became national after the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97\u201399 FM, which the BBC acquired. The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England. A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended. Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995. The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995.\n\nThe Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to [[Independent National Radio]]. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with [[Stephen Duffy]]'s \"Kiss Me\" being the last record played on MW just before 9{{nbsp}}am. For those who continued to listen, just after 9{{nbsp}}am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with [[Mark Goodier]] was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an \"FM-only\" station.<ref name=\"Radio 1 transmitter AM switchoff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm|title=Radio 1 History \u2013 Transmitters|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television's]] analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]]) and later in stereo (on [[Sky Living|UK Living]]).\n\n===Digital distribution===\nThe BBC launched its national radio stations on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was \"officially\" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] began [[simulcast]]ing Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on [[Dish Network]] satellite TV. [[Sirius Canada]] began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were [[Time shifting|time shifted]] five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]] to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_SIR_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=Sirius Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_XM_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=XM Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6&nbsp;million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone.\nBBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.\n\n===SiriusXM cancellation in North America===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2013}}\nAt midnight on 9 August 2011, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning.

Most recently, these shows were under the [[BBC Introducing]] brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.\n\nFrom January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592r |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing in Scotland with Ally McCrae |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously it was hosted by [[Vic Galloway]] (who also presents for [[BBC Radio Scotland]]); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed.\n\nWales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592p |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing in Wales with Jen Long |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously [[Bethan Elfyn]] occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens,<ref name=\"regions98\">{{cite web|url=http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |title=Frequency Finder UK \u2013 Classic Radio 1 schedules |publisher=Frequencyfinder.org.uk |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111133603/http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}</ref> until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales \u2013 a Welsh-language music show on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] on Thursday evenings.\n\nPhil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by [[Rory McConnell]]. Before joining the national network, [[Colin Murray]] was a presenter on ''The Session'' in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;<ref name=\"regions98\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |title=Who is Colin Murray? |publisher=Culturenorthernireland.org |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110024216/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |archivedate=10 November 2014 }}</ref> after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.\n\nThe regional opt-outs originally went out from 8{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm on Thursdays (the ''Evening Session''{{'}}s time slot) and were known as the \"Session in the Nations\" (the \"Session\" tag was later dropped due to the demise of the ''Evening Session''); they later moved to run from 7:30{{nbsp}}pm to 9{{nbsp}}pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am under the ''BBC Introducing'' banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.\n\nThe opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.\n\nThe [[BBC Trust]] announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single ''BBC Introducing'' show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jk7zb |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing with Jen and Ally |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n=== Music ===\nBecause of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a broad mix of current and potential future hits, including [[indie rock|independent]]/[[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip hop]], rock, dance/[[electronica]] and pop. This made the station stand out from other [[contemporary hit radio|top 40]] stations, both in the UK and across the world.\n\nDue to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the \"[[needle time]]\" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many of them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for [[John Peel]]'s late night programme are particularly renowned.\n\nThe station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for \"waffling\" by presenters, an experimental \"more music day\" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.\n\n===News and current affairs===\n{{Main|Newsbeat}}\nRadio 1 has a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]] obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through [[Newsbeat]] bulletins throughout the day. Shared with [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two additional 15-minute bulletins at select times. The main presenter is Ben Mundy, with Roisin Hastie presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Newly announced Newsbeat presenters say reading bulletins on BBC Radio 1 is 'dream come true' |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/newly-announced-newsbeat-presenters-say-reading-bulletins-on-bbc-radio-1-is-dream-come-true/ |magazine=Press Gazette |accessdate=27 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Online visualisation and social media===\nIn recent years Radio 1 has used social media to help reach a younger audience.

In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded ''[[Radio 1's Big Weekend|One Big Weekend]]'', with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, as part of the ''Music Lives'' campaign, and [[Perry Park (Birmingham)|Perry Park]] in Birmingham.\n\nThe most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]]. Venues under this title have included [[Herrington]] Country Park, [[Camperdown Country Park]], [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]]\u2013which was the first ''Weekend'' to feature a third stage\u2013[[Mote Park]], [[Lydiard Park]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Airport]].\n\nTickets for each ''Big Weekend'' are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/|title=Radio 1 announced line-up for One Big Weekend, Preston|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080218203420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/| archivedate= 18 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nBBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The Hackney Weekend took place over the weekend of 23\u201324 June 2012 in [[Hackney Marshes]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London.

So far, Derry is the only city to have hosted the Big Weekend twice.\n\nIn May 2014, Radio 1's Big Weekend was held in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Acts which played at the event included [[Rita Ora]], [[The 1975]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Jake Bugg]] and [[Pharrell Williams]].

The very fact that it was part of an \"establishment\" institution such as the [[BBC]] was a turn-off for some, and [[needle time]] restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.\n\nDespite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened-to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20&nbsp;million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early to mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work. The touring summer live broadcasts called the [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] \u2013 usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road \u2013 drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[Manx Radio]] in the Isle of Man. ([[Independent Local Radio]] did not begin until October 1973, took many years to cover virtually all of the UK and was initially a mixture of music and talk). [[Alan Freeman]]'s \"Saturday Rock Show\" was voted \"Best Radio Show\" five years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.\n\n[[Annie Nightingale]], who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/annie_nightingale_page.htm|title=BBC Radio 1 People \u2013 Annie Nightingale \u2013 Hi|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn Thursday, 23 November 1978, the station moved to two new medium wave frequencies (275m and 285m), which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved coverage of the UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on medium wave only until the early '80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency for a number of hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings. Eventually the BBC set up an FM channel specifically for Radio 1 and, after a number of years of parallel broadcasting, relinquished the medium wave frequencies.\n\n===1980s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n\nAt the start of 1981, [[Mike Read]] took over [[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]] from [[Dave Lee Travis]]. Towards the end of the year, [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] started the long-running [[Steve Wright in the Afternoon]] show. In 1982, the new [[Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show]] started, initially with [[Tony Blackburn]] supported by [[Maggie Philpin]] and [[Keith Chegwin]]. Adrian John and [[Pat Sharp]] also join for the early weekend shows. [[Gary Davies]] and [[Janice Long]] also join, hosting Saturday night late and evening shows respectively.\n\nIn 1984, [[Robbie Vincent]] joins to host a Sunday evening soul show. With [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] leaves for a while to present on BBC TV's [[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]], Gary Davies then takes over weekday lunchtime slot. [[Bruno Brookes]] joins and replaces [[Peter Powell (DJ)|Peter Powell]] as presenter of the teatime show, with Powell replacing Blackburn on the weekend breakfast.\n\nIn March 1985, [[Ranking Miss P]] becomes the first black female DJ on the station, hosting a reggae programme. In July, [[Andy Kershaw]] also joins the station.\n\n[[Simon Mayo]] joins the station in 1986, whilst Smith rejoins to replace Read on the breakfast show.\n\nIn response to the growth in dance and rap music, Jeff Young joins in October 1987 with the Big Beat show. At the end of the year, [[Nicky Campbell]], [[Mark Goodier]], and [[Liz Kershaw]] all join.\n\nMayo replaces Smith on the breakfast show in May 1988. In September, Goodier and Kershaw take over weekend breakfasts with Powell departing. Campbell takes over weekdays.\n\nFrom September 1988, Radio 1 begins its [[FM broadcasting|FM]] switch-on, with further rollout across the country through 1989.\n\n===1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nIn 1992, Radio 1, for the first and only time, covered a [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]]. Their coverage was presented by [[Nicky Campbell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/98004ab354d34abd8fad4fbf09a9b331|title=Nicky Campbell's Election Special|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under [[Matthew Bannister]]. One of these \"[[Loud'n'proud]]\" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in [[Manchester]] and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor [[Gay Pride]] event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '[[Smashie and Nicey]]' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as [[Simon Bates]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]], [[Paul Gambaccini]] [[Gary Davies]], and later [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Bruno Brookes]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] left the station or were dismissed, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was dropped from the daytime [[playlist]].\n\nMany listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, [[BBC GLR|GLR]]) with [[Emma Freud]] and [[Danny Baker]]. Another problem was that, at the time, [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], and commercial radio, which was targeting the \"Radio 1 and a half\" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.\n\nAfter the departure of [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular presenter who was eventually dismissed in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by [[Mark and Lard]] \u2013 [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] (along with his sidekick [[Marc Riley]]), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by [[Zoe Ball]] and [[Kevin Greening]] eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of [[Britpop]] in the mid-90s \u2013 bands like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's \"Lost in Music\" which looked at the influence that the use of drugs have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside [[Broadcasting House]].\n\nLater in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop ([[boy bands]] and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of [[rave]] culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ [[Pete Tong]] amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the [[Essential Mix]] where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Seb Fontaine]] all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in [[Ibiza]].\n\n===2000s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Lamacq whiley lowe.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Zane Lowe]]\n\nListening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as [[The Surgery]], [[Bobby Friction]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]]'s show, ''The Evening Session'' and its successor [[Zane Lowe]]'s show. Its website has also been well received.\n\nHowever, the breakfast show and the [[UK Top 40]] continued to struggle. In 2000, Zoe Ball was replaced in the mornings by close friend and fellow [[ladette]] [[Sara Cox]], but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by [[Chris Moyles]]. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as [[The Chris Moyles Show]] and it increased its audience, ahead of [[Today programme|The Today Programme]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as the second most popular breakfast show (after [[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]] hosted by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the ''[[Wake Up to Wogan]]'' show. In 2006, for example, creating a ''SAY NO TO WOGAN'' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time \u2013 Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.\nThe chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host [[Mark Goodier]], amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Network Chart]] overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. Before July 2015, when the chart release day was changed to Friday, the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio's [[The Big Top 40 Show]] which was broadcast at the same time.\n\nMany DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]) have joined [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.\nThe success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, [[Scott Mills]] and [[Zane Lowe]] all won gold [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]], while the station itself came away with the best station award.\n\nA new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows.\n\nFollowing the death of [[John Peel]] in October 2004, [[Annie Nightingale]] is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.\n\n===2010s===\nThe licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]].<ref name=\"tel-nov2010\">{{cite news|first=Amanda|last=Andrews|date=28 November 2010|title=BBC enlists commercial sector help to shake up radio|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8164936/BBC-enlists-commercial-sector-help-to-shake-up-radio.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 March 2011|location=London}}</ref> His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was \"to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.\"<ref name=\"tel-nov2010\"/>\n\nThe controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt.

These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.\n\nIn 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from [[Broadcasting House]] to [[Egton House]]. The station moved to [[Yalding House]] in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.\n\nUntil recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on [[Great Portland Street]] in [[central London]]. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the \"[[Live Lounge]]\", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as [[Maida Vale Studios]] is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the \"Live Lounge\", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the \"Live Cam\". The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.\n\nIn December 2012, Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]], Portland Place, just a few metres away from the \"Peel Wing\", formerly the \"Egton Wing\", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the \"Peel Wing\" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, [[John Peel]], who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.\n\nProgrammes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably ''The Mark and Lard Show'', broadcast every weekday from [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Oxford Road, [[Manchester]] for over a decade (October 1993 \u2013 March 2004) \u2013 the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.\n\n===UK analogue frequencies===\nRadio 1 originally broadcast on 1214&nbsp;kHz [[medium wave]] (or 247 metres). On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to 1053 and 1089&nbsp;kHz (275 and 285 m), but did not broadcast nationally on its own FM frequencies until late 1987. The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 2]]), [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 3]]) and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]) stations. Thus when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2's]] FM transmitters for a few hours per week. These were Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening \u2013 most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons; 10{{nbsp}}pm to midnight on weeknights including [[Sounds of the Seventies]] until 1975, and thereafter the [[John Peel]] show (Mon\u2013Thurs) and the Friday Rock Show; and most Bank Holiday afternoons, when Radio 2 was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of [[5 live Sport|Sport on 2]].\n\nTo coincide with Radio 1's 20th birthday, the first full-time FM broadcast began in the London area on 31 October 1987, at low power on 104.8&nbsp;MHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/images/transmitfm_sht1.jpg|title=Plans for Radio 1 FM services introduction|publisher=Radiorewind.co.uk|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> A year later the FM frequencies became national after the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97\u201399 FM, which the BBC acquired. The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England. A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended. Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995. The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995.\n\nThe Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to [[Independent National Radio]]. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with [[Stephen Duffy]]'s \"Kiss Me\" being the last record played on MW just before 9{{nbsp}}am. For those who continued to listen, just after 9{{nbsp}}am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with [[Mark Goodier]] was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an \"FM-only\" station.<ref name=\"Radio 1 transmitter AM switchoff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm|title=Radio 1 History \u2013 Transmitters|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television's]] analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]]) and later in stereo (on [[Sky Living|UK Living]]).\n\n===Digital distribution===\nThe BBC launched its national radio stations on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was \"officially\" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] began [[simulcast]]ing Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on [[Dish Network]] satellite TV. [[Sirius Canada]] began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were [[Time shifting|time shifted]] five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]] to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_SIR_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=Sirius Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_XM_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=XM Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6&nbsp;million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone.\nBBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.\n\n===SiriusXM cancellation in North America===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2013}}\nAt midnight on 9 August 2011, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning.

Most recently, these shows were under the [[BBC Introducing]] brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.\n\nFrom January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592r |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing in Scotland with Ally McCrae |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously it was hosted by [[Vic Galloway]] (who also presents for [[BBC Radio Scotland]]); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed.\n\nWales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592p |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing in Wales with Jen Long |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> Previously [[Bethan Elfyn]] occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens,<ref name=\"regions98\">{{cite web|url=http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |title=Frequency Finder UK \u2013 Classic Radio 1 schedules |publisher=Frequencyfinder.org.uk |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111133603/http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |archivedate=11 November 2013 }}</ref> until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales \u2013 a Welsh-language music show on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] on Thursday evenings.\n\nPhil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by [[Rory McConnell]]. Before joining the national network, [[Colin Murray]] was a presenter on ''The Session'' in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;<ref name=\"regions98\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |title=Who is Colin Murray? |publisher=Culturenorthernireland.org |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110024216/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |archivedate=10 November 2014 }}</ref> after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.\n\nThe regional opt-outs originally went out from 8{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm on Thursdays (the ''Evening Session''{{'}}s time slot) and were known as the \"Session in the Nations\" (the \"Session\" tag was later dropped due to the demise of the ''Evening Session''); they later moved to run from 7:30{{nbsp}}pm to 9{{nbsp}}pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am under the ''BBC Introducing'' banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.\n\nThe opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.\n\nThe [[BBC Trust]] announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single ''BBC Introducing'' show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jk7zb |title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 BBC Introducing with Jen and Ally |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n=== Music ===\nBecause of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a broad mix of current and potential future hits, including [[indie rock|independent]]/[[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip hop]], rock, dance/[[electronica]] and pop. This made the station stand out from other [[contemporary hit radio|top 40]] stations, both in the UK and across the world.\n\nDue to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the \"[[needle time]]\" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many of them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for [[John Peel]]'s late night programme are particularly renowned.\n\nThe station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for \"waffling\" by presenters, an experimental \"more music day\" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.\n\n===News and current affairs===\n{{Main|Newsbeat}}\nRadio 1 has a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]] obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through [[Newsbeat]] bulletins throughout the day. Shared with [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two additional 15-minute bulletins at select times. The main presenter is Ben Mundy, with Roisin Hastie presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Newly announced Newsbeat presenters say reading bulletins on BBC Radio 1 is 'dream come true' |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/newly-announced-newsbeat-presenters-say-reading-bulletins-on-bbc-radio-1-is-dream-come-true/ |magazine=Press Gazette |accessdate=27 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Online visualisation and social media===\nIn recent years Radio 1 has used social media to help reach a younger audience.

In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded ''[[Radio 1's Big Weekend|One Big Weekend]]'', with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, as part of the ''Music Lives'' campaign, and [[Perry Park (Birmingham)|Perry Park]] in Birmingham.\n\nThe most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]]. Venues under this title have included [[Herrington]] Country Park, [[Camperdown Country Park]], [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]]\u2013which was the first ''Weekend'' to feature a third stage\u2013[[Mote Park]], [[Lydiard Park]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Airport]].\n\nTickets for each ''Big Weekend'' are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/|title=Radio 1 announced line-up for One Big Weekend, Preston|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080218203420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/| archivedate= 18 February 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nBBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000.
