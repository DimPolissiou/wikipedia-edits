{"title_page": "Exhaled nitric oxide", "text_new": "[[Image:Nitric-oxide-2D.png|thumb|Chemical formula of nitric oxide (NO) together with its molecular size (115 [[picometer|pm]]).]]\nIn [[medicine]], '''exhaled nitric oxide''' (eNO) can be measured in a [[breath test]] for [[asthma]] or other conditions characterized by [[airway]] [[inflammation]]. [[Nitric oxide]] (NO) is a gaseous [[molecule]] produced by certain [[Cell (biology)|cell]] types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FE<sub>NO</sub>) is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma. The breath test has recently become available in many well-equipped hospitals in developed countries, although its exact role remains unclear.\n\n==Biology==\n{{main|nitric oxide synthase}}\n[[Image:Nitric-oxide-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Three-dimensional model of NO.]]\nIn humans, nitric oxide is produced from [[L-arginine]] by three [[enzymes]] called [[nitric oxide synthase]]s (NOS): inducible (iNOS), endothelial ([[Endothelial NOS|eNOS]]), and neuronal (nNOS). The latter two are constantly active in [[endothelial cell]]s and [[neuron]]s respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by [[cytokines]]). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including [[eosinophils]]. As such, eNO (also known as FeNO \"fractional exhaled nitric oxide\") has been dubbed an ''inflammometer''.<ref name=\"pmid18076708\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pijnenburg MW, De Jongste JC | title = Exhaled nitric oxide in childhood asthma: a review | journal = Clinical and Experimental Allergy | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 246\u201359 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18076708 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02897.x }}</ref>\n\nAlthough iNOS is thought to be the main contributor to exhaled NO in asthmatics,<ref name=\"pmid15333851\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lane C, Knight D, Burgess S, Franklin P, Horak F, Legg J, Moeller A, Stick S | display-authors = 6 | title = Epithelial inducible nitric oxide synthase activity is the major determinant of nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath | journal = Thorax | volume = 59 | issue = 9 | pages = 757\u201360 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15333851 | pmc = 1747143 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2003.014894 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17550932\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brindicci C, Ito K, Barnes PJ, Kharitonov SA | title = Effect of an inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on differential flow-exhaled nitric oxide in asthmatic patients and healthy volunteers | journal = Chest | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 581\u20138 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17550932 | doi = 10.1378/chest.06-3046 | url = http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17550932 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130414115604/http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17550932 | archive-date = 2013-04-14 }}</ref> studies in mice also point to a role for nNOS.<ref name=\"pmid10330441\">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Sanctis GT, MacLean JA, Hamada K, Mehta S, Scott JA, Jiao A, Yandava CN, Kobzik L, Wolyniec WW, Fabian AJ, Venugopal CS, Grasemann H, Huang PL, Drazen JM | display-authors = 6 | title = Contribution of nitric oxide synthases 1, 2, and 3 to airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in a murine model of asthma | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 189 | issue = 10 | pages = 1621\u201330 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10330441 | pmc = 2193630 | doi = 10.1084/jem.189.10.1621 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid9357865\">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Sanctis GT, Mehta S, Kobzik L, Yandava C, Jiao A, Huang PL, Drazen JM | title = Contribution of type I NOS to expired gas NO and bronchial responsiveness in mice | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 273 | issue = 4 | pages = L883-8 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9357865 | doi = 10.1152/ajplung.1997.273.4.L883 | url = http://ajplung.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9357865 }}</ref>\n\nIt was initially thought that exhaled NO derived mostly from the sinuses, which contain high levels of NO.

[[Nitric oxide]] (NO) is a gaseous [[molecule]] produced by certain [[Cell (biology)|cell]] types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FE<sub>NO</sub>) is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma.

The latter two are constantly active in [[endothelial cell]]s and [[neuron]]s respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by [[cytokines]]). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including [[eosinophils]].
