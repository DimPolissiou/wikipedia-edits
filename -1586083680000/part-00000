Reportedly, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nLater at a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that the gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a hunting cartridge that would not be able to detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, [[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]], 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Reportedly, Tkachenko insisted that it was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nLater at a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that the gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a hunting cartridge that would not be able to detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, [[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]], 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

The lower two thirds of the lobes are connected by a thin band of [[Connective tissue|tissue]] called the thyroid isthmus. The thyroid is located at the front of the neck, below the [[Adam's apple]]. Microscopically, the functional unit of the thyroid gland is the spherical [[thyroid follicle]], lined with [[thyroid follicular cell|follicular cells]] (thyrocytes), and occasional [[parafollicular cell]]s that surround a [[follicular lumen|lumen]] containing [[colloid]]. The thyroid gland secretes three hormones: the two [[thyroid hormones]] \u2013 [[triiodothyronine|triiodothyronine ( T<sub>3</sub>)]], and [[thyroid hormone|thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>)]], and a [[peptide hormone]],  [[calcitonin]]. The thyroid hormones influence the [[basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] and [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], and in children, growth and development. [[Calcitonin]] plays a role in [[Calcium metabolism#Regulation of calcium metabolism|calcium homeostasis]].{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|p=907}} Secretion of the two thyroid hormones is regulated by [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), which is secreted from the [[anterior pituitary]] gland.

During migration, the thyroid remains connected to the tongue by a narrow canal, the [[thyroglossal duct]]. At the end of the fifth week the thyroglossal duct degenerates, and over the following two weeks the detached thyroid migrates to its final position.\n\nThyroid disorders include [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]], thyroid [[inflammation]] ([[thyroiditis]]), thyroid enlargement ([[goitre]]), [[thyroid nodule]]s, and [[thyroid cancer]]. Hyperthyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is the [[autoimmune disorder]] [[Graves' disease]]. Hypothyroidism is characterized by a deficient secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is [[iodine deficiency]].

This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.{{sfn|Greenspan's|2011|p=177}}\n\nTRH is secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure in order to stimulate [[thermogenesis]].{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|p=896}} In addition to being suppressed by the presence of thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by [[dopamine]], [[somatostatin]], and [[glucocorticoid]]s.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2215}}\n\n===Calcitonin===\n{{Main|Calcitonin}}\nThe thyroid gland also produces the hormone [[calcitonin]], which helps regulate blood [[calcium metabolism|calcium]] levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin in response to [[hypercalcemia|high blood calcium]]. Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of [[osteoclast]]s, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by [[osteoblast]]s, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into [[bone]]. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin seems far less essential than PTH, since calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid ([[thyroidectomy]]), but not the [[parathyroid gland]]s.{{sfn|Guyton & Hall|2011|pp=988\u20139}}\n\n== Gene and protein expression ==\n{{Further |Bioinformatics#Gene and protein expression}}\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells: 70% of these genes are expressed in thyroid cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/thyroid+gland|title=The human proteome in thyroid gland \u2013 The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uhl\u00e9n|first=Mathias|last2=Fagerberg|first2=Linn|last3=Hallstr\u00f6m|first3=Bj\u00f6rn M.|last4=Lindskog|first4=Cecilia|last5=Oksvold|first5=Per|last6=Mardinoglu|first6=Adil|last7=Sivertsson|first7=\u00c5sa|last8=Kampf|first8=Caroline|last9=Sj\u00f6stedt|first9=Evelina|date=2015-01-23|title=Tissue-based map of the human proteome|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6220|page=1260419|doi=10.1126/science.1260419|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25613900|url=}}</ref> Two-hundred fifty of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid, and about 20 genes are highly thyroid specific. In the follicular cells, the proteins synthesized by these genes direct thyroid hormone synthesis - [[thyroglobulin]], [[Thyroid peroxidase|TPO]], and [[Iodotyrosine deiodinase|IYD]]; while in the parafollicular c-cells, they direct calcitonin synthesis - [[Calcitonin|CALCA]], and [[Calcitonin gene-related peptide|CALCB]].\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n[[General practitioner]]s, [[family physician]]s, and [[internal medicine]] specialists play a role in  identifying and monitoring the treatment of thyroid disease. [[Endocrinologist]]s and [[thyroidologist]]s are thyroid specialists. Thyroid surgeons or [[otolaryngologists]] are responsible for the surgical management of thyroid disease.\n\n=== Functional disorders ===\n\n====Hyperthyroidism====\n\n{{Main|Hyperthyroidism}}\nExcessive production of the thyroid hormones is called [[hyperthyroidism]]. Causes include [[Graves' disease]], [[toxic multinodular goitre]], solitary [[thyroid adenoma]], inflammation, and a [[pituitary adenoma]] which secretes excess TSH. Another cause is excess iodine availability, either from excess ingestion, induced by the drug [[amiodarone]], or following [[iodinated contrast]] [[medical imaging|imaging]]. {{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=738}}\n\nHyperthyroidism often causes a variety of [[symptoms#Types|non-specific symptoms]] including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, [[palpitation]]s, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause [[angina|chest pain]], [[diarrhoea]], hair loss and muscle weakness.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=740}} Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as [[beta blocker]]s.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=739}}\n\nLong-term management of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as [[propylthiouracil]], [[carbimazole]] and [[methimazole]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=745}} Alternatively, [[Isotopes of iodine#Radioiodines I-123, I-124, I-125, and I-131 in medicine and biology |radioactive iodine-131]] can be used to destroy thyroid tissue: radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by thyroid cells, which over time destroys them. The chosen [[First-line treatment|first-line treatment]] will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated.

If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered.

Sometimes no cause can be found, a state called \"simple goitre\".{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=750}}\n\nSome forms of goitre are associated with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=744}} Goitres may be associated with hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=744}} Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are [[Watchful waiting|simply monitored]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=744}}\n\n====Inflammation====\n{{Main|Thyroiditis}}\nInflammation of the thyroid is called [[thyroiditis]], and may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types of thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes followed by a period of hypothyroidism \u2013 Hashimoto's thyroiditis and [[postpartum thyroiditis]]. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include [[subacute thyroiditis]], [[acute thyroiditis]], [[silent thyroiditis]], [[Riedel's thyroiditis]] and traumatic injury, including [[palpation thyroiditis]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2237}}\n\n[[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] is an [[autoimmune disorder]] in which the thyroid gland is infiltrated by the [[lymphocyte]]s [[B-cell]] and [[T-cell]]s. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}} In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}} Hashimoto's is more common in females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}} Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], [[pernicious anaemia]], [[Addison's disease]] [[vitiligo]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}}\n\n[[Postpartum thyroiditis]] occurs in some females following [[childbirth]]. After delivery, the gland becomes inflamed and the condition initially presents with a period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and, usually, a return to normal function. {{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2238}} The course of the illness takes place over several months, and is characterised by a painless goitre. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase can be found on testing. The inflammation usually resolves without treatment, although thyroid hormone replacement may be needed during the period of hypothyroidism.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2238}}\n\n====Cancer====\n{{main|Thyroid cancer}}\nThe most common [[:wikt:neoplasm|neoplasm]] affecting the thyroid gland is a benign [[thyroid adenoma|adenoma]], usually presenting as a painless mass in the neck.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}} Malignant thyroid cancers are most often [[carcinoma]]s, although cancer can occur in any tissue that the thyroid consists of, including cancer of C-cells and lymphomas. Cancers from other sites also rarely lodge in the thyroid.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}} Radiation of the head and neck presents a [[risk factor]] for thyroid cancer, and cancer is more common in women than men, occurring at a rate of about 2:1.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}}\n\nIn most cases, thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in the neck. It is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=751}} Most malignant thyroid cancers are [[Papillary thyroid cancer|papillary]], followed by [[Follicular thyroid cancer|follicular]], [[Medullary thyroid cancer|medullary]], and [[thyroid lymphoma]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}}{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=751}} Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier in the course of disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo [[fine needle aspiration]]. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A [[radioactive iodine uptake test]] can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}}{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=752}}\n\nThyroid cancers are treated by [[thyroidectomy|removing the whole or part of thyroid gland]]. Radioactive [[Iodine 131]] may be given to [[Radiofrequency ablation|radioablate]] the thyroid. [[Thyroxine]] is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=752}} With the exception of the rare [[anaplastic thyroid cancer]], which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242,2246}}\n\n====Congenital====\nA [[persistent thyroglossal duct]] is the most common clinically significant [[congenital disorder]] of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form [[thyroglossal cysts]].<ref name=\"LANGMAN\" /> Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berbel P, Navarro D, Aus\u00f3 E, Varea E, Rodr\u00edguez AE, Ballesta JJ, Salinas M, Flores E, Faura CC |display-authors=etal | year = 2010 | title = Role of late maternal thyroid hormones in cerebral cortex development: an experimental model for human prematurity | url = http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/6/1462 | journal = Cereb Cortex | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 1462\u201375 | pmid = 19812240 | doi=10.1093/cercor/bhp212 | pmc=2871377}}</ref> In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have [[newborn screening]] programs at birth.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=B\u00fcy\u00fckgebiz|first1=Atilla|title=Newborn Screening for Congenital Hypothyroidism|journal=Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology|date=15 November 2012|volume=4|issue=4|pages=8\u201312|doi=10.4274/Jcrpe.845|pmid=23154158|pmc=3608007}}</ref>\n\nInfants with thyroid hormone deficiency ([[congenital hypothyroidism]]) can manifest problems of physical growth and development as well as brain development, termed [[cretinism]].{{sfn|Greenspan's|2011|p=164}}<ref name=\":1\" /> Children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with [[levothyroxine]], which facilitates normal growth and development.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=American Academy of Pediatrics|last2=Rose|first2=Susan R.|author3=American Thyroid Association|last4=Brown|first4=Rosalind S.|author5=Public Health Committee|author6=Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society|date=2006|title=Update of Newborn Screening and Therapy for Congenital Hypothyroidism|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=117|issue=6|pages=2290\u20132303|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0915|issn=0031-4005|pmid=16740880|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nMucinous, clear secretions may collect within these cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3&nbsp;cm in diameter.

In most tetrapod species, there are two paired thyroid glands \u2013 that is, the right and left lobes are not joined together. However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most [[mammal]]s, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.<ref name=VB/>\n\nIn larval [[lamprey]]s, the thyroid originates as an [[exocrine gland]], secreting its hormones into the gut, and associated with the larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the [[tunicate]]s and ''[[Amphioxus]]'', have a structure very similar to that of larval lampreys (the [[endostyle]]), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds, though not thyroxine.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThyroxine is critical to [[metabolic regulation]], and growth throughout the animal kingdom. Iodine and T4 trigger the [[metamorphosis|change]] from a plant-eating water-dwelling [[tadpole]] into a meat-eating land-dwelling [[frog]], with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the [[neotenic]] amphibian [[salamanders]], which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic [[axolotl]]. Among [[amphibian]]s, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as [[propylthiouracil]] (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of [[apoptosis]] on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely played a crucial role in the [[evolution]] of the human brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology|volume=5 |pages=155\u2013162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Human Evolution-|volume= 29 |issue= 1\u20133|pages=185\u2013205|year=2014|issn=0393-9375}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Desiccated thyroid]]\n* [[Thyroid disease in pregnancy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Books===\n* Monte A.

Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of [[osteoclast]]s, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by [[osteoblast]]s, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into [[bone]]. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands.

Sometimes no cause can be found, a state called \"simple goitre\".{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=750}}\n\nSome forms of goitre are associated with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=744}} Goitres may be associated with hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=744}} Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are [[Watchful waiting|simply monitored]].{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=744}}\n\n====Inflammation====\n{{Main|Thyroiditis}}\nInflammation of the thyroid is called [[thyroiditis]], and may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types of thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes followed by a period of hypothyroidism \u2013 Hashimoto's thyroiditis and [[postpartum thyroiditis]]. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include [[subacute thyroiditis]], [[acute thyroiditis]], [[silent thyroiditis]], [[Riedel's thyroiditis]] and traumatic injury, including [[palpation thyroiditis]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2237}}\n\n[[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] is an [[autoimmune disorder]] in which the thyroid gland is infiltrated by the [[lymphocyte]]s [[B-cell]] and [[T-cell]]s. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}} In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}} Hashimoto's is more common in females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}} Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]], [[pernicious anaemia]], [[Addison's disease]] [[vitiligo]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2230}}\n\n[[Postpartum thyroiditis]] occurs in some females following [[childbirth]]. After delivery, the gland becomes inflamed and the condition initially presents with a period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and, usually, a return to normal function. {{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2238}} The course of the illness takes place over several months, and is characterised by a painless goitre. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase can be found on testing. The inflammation usually resolves without treatment, although thyroid hormone replacement may be needed during the period of hypothyroidism.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|pp=2238}}\n\n====Cancer====\n{{main|Thyroid cancer}}\nThe most common [[:wikt:neoplasm|neoplasm]] affecting the thyroid gland is a benign [[thyroid adenoma|adenoma]], usually presenting as a painless mass in the neck.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}} Malignant thyroid cancers are most often [[carcinoma]]s, although cancer can occur in any tissue that the thyroid consists of, including cancer of C-cells and lymphomas. Cancers from other sites also rarely lodge in the thyroid.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}} Radiation of the head and neck presents a [[risk factor]] for thyroid cancer, and cancer is more common in women than men, occurring at a rate of about 2:1.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}}\n\nIn most cases, thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in the neck. It is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=751}} Most malignant thyroid cancers are [[Papillary thyroid cancer|papillary]], followed by [[Follicular thyroid cancer|follicular]], [[Medullary thyroid cancer|medullary]], and [[thyroid lymphoma]].{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}}{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=751}} Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier in the course of disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo [[fine needle aspiration]]. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A [[radioactive iodine uptake test]] can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242}}{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=752}}\n\nThyroid cancers are treated by [[thyroidectomy|removing the whole or part of thyroid gland]]. Radioactive [[Iodine 131]] may be given to [[Radiofrequency ablation|radioablate]] the thyroid. [[Thyroxine]] is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence.{{sfn|Davidson's|2010|p=752}} With the exception of the rare [[anaplastic thyroid cancer]], which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.{{sfn|Harrison's|2011|p=2242,2246}}\n\n====Congenital====\nA [[persistent thyroglossal duct]] is the most common clinically significant [[congenital disorder]] of the thyroid gland.

In fish, it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into distinct lobes. However, in some [[teleost]]s, patches of thyroid tissue are found elsewhere in the body, associated with the kidneys, spleen, heart, or eyes.<ref name=VB>{{Cite book|author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 555\u2013556|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}</ref>\n\nIn [[tetrapod]]s, the thyroid is always found somewhere in the neck region. In most tetrapod species, there are two paired thyroid glands \u2013 that is, the right and left lobes are not joined together. However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most [[mammal]]s, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.<ref name=VB/>\n\nIn larval [[lamprey]]s, the thyroid originates as an [[exocrine gland]], secreting its hormones into the gut, and associated with the larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the [[tunicate]]s and ''[[Amphioxus]]'', have a structure very similar to that of larval lampreys (the [[endostyle]]), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds, though not thyroxine.<ref name=VB/>\n\nThyroxine is critical to [[metabolic regulation]], and growth throughout the animal kingdom. Iodine and T4 trigger the [[metamorphosis|change]] from a plant-eating water-dwelling [[tadpole]] into a meat-eating land-dwelling [[frog]], with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the [[neotenic]] amphibian [[salamanders]], which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic [[axolotl]]. Among [[amphibian]]s, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as [[propylthiouracil]] (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of [[apoptosis]] on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely played a crucial role in the [[evolution]] of the human brain.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology|volume=5 |pages=155\u2013162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Human Evolution-|volume= 29 |issue= 1\u20133|pages=185\u2013205|year=2014|issn=0393-9375}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Desiccated thyroid]]\n* [[Thyroid disease in pregnancy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Books===\n* Monte A.

The villages had ceramic vessels and wood, bone, antler, stone and flint tools as well as textiles.  Copper ax blades and knives provide the first evidence of metal use in Switzerland.  Imported mollusks show that there were trade connections to the Mediterranean.  The bones at Egolzwil 3 are over two thirds from domestic animals with the remainder from wild animals.  The main domesticated animals were sheep, goats and pigs with only a few domestic cattle.  The animals hunted included deer, roe deer, wild boar and elk.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]] the canton was quite settled.  There were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Sempach and Lake Baldegg along with hilltop settlements, graves and scattered items throughout the area.  At Hochdorf-Baldegg a fenced village from the early Bronze Age (2200\u20131500 BC) was uncovered.  The single-story houses all had clay or stone hearths.  During the Middle Bronze Age (1550\u20131350 BC) most of the villages were not located directly on the lake shores.  The Late Bronze Age settlement at Sursee-Zellmoos on Lake Sempach featured houses arranged in rows with mortared stone.  The walls were timber lined with clay.  Another Late Bronze Age settlement near the village of Sch\u00f6tz was densely populated between 1350 and 800 BC.\n\nWhile numerous individual [[Iron Age]] items have been found, almost no settlements have been discovered.  From the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] (800\u2013480 BC) mainly graves have been discovered.  Very little is known about the [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne period]] (480\u201330 BC) in Lucerne.  Some iron tools, gold coins, ceramic vessels and a glass bangle as well as a burial ground with at least four graves have been found.\n\nDuring the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]], the canton was once again thickly settled.  A number of farms were built in the north-south running valleys ([[Wigger (river)|Wigger]], [[Suhre]], [[Wynental|Wyna]] and See valleys).  During the 1st century AD, the farms provided food for the [[Roman legion|Legion]] camp in [[Vindonissa]] and for the larger settlements located in the Swiss plateau.\n\nTowards the end of the 1st century there was a [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]] at [[Sursee]].  The remains of houses show that there were a number of small shops and manufacturing buildings in the town.  The west bank of the Suhre was fortified with a stone slip and may have served as a ship or raft berth.  Imports from various regions of the Roman Empire (southern Spain, southern Italy, Lipari, southern and eastern Gaul and the Germanic areas) provide evidence of extensive trade relations.  Sursee was likely a freight hub for trade with the entire Alpine region.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===Early middle ages===\n[[File:Picswiss LU-20-40.jpg|thumb|Ruins of an early medieval church at Sursee]]\nFollowing the collapse of the Roman Empire, the canton of Lucerne was settled by the [[Alamanni]], who generally settled away from the Roman settlements.  Some exceptions include a Roman manor at [[B\u00fcron]] and the Roman town of Sursee.  An [[Alamannic graves#Alemannic grave fields|Alamannic grave field]] was found at [[Aesch, Lucerne|Aesch]] with 61 graves with wooden coffins from before the 7th century before.  In the women's graves there were necklaces with glass and amber beads, while swords were found in the men's graves.  Belt buckles and small iron knives were found in the graves of both sexes.  A few items from the southern Alpine region, southern Germany and Burgundy indicate that trade continued.\n\nTwo early medieval stone grave vaults, both of which were used for multiple burials, were found in the church of [[Altishofen]].  In the treasury of [[Berom\u00fcnster]] Abbey there is a 7th-century ornate [[reliquary]] of gilded copper plates, which probably came from northern Italy.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===Foundation of Lucerne city===\nLucerne grew up around a Benedictine monastery, founded about 750 on the right bank of the Reuss by [[Murbach Abbey]] in Alsace, of which it long remained a \"cell\". It is first mentioned in a charter of 840 under the name of ''Luciaria'', which is probably derived from the patron saint of the monastery, St [[Leodegar]].  The name ''Lucerrun'' is first mentioned in 1252. At some point, a small village grew up around the monastery. The first signs of a municipal constitution appear in 1252.\n\nWith the growing power of the [[Habsburg]]s in the area the ties that bound Lucerne to Murbach weakened. In 1291 the Habsburgs finally purchased Lucerne from Murbach.  The purchase of Lucerne by the Habsburgs drove the three forest cantons ([[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] and [[Unterwalden]]) to form an [[Federal Charter of 1291|Eternal Alliance]], an act that is considered to be the foundation of Switzerland.  In 1332 Lucerne became the fourth member of the ''[[Eidgenossen]]'' or [[Old Swiss Confederation|Swiss Confederation]], and the first town to join the rural forest cantons.\n\n[[File:Sempach Schlachtfresko.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Sempach solidified Lucerne's place in the Swiss Confederation]]\n[[File:Amstaldenhandel.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Amstaldenhandel'', an event in the history of the canton of Lucerne, Switzerland]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Sempach]] (1386) near Sempach (which while allied wouldn't become part of the canton for 8 more years) drove the Habsburgs out of the region and strengthened the Confederation. That victory led also to the gradual acquisition of territory ruled by and from the town.\n\nAmstalden, a wealthy innkeeper [[Sch\u00fcpfheim]] in the Entlebuch valley of the canton of Lucerne, was the leader of a planned rebellion of the valley against the city of Lucerne. In a plot to limit the power of the city, officials from the neighbouring [[canton of Obwalden]] had promised their support. The conspiracy was detected before they could stage the planned coup. On 24 August 1478, Amstalden was arrested, tortured and interrogated, and finally beheaded in November 1478.\n\nThe incident furthered the distrust amongst rural and urban cantons in the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and was one of the reasons for the conclusion of the [[Stanser Verkommnis]] (Treaty of [[Stans]]) in 1481, an important coalition treaty of the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] Lucerne remained attached to Roman Catholicism, of which ever since it has been the great stronghold in Switzerland. The [[papal nuncio]] resided here from 1601 to 1873. In the 16th century, during the [[Early Modern Switzerland|early modern age]], the town government fell into the hands of an aristocratic [[oligarchy]], whose power, though shaken by the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]] in the Entlebuch, lasted until 1798. Under the [[Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars#Other campaigns|French]]-supported [[Helvetic republic]] (1798\u20131803) Lucerne was the seat of the central government. When the republic collapsed, under the [[Act of Mediation]] (1803) it was one of the six \"[[Directorial system|Directorial]]\" cantons and during the [[Restauration (Switzerland)|Restoration]] (from 1815 to 1848) it was one of the three ruling cantons.\n\nThe [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] government was swept away by the cantonal constitution of 1831. But in 1841 the Conservatives regained power.  They quickly recalled the [[Jesuit]]s, who had been expelled by earlier radical governments, to head the cantonal school system.  The riots that followed brought about the [[Sonderbund War]] (1847) in which the Conservatives were defeated, the decisive battle taking place at Gisikon, not far from Lucerne.<ref name=\"EB city\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Lucerne (City) | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | volume = 17 | pages = 97 | year = 1911 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N1YEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97#PPA97,M1 | accessdate = 2009-04-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe canton of Lucerne is part of [[Central Switzerland]].

[[Rigi]] from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] or about 30,000 BC.  Other animal bones including mammoth, reindeer and giant deer from the [[Ice age|local glacial maximum]] have also been found in the canton.  Around 17,000 BC the glaciers disappeared from the [[Swiss plateau]] and recolonization is likely at that time.\n\nThe first [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] settlement discovered in the canton is in the Wauwilermoos, which is now a Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.html |title=KGS-Inventar |year=2009 |work=KGS Inventar |publisher=Federal Office of Civil Protection |language=German |accessdate=12 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628110559/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>  A number of other settlements have since been found, mainly on sandy, dry elevations in the immediate vicinity of water.  The settlements of [[Wauwilermoos pile dwelling settlement (Egolzwil 3)|Egolzwil 3]] in Wauwilermoos in [[Egolzwil]], Seematte at [[Hitzkirch]] and Halbinsel in [[Sursee]] are part of the [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]] a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]].<ref name=UNESCO>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/ UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]</ref>\n\nThe Wauwilermoos houses had wooden or bark floors and hearths of clay.  The villages had ceramic vessels and wood, bone, antler, stone and flint tools as well as textiles.  Copper ax blades and knives provide the first evidence of metal use in Switzerland.  Imported mollusks show that there were trade connections to the Mediterranean.  The bones at Egolzwil 3 are over two thirds from domestic animals with the remainder from wild animals.  The main domesticated animals were sheep, goats and pigs with only a few domestic cattle.  The animals hunted included deer, roe deer, wild boar and elk.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]] the canton was quite settled.  There were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Sempach and Lake Baldegg along with hilltop settlements, graves and scattered items throughout the area.  At Hochdorf-Baldegg a fenced village from the early Bronze Age (2200\u20131500 BC) was uncovered.  The single-story houses all had clay or stone hearths.  During the Middle Bronze Age (1550\u20131350 BC) most of the villages were not located directly on the lake shores.  The Late Bronze Age settlement at Sursee-Zellmoos on Lake Sempach featured houses arranged in rows with mortared stone.  The walls were timber lined with clay.  Another Late Bronze Age settlement near the village of Sch\u00f6tz was densely populated between 1350 and 800 BC.\n\nWhile numerous individual [[Iron Age]] items have been found, almost no settlements have been discovered.  From the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] (800\u2013480 BC) mainly graves have been discovered.  Very little is known about the [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne period]] (480\u201330 BC) in Lucerne.  Some iron tools, gold coins, ceramic vessels and a glass bangle as well as a burial ground with at least four graves have been found.\n\nDuring the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]], the canton was once again thickly settled.  A number of farms were built in the north-south running valleys ([[Wigger (river)|Wigger]], [[Suhre]], [[Wynental|Wyna]] and See valleys).  During the 1st century AD, the farms provided food for the [[Roman legion|Legion]] camp in [[Vindonissa]] and for the larger settlements located in the Swiss plateau.\n\nTowards the end of the 1st century there was a [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]] at [[Sursee]].  The remains of houses show that there were a number of small shops and manufacturing buildings in the town.  The west bank of the Suhre was fortified with a stone slip and may have served as a ship or raft berth.  Imports from various regions of the Roman Empire (southern Spain, southern Italy, Lipari, southern and eastern Gaul and the Germanic areas) provide evidence of extensive trade relations.  Sursee was likely a freight hub for trade with the entire Alpine region.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===Early middle ages===\n[[File:Picswiss LU-20-40.jpg|thumb|Ruins of an early medieval church at Sursee]]\nFollowing the collapse of the Roman Empire, the canton of Lucerne was settled by the [[Alamanni]], who generally settled away from the Roman settlements.  Some exceptions include a Roman manor at [[B\u00fcron]] and the Roman town of Sursee.  An [[Alamannic graves#Alemannic grave fields|Alamannic grave field]] was found at [[Aesch, Lucerne|Aesch]] with 61 graves with wooden coffins from before the 7th century before.  In the women's graves there were necklaces with glass and amber beads, while swords were found in the men's graves.  Belt buckles and small iron knives were found in the graves of both sexes.  A few items from the southern Alpine region, southern Germany and Burgundy indicate that trade continued.\n\nTwo early medieval stone grave vaults, both of which were used for multiple burials, were found in the church of [[Altishofen]].  In the treasury of [[Berom\u00fcnster]] Abbey there is a 7th-century ornate [[reliquary]] of gilded copper plates, which probably came from northern Italy.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===Foundation of Lucerne city===\nLucerne grew up around a Benedictine monastery, founded about 750 on the right bank of the Reuss by [[Murbach Abbey]] in Alsace, of which it long remained a \"cell\". It is first mentioned in a charter of 840 under the name of ''Luciaria'', which is probably derived from the patron saint of the monastery, St [[Leodegar]].  The name ''Lucerrun'' is first mentioned in 1252. At some point, a small village grew up around the monastery. The first signs of a municipal constitution appear in 1252.\n\nWith the growing power of the [[Habsburg]]s in the area the ties that bound Lucerne to Murbach weakened. In 1291 the Habsburgs finally purchased Lucerne from Murbach.  The purchase of Lucerne by the Habsburgs drove the three forest cantons ([[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]] and [[Unterwalden]]) to form an [[Federal Charter of 1291|Eternal Alliance]], an act that is considered to be the foundation of Switzerland.  In 1332 Lucerne became the fourth member of the ''[[Eidgenossen]]'' or [[Old Swiss Confederation|Swiss Confederation]], and the first town to join the rural forest cantons.\n\n[[File:Sempach Schlachtfresko.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Sempach solidified Lucerne's place in the Swiss Confederation]]\n[[File:Amstaldenhandel.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Amstaldenhandel'', an event in the history of the canton of Lucerne, Switzerland]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Sempach]] (1386) near Sempach (which while allied wouldn't become part of the canton for 8 more years) drove the Habsburgs out of the region and strengthened the Confederation. That victory led also to the gradual acquisition of territory ruled by and from the town.\n\nAmstalden, a wealthy innkeeper [[Sch\u00fcpfheim]] in the Entlebuch valley of the canton of Lucerne, was the leader of a planned rebellion of the valley against the city of Lucerne. In a plot to limit the power of the city, officials from the neighbouring [[canton of Obwalden]] had promised their support. The conspiracy was detected before they could stage the planned coup. On 24 August 1478, Amstalden was arrested, tortured and interrogated, and finally beheaded in November 1478.\n\nThe incident furthered the distrust amongst rural and urban cantons in the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and was one of the reasons for the conclusion of the [[Stanser Verkommnis]] (Treaty of [[Stans]]) in 1481, an important coalition treaty of the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] Lucerne remained attached to Roman Catholicism, of which ever since it has been the great stronghold in Switzerland. The [[papal nuncio]] resided here from 1601 to 1873. In the 16th century, during the [[Early Modern Switzerland|early modern age]], the town government fell into the hands of an aristocratic [[oligarchy]], whose power, though shaken by the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]] in the Entlebuch, lasted until 1798. Under the [[Campaigns of 1798 in the French Revolutionary Wars#Other campaigns|French]]-supported [[Helvetic republic]] (1798\u20131803) Lucerne was the seat of the central government. When the republic collapsed, under the [[Act of Mediation]] (1803) it was one of the six \"[[Directorial system|Directorial]]\" cantons and during the [[Restauration (Switzerland)|Restoration]] (from 1815 to 1848) it was one of the three ruling cantons.\n\nThe [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] government was swept away by the cantonal constitution of 1831. But in 1841 the Conservatives regained power.  They quickly recalled the [[Jesuit]]s, who had been expelled by earlier radical governments, to head the cantonal school system.  The riots that followed brought about the [[Sonderbund War]] (1847) in which the Conservatives were defeated, the decisive battle taking place at Gisikon, not far from Lucerne.<ref name=\"EB city\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Lucerne (City) | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | volume = 17 | pages = 97 | year = 1911 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N1YEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97#PPA97,M1 | accessdate = 2009-04-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe canton of Lucerne is part of [[Central Switzerland]].

In 1998, the award was split into two categories, '''Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Daytime Television Program''' and '''Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Primetime or Late Night Television Program''', but was eventually combined into one category again. In 2008, the award received an offshoot category, the '''Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production for Children'''.

Many craters and other depressions on Mars show deltas that resemble those on Earth. In addition, if a lake lies in a depression, channels entering it will all stop at the same altitude. Such an arrangement is visible around places on Mars that are supposed to have contained large bodies of water, including around a [[Mars ocean hypothesis|possible ocean]] in the north.\n\nLake formation in the past has been suspected by various researchers for quite some time.<ref>De Hon, R. 1992.

All craters were located in the northern hemisphere of Mars.  These craters had  floors lying roughly 4000 m below Martian 'sea level' (a level that, given the planet's lack of seas, is defined based on elevation and atmospheric pressure).  Features on the floors of these craters could only have formed in the presence of water. Many craters contain multiple features showing that the water level in the craters rose and fell over time.  Deltas and terraces were present in some craters.<ref>http://astrobiology.com/2019/02/first-evidence-of-a-planet-wide-groundwater-system-on-mars.html</ref>  Minerals such as various clays and light-toned minerals that form in water are found on some of the crater floors.

These craters had  floors lying roughly 4000 m below Martian 'sea level' (a level that, given the planet's lack of seas, is defined based on elevation and atmospheric pressure).  Features on the floors of these craters could only have formed in the presence of water. Many craters contain multiple features showing that the water level in the craters rose and fell over time.

Energy from the impact melted the ice and formed a giant lake that eventually sent water to the North. The lake's volume was equal to that of Earth's [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The deepest part of the lake may have taken more than a hundred thousand years to freeze, but with the help of heat from the impact, geothermal heating, and dissolved solutes it may have had liquid water for many millions of years. Life may have developed in this time. This region shows a great deal of evidence of glacial activity with flow features, crevasse-like fractures, [[drumline]]s, [[esker]]s, [[tarns]], [[aretes]], [[cirques]], [[Glacial horn|horns]], U-shaped valleys, and terraces.

Nevertheless, by 1948 it remained apparent that there were gaps in the [[social structure]], whether legislated or otherwise, concerning the rights and opportunities of nonwhites. The rapid [[economic development]] of [[World War II]] attracted black migrant workers in large numbers to chief industrial centres, where they compensated for the wartime shortage of white labour. However, this escalated rate of black urbanisation went unrecognised by the South African government, which failed to accommodate the influx with parallel expansion in housing or [[social services]].<ref name=\"zastudy\" /> Overcrowding, spiking [[Crime statistics|crime rates]], and disillusionment resulted; urban blacks came to support a new generation of leaders influenced by the principles of self-determination and popular freedoms enshrined in such statements as the [[Atlantic Charter]]. Whites reacted negatively to the changes, allowing the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] (or simply the National Party) to convince a large segment of the [[voting bloc]] that the impotence of the United Party in curtailing the evolving position of nonwhites indicated that the organisation had fallen under the influence of Western liberals.<ref name=\"zastudy\" /> Many [[Afrikaners]], white South Africans chiefly of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent but with early infusions of [[Germans]] and [[Huguenot|French Huguenots]] who were soon assimilated, also resented what they perceived as disempowerment by an underpaid black workforce and the superior economic power and prosperity of white [[English language|English]] speakers.<ref>P.

A second faction were the \"purists\", who believed in \"vertical segregation\", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term.

Such groups were split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and [[Afrikaans]] language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups.\n\nThe state passed laws that paved the way for \"grand apartheid\", which was centred on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race. This strategy was in part adopted from \"left-over\" British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the [[Boer republics]] in the [[Anglo-Boer war]]. This created the black-only \"[[township]]s\" or \"locations\", where blacks were relocated to their own towns. In addition, \"petty apartheid\" laws were passed. The principal apartheid laws were as follows.<ref name=\"b\">Alistair Boddy-Evans.

The [[Suppression of Communism Act]] of 1950 banned any party subscribing to [[Communism]].  The act defined Communism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposed [[Public policy|government policy]] risked being labelled as a Communist.  Since the law specifically stated that Communism aimed to disrupt racial harmony, it was frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings were banned, as were certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government.\n\nThe [[Bantu Authorities Act, 1951|Bantu Authorities Act of 1951]] created separate government structures for blacks and whites and was the first piece of legislation to support the government's plan of separate development in the [[bantustan]]s. The [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Black Self-Government Act]] of 1959 entrenched the NP policy of nominally independent \"[[homeland]]s\" for blacks. So-called \"self\u2013governing Bantu units\" were proposed, which would have devolved administrative powers, with the promise later of [[autonomy]] and [[self-government]].  It also abolished the seats of white representatives of black South Africans and removed from the rolls the few blacks still qualified to vote. The [[Bantu Investment Corporation Act]] of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands to create employment there. Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in \"white\" cities and redirect such development to the \"homelands\". The [[Black Homeland Citizenship Act]] of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy. It changed the status of blacks to citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The aim was to ensure a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans achieve full independence.\n\nInterracial contact in sport was frowned upon, but there were no segregatory sports laws.\n\nThe government tightened pass laws compelling blacks to carry [[identity document]]s, to prevent the immigration of blacks from other countries. To reside in a city, blacks had to be in employment there. Until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these ''pass'' requirements, as attempts to introduce ''pass laws'' for women were met with fierce resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/un/womenrole.html |title=Extracts from paper prepared by the Secretariat for the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, Copenhagen, July 1980 (The anti-pass campaign) |accessdate=14 July 2008 |publisher=[[African National Congress]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622003552/http://www.anc.org.za/un/womenrole.html |archivedate=22 June 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Disenfranchisement of Coloured voters ===\n{{Main|Coloured vote constitutional crisis}}\n[[File:Cape-coloured-children.jpg|thumb|Cape Coloured children in [[Bonteheuwel]]]]\n[[File:Annual per capita personal income by race group in South Africa relative to white levels.svg|lang=en|thumb|Annual per capita personal income by race group in [[South Africa]] relative to white levels.]]\n\nIn 1950, D.

Once South Africa became a republic, Prime Minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] called for improved relations and greater accord between people of British descent and the Afrikaners.<ref>[[Doug Booth|Booth, Douglas]] (1998). ''The race game: sport and politics in South Africa.'' Routledge. p. 89.</ref>  He claimed that the only difference was between those in favour of apartheid and those against it. The ethnic division would no longer be between Afrikaans and English speakers, but between blacks and whites.\n\nMost Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety. White voters of British descent were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority \"no\" vote in [[Natal Province|Natal]].<ref>Thompson, Paul Singer (1990). ''Natalians first: separatism in South Africa, 1909\u20131961.'' Southern Book Publishers. p. 167.</ref> Later, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which concerned them. British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan|Harold Macmillan's]] \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech left the British faction feeling that the United Kingdom had abandoned them.<ref>Joyce, Peter (2007).

''A history of South Africa.'' Cassell. p. 311.</ref> indicating that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population.\n\n== Homeland system ==\n{{Main|Bantustan}}\n[[File:South_Africa_%26_South_West_Africa_Bantustans_Map.svg|right|thumb|400px|Map of the 20 bantustans in South Africa and South West Africa.]]\n\nUnder the homeland system, the government attempted to divide South Africa and South West Africa into a number of separate states, each of which was supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for a different ethnic group.<ref name=autogenerated1>p. 15</ref>\n\nTerritorial separation was hardly a new institution. There were, for example, the \"reserves\" created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, 13 percent of the land was reserved for black homelands, a small amount relative to its total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 justified apartheid and the homeland system, but stated that additional land ought to be given to the homelands, a recommendation that was not carried out.<ref>Evans, Ivan. Bureaucracy and Race: Native Administration in South Africa. Berkeley: U of California, 1997. N. pag. Print.</ref>\n\nWhen Verwoerd became Prime Minister in 1958, the policy of \"separate development\" came into being, with the homeland structure as one of its cornerstones. Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of independence to these homelands. The government justified its plans on the ostensible basis that \"(the) government's policy is, therefore, not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood, of different nations, granting to each self-determination within the borders of their homelands{{snds}}hence this policy of separate development\".<ref>Amisi, Baruti, and Simphiwe Nojiyeza. Access to Decent Sanitation in South Africa: The Challenges of Eradicating the Bucket System Baruti Amisi n. pag. Feb. 2008. Web.</ref> Under the homelands system, blacks would no longer be citizens of South Africa, becoming citizens of the independent homelands who worked in South Africa as foreign migrant labourers on temporary work permits. In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act was passed, and border industries and the [[Bantu Investment Corporation Act, 1959|Bantu Investment Corporation]] were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in or near the homelands. Many black South Africans who had never resided in their identified homeland were forcibly removed from the cities to the homelands.\n\nThe vision of a South Africa divided into multiple [[ethno-state]]s appealed to the reform-minded Afrikaner intelligensia, and it provided a more coherent philosophical and moral framework for the National Party's policies, while also providing a veneer of intellectual respectability to the controversial policy of so-called [[baasskap]].<ref name=\"sparksNews24Appalled\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/AllisterSparks/Verwoerd-and-his-policies-appalled-me-20150512|title=Verwoerd and his policies appalled me|work=News24|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"politicsWebRememberingVerwoerd\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/remembering-verwoerd|title=Remembering Verwoerd - OPINION {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"afrikanerDominationNews24\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afrikaner-domination-died-with-verwoerd-50-years-ago-20160906|title=Afrikaner domination died with Verwoerd 50 years ago|work=News24|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n[[File:Ciskei2.jpg|thumb|left|Rural area in [[Ciskei]], one the four nominally independent homelands.]]\n\nIn total, 20 homelands were allocated to an ethnic groups, ten in South Africa proper and ten in South West Africa. Of these 20 homelands, 19 were classified as black, while one, [[Basterland]], was set aside for a sub-group of Coloureds known as [[Basters]], who are closely related to Afrikaners. Four of the homelands were declared independent by the South African government: [[Transkei]] in 1976, [[Bophuthatswana]] in 1977, [[Venda]] in 1979, and [[Ciskei]] in 1981 (known as the TBVC states). Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence, its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked and replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African.<ref name=\"travel\">Those who had the money to travel or emigrate were not given full passports; instead, travel documents were issued.</ref> The [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black citizens of the homelands and the problems which other countries faced through entry of [[illegal immigrants]].\n\n=== International recognition of the Bantustans ===\nBantustans within the borders of South Africa and South West Africa were classified by degree of nominal self-rule: 6 were \"non-self-governing\", 10 were \"self-governing\", and 4 were \"independent\". In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no significant economic infrastructure and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.\n\nThroughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the Swiss-South African Association encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a United States House of Representatives resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.<ref>http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf</ref> Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.\n\n=== Forced removals {{Anchor|Forced removal}} ===\n{{See also|1=Group Areas Act|2=Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991}}\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of \"resettlement\", to force people to move to their designated \"group areas\". Millions of people were forced to relocate. These removals included people relocated due to [[slum clearance]] programmes, labour tenants on white-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called \"black spots\" (black-owned land surrounded by white farms), the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and \"surplus people\" from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a \"Coloured Labour Preference Area\")<ref name=\"clp\">{{cite journal | last = Western | first = J. | title = A divided city: Cape Town | journal = [[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]] | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 711\u2013716 | doi = 10.1016/S0962-6298(02)00016-1 | date = June 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref> who were moved to the [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]] homelands.

Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police forced residents out of their homes and loaded their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land {{convert|19|km}} from the [[city centre]], known as [[Meadowlands, Gauteng|Meadowlands]], which the government had purchased in 1953. Meadowlands became part of a new [[Planned community|planned black city]] called [[Soweto]]. Sophiatown was destroyed by [[bulldozer]]s, and a new white suburb named [[Triomf]] (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to black South Africans alone. Forced removals from areas like [[Cato Manor]] (Mkhumbane) in [[Durban]], and [[District Six]] in [[Cape Town]], where 55,000 Coloured and [[Indian South Africans|Indian people]] were forced to move to new townships on the [[Cape Flats]], were carried out under the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950.

Only blacks with \"Section 10\" rights (those who had migrated to the cities before World War II) were excluded from this provision. A pass was issued only to a black with approved work. Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands. A pass was issued for one magisterial district (usually one town) confining the holder to that area only. Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant. This was often followed by deportation to the person's [[Bantustan|homeland]] and prosecution of the employer for employing an illegal migrant.

[[Trade unions in South Africa|Trade unions]] under apartheid were racially segregated, with 54 unions being white only, 38 for Indian and Coloured and 19 for black people. The Industrial Conciliation Act (1956) legislated against the creation of multi-racial trade unions and attempted to split existing multi-racial unions into separate branches or organisations along racial lines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Omond|first=Roger|title=The Apartheid Handbook|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=978-0-14-022749-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/apartheidhandboo0000omon_z0a2/page/102 102\u2013109]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/apartheidhandboo0000omon_z0a2/page/102}}</ref>\n\nEach black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems. Blacks were not allowed to buy [[hard liquor]]. They were able only to buy state-produced poor quality beer (although this law was relaxed later). Public beaches, swimming pools, some [[Pedestrian separation structure|pedestrian bridges]], [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinema]] parking spaces, [[Cemetery|graveyards]], parks, and [[public toilet]]s were segregated. Cinemas and theatres in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks. There were practically no cinemas in black areas. Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff. Blacks were prohibited from attending white churches under the Churches Native Laws Amendment Act of 1957, but this was never rigidly enforced and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law. Blacks earning 360 [[South African rand|rand]] a year or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high, at 750 rand a year. On the other hand, the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nBlacks could never acquire land in white areas. In the homelands, much of the land belonged to a \"tribe\", where the local chieftain would decide how the land had to be used. This resulted in whites owning almost all the industrial and agricultural lands and much of the prized residential land. Most blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship when the \"homelands\" became \"independent\", and they were no longer able to apply for [[South African passport]]s. Eligibility requirements for a passport had been difficult for blacks to meet, the government contending that a passport was a privilege, not a right, and the government did not grant many passports to blacks. Apartheid pervaded culture as well as the law, and was entrenched by most of the [[Media of South Africa|mainstream media]].\n\n=== Coloured classification ===\n{{Discrimination sidebar}}\n{{Main|Coloureds}}\nThe population was classified into four groups: African, White, Indian and Coloured (capitalised to denote their legal definitions in [[Law of South Africa|South African law]]). The Coloured group included people regarded as being of mixed descent, including of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[Malay race|Malay]] ancestry. Many were descended from people brought to South Africa from other parts of the world, such as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and [[China]] as [[slavery|slaves]] and [[Indentured labour|indentured workers]].<ref name=\"Intro\">Patric Tariq Mellet [https://archive.is/20120707062952/http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/intro/ \"Intro\"], ''Cape Slavery Heritage''.

People of Indian ancestry were considered Coloured under this act. Appearance, social and acceptance and descent were used to determine the qualification of an individual into one of the three categories. A white person was described by the act as one whose parents were both white and possessed the \"habits, speech, education, deportment and demeanour\" of a white person. Blacks were defined by the act as belonging to an African race or tribe. Lastly, Coloureds were those who could not be classified as black or white.<ref name=\"SAHistoryOrg\">{{cite web |title=Apartheid Legislation 1850s - 1970s |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/apartheid-legislation-1850s-1970s |website=SAHistory.org |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria at the time that the Population Registration Act was implemented to determine who was Coloured. Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or White, or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or Black. The tests included the [[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]], in which a pencil was shoved into the subject's curly hair and the subject made to shake their head. If the pencil stuck the person was deemed to be Black; if dislodged the person was pronounced Coloured. Other tests involved examining the shapes of [[Mandible|jaw lines]] and [[buttocks]] and pinching people to see what language they would say \"Ouch\" in.<ref name=\"NewScientist1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Sue |title=Forum: Watching the 'race' detectives - The results of South Africa's race classification laws |journal=New Scientist |date=20 April 1991 |volume=1765 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13017656-200-forum-watching-the-race-detectives-the-results-of-south-africas-race-classification-laws/ |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref> As a result of these tests, different members of the same family found themselves in different race groups. Further tests determined membership of the various sub-racial groups of the Coloureds.\n\nDiscriminated against by apartheid, Coloureds were as a matter of state policy forced to live in separate [[Township (South Africa)|townships]], as defined in the Group Areas Act (1950),<ref name=\"GroupAreas1950\">{{cite web |title=Group Areas Act of 1950 |url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/group-areas-act-1950 |website=SAHistory.org.za |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref> in some cases leaving homes their families had occupied for generations, and received an inferior education, though better than that provided to Africans. They played an important role in the [[anti-apartheid movement]]: for example the [[African Political Organization]] established in 1902 had an exclusively Coloured membership.\n\nVoting rights were denied to Coloureds in the same way that they were denied to Blacks from 1950 to 1983. However, in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among Whites, and the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted [[Suffrage|voting rights]], but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands.<ref name=\"SAHistoryOrg\"/><ref name=\"GroupAreas1950\"/> These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] as a vehicle to try to prevent the co-option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with Whites. The battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans.\n\n=== Education ===\n[[Education in South Africa|Education]] was segregated by the 1953 [[Bantu Education Act]], which crafted a separate system of education for black South African students and was designed to prepare black people for lives as a labouring class.<ref name=\"byrnes\">{{cite book|last= Byrnes|first=Rita M.|title=South Africa: A Country Study|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|year=1996| location=Washington|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref> In 1959 separate universities were created for black, Coloured and Indian people.

Higher education was provided in separate universities and colleges after 1959. Eight black universities were created in the homelands. [[Fort Hare University]] in the [[Ciskei]] (now [[Eastern Cape]]) was to register only [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]-speaking students. [[Sesotho|Sotho]], [[Setswana|Tswana]], [[Sepedi|Pedi]] and [[Venda language|Venda]] speakers were placed at the newly founded [[University of Limpopo|University College of the North]] at Turfloop, while the [[University of Zululand|University College of Zululand]] was launched to serve [[Zulu people|Zulu]] students.

By 1981, under apartheid government, 11 new universities were built: 7 for Blacks, 1 for Coloreds, 1 for Indian, 1 for Afrikaans and 1 dual-language medium Afrikaans and English.\n\n=== Women under apartheid ===\n[[Colonialism]] and apartheid had a major impact on Black and Coloured women, since they suffered both racial and [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Women's Charter, 17 April 1954 Johannesburg |url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4666 |publisher=ANC |accessdate=15 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116104233/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=4666 |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cotula|first=Lorenzo|title=Gender and Law: Women's Rights in Agriculture|year=2006|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=9789251055632|pages=46\u201352|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPDXvKekn0IC|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref> Jobs were often hard to find.

Lack of funds to provide proper equipment would be noticeable in regards to black amateur football matches; this revealed the unequal lives black South Africans were subject to, in contrast to Whites, who were much better off financially.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alegi|first=Peter|year=2004|title=Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa|publisher=University of KwaZula-Natal Press|page=59}}</ref> Apartheid's social engineering made it more difficult to compete across racial lines. Thus, in an effort to centralise finances, the federations merged in 1951, creating the South African Soccer Federation (SASF), which brought Black, Indian, and Coloured national associations into one body that opposed apartheid. This was generally opposed more and more by the growing apartheid government, and{{snds}}with urban segregation being reinforced with ongoing racist policies{{snds}}it was harder to play football along these racial lines. In 1956, the Pretoria regime{{snds}}the administrative capital of South Africa{{snds}}passed the first apartheid sports policy; by doing so, it emphasised the White-led government's opposition to inter-racialism.\n\nWhile football was plagued by racism, it also played a role in protesting apartheid and its policies. With the international bans from [[FIFA]] and other major sporting events, South Africa would be in the spotlight internationally. In a 1977 survey, white South Africans ranked the lack of international sport as one of the three most damaging consequences of apartheid.<ref name=robnixon>{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Rob|year=1992|title=Apartheid on the Run: The South African Sports Boycott|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=75, 77}}</ref> By the mid-1950s, Black South Africans would also use media to challenge the \"racialisation\" of sports in South Africa; anti-apartheid forces had begun to pinpoint sport as the \"weakness\" of white national morale. Black journalists for the ''Johannesburg Drum'' magazine were the first to give the issue public exposure, with an intrepid special issue in 1955 that asked, \"Why shouldn't our blacks be allowed in the SA team?\"<ref name=robnixon /> As time progressed, international standing with South Africa would continue to be strained. In the 1980s, as the oppressive system was slowly collapsing the ANC and National Party started negotiations on the end of apartheid. Football associations also discussed the formation of a single, non-racial controlling body. This unity process accelerated in the late 1980s and led to the creation, in December 1991, of an incorporated South African Football Association. On 3 July 1992, FIFA finally welcomed South Africa back into international football.\n\nSport has long been an important part of life in South Africa, and the boycotting of games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population, perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did. After the re-acceptance of South Africa's sports teams by the international community, sport played a major unifying role between the country's diverse ethnic groups. Mandela's open support of the predominantly white rugby fraternity during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was considered instrumental in bringing together South African sports fans of all races.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nauright|first=John|year=2004|title=Global Games: Culture, Political Economy and Sport in the Globalised World of the 21st Century|url=|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=25|issue=7|pages=1325\u201336|doi=10.1080/014365904200281302}}</ref>\n\n=== Asians during apartheid ===\n{{Further|Indian South Africans|Asian South Africans|Chinese South Africans}}\nDefining its Asian population, a minority that did not appear to belong to any of the initial three designated non-white groups, was a constant dilemma for the apartheid government.\n\nFor political reasons, the classification of \"[[honorary white]]\" was granted to immigrants from [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]]{{snds}}countries with which South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relations<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinajournal/2008/06/19/in-south-africa-chinese-is-the-new-black|date=19 June 2008|title=In South Africa, Chinese is the New Black|publisher=China Realtime Report}}</ref>{{snds}}and to their descendants.\n\n[[Indian South Africans]] during apartheid were classified many ranges of categories from \"Asian\" to \"black\" {{clarify|date=June 2014}} to \"Coloured\" {{clarify|date=June 2014}} and even the mono-ethnic category of \"Indian\", but never as white, having been considered \"nonwhite\" throughout South Africa's history. The group faced severe discrimination during the apartheid regime and were subject to numerous racialist policies.\n\nIn a study done by Josephine C. Naidoo and Devi Moodley Rajab, they interviewed a series of Indian South Africans about their experience in South Africa. Their study highlighted education, the workplace, and general day to day living. For one specific participant who was a doctor, said that it was considered the norm for Non-White and White doctors to mingle while working at the hospital but when there was any down time or breaks, they were to go back to their segregated quarters. Not only was there severe segregation for doctors, Non-White, more specifically Indians, were paid three to four times less than their White counterparts. Many described being treated as a \u201cthird class citizen\u201d due to the humiliation of the standard of treatment for Non-White employees across many professions. Many Indians described a sense of justified superiority from Whites due to the apartheid laws that, in the minds of White South Africans, legitimised those feelings. Another finding of this study was the psychological damage done to Indians living in South Africa during apartheid. One of the biggest long-term effects was inter-racial mistrust. Inter-racial mistrust is emotional hatred towards Whites. There was such a strong degree of alienation that left damaging psychological effects of inferiority.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/097133360501700204|title = The Dynamics of Oppression| journal=Psychology and Developing Societies| volume=17| issue=2| pages=139\u2013159|year = 2005|last1 = Naidoo|first1 = Josephine C.| last2=Rajab| first2=Devi Moodley}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese South Africans]]{{snds}}who were descendants of migrant workers who came to work in the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] around Johannesburg in the late 19th century{{snds}}were initially either classified as \"Coloured\" or \"Other Asian\" and were subject to numerous forms of discrimination and restriction.<ref name=\"Sze memoir\">{{cite book|last1=Sze |first1=Szeming |title=World War II Memoirs, 1941\u20131945 |date=2014 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |location=Pittsburgh |page=42 |edition=Digital |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=31735066261615;view=toc;c=ulstext |accessdate=7 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108030328/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=31735066261615%3Bview%3Dtoc%3Bc%3Dulstext |archivedate=8 November 2014 }}</ref> It was not until 1984 that [[Chinese South Africans|South African Chinese]], increased to about 10,000, were given the same official rights as the [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]], to be treated as whites in terms of the Group Areas Act, although they still faced discrimination and did not receive all the benefits/rights of their newly obtained honorary white status such as voting.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Overseas Indonesians|Indonesians]] arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as slaves until the abolishment of slavery during the 1800s.

The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action, a series of [[Strike action|strikes]], [[boycott]]s and [[civil disobedience]] actions that led to occasional violent clashes with the authorities.\n\nIn 1959, a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC), which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of those protests was held in the township of [[Sharpeville]], where 69 people were killed by police in the [[Sharpeville massacre]].\n\nIn the wake of Sharpeville, the government declared a [[state of emergency]]. More than 18,000 people were arrested, including leaders of the ANC and PAC, and both organisations were banned. The resistance went underground, with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of [[Sabotage|domestic sabotage]] and [[terrorism]].\n\nIn May 1961, before the declaration of South Africa as a Republic, an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings, threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored.\n\nWhen the government overlooked them, the strikers (among the main organisers was a 42-year-old, [[Thembu]]-origin [[Nelson Mandela]]) carried out their threats. The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938112,00.html A War Won], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 9 June 1961</ref> Defeated, the protesters called off their strike. The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures. Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Blood River]].\n\nIn the 1970s, the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM) was created by [[Tertiary education|tertiary students]] influenced by the Black Power movement in the US. BCM endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system. The leader of the movement, [[Steve Biko]], was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was beaten to death in detention.\n\nIn 1976, secondary students in Soweto took to the streets in the [[Soweto uprising]] to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans as the only language of instruction. On 16 June, police opened fire on students protesting peacefully. According to official reports 23 people were killed, but the number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheid/a/Soweto-Uprising-Pt2.htm 16 June 1976 Student Uprising in Soweto]. africanhistory.about.com</ref><ref name=\"Harrison1987\">{{cite book|title=The White Tribe of Africa|year=1987|first=David|last=Harrison}}</ref><ref>([[Les Payne]] of Newsday said at least 850 murders were documented) Elsabe Brink; Gandhi Malungane; Steve Lebelo; Dumisani Ntshangase; Sue Krige, ''Soweto 16 June 1976'', 2001, 9</ref> In the following years several student organisations were formed to protest against apartheid, and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 and rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986.\n[[File:MK Attacks.JPG|thumb|left|250px|List of attacks attributed to MK and compiled by the Committee for South African War Resistance (COSAWR) between 1980 and 1983.]]\nIn parallel with student protests, labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974. After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, filling the gap left by the banning of political parties. In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining, although strikes were still illegal. Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] wrote that basic [[supply and demand]] led to violations of Apartheid \"on a massive scale\" throughout the nation, simply because there were not enough white South African business owners to meet the demand for various goods and services. Large portions of the garment industry and construction of new homes, for example, were effectively owned and operated by blacks, who either worked surreptitiously or who circumvented the law with a white person as a nominal, figurehead manager.<ref>Sowell, Thomas (2004, 2009). ''Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One''. Second Edition, NY: Basic Books. Ch. 7: The Economics of Discrimination.</ref>\n\nIn 1983, anti-apartheid leaders determined to resist the tricameral parliament assembled to form the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) in order to coordinate anti-apartheid activism inside South Africa. The first presidents of the UDF were [[Archie Gumede]], [[Oscar Mpetha]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]]; patrons were Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], Dr [[Allan Boesak]], [[Helen Joseph]], and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Basing its platform on abolishing apartheid and creating a nonracial democratic South Africa, the UDF provided a legal way for domestic human rights groups and individuals of all races to organise demonstrations and campaign against apartheid inside the country. Churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance. Church leaders were not immune to prosecution, and certain faith-based organisations were banned, but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did. The UDF, coupled with the protection of the church, accordingly permitted a major role for Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], who served both as a prominent domestic voice and international spokesperson denouncing apartheid and urging the creation of a shared nonracial state.<ref>Nelson Mandela Foundation,  [https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv03188/06lv03222.htm United Democratic Front]</ref>\n\nAlthough the majority of whites supported apartheid, some 20 percent did not. Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by [[Helen Suzman]], [[Colin Eglin]] and [[Harry Schwarz]], who formed the [[Progressive Federal Party]]. Extra-parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the [[South African Communist Party]] and women's organisation the [[Black Sash]]. Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties.\n\n== International relations during apartheid ==\n{{International opposition to Apartheid}}\n{{Main|Foreign relations of South Africa during apartheid}}\n\n=== Commonwealth ===\nSouth Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] criticised them during his [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]] speech in [[Cape Town]]. Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the [[Sharpeville Massacre]], resulting in more international condemnation. Soon afterwards, [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] announced a [[1960 South Africa referendum|referendum]] on whether the country should become a republic. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for Whites to eighteen years of age and included Whites in [[South West Africa]] on the roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked Whites; \"Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union?\", and 52 percent voted \"Yes\".{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAs a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with which it had privileged trade links. [[India]] had become a [[republic within the Commonwealth]] in 1950, but it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence.\n\n=== United Nations ===\n{{quote|We stand here today to salute the United Nations Organisation and its Member States, both singly and collectively, for joining forces with the masses of our people in a common struggle that has brought about our emancipation and pushed back the frontiers of racism.| [[Nelson Mandela]], address to the United Nations as South African President, 3 October 1994<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/apartheid.shtml Nelson Mandela] United Nations</ref>}}\n\nThe apartheid system as an issue was first formally brought to the [[United Nations]] attention, in order to advocate for the Indians residing in South Africa. On June 22 of 1946, the Indian government requested that the discriminatory treatment of Indians living in South Africa be included on the agenda of the first General Assembly session.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Remarks at memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg, 10 December 2013|date=2016-12-16|doi = 10.18356/c18bc974-en}}</ref> In 1952, apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although South Africa's racial policies were a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction.<ref>Ampiah, Kweku (1997). ''The dynamics of Japan's relations with Africa: South Africa, Tanzania and Nigeria.'' CRC Press. p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn April 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed following the [[Sharpeville massacre]], and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 134|Resolution 134]] called upon the nation of South Africa to abandon its policies implementing racial discrimination. The newly founded United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, scripted and passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 181|Resolution 181]] on August 7, 1963, which called upon all states to cease the sale and shipment of all ammunition and military vehicles to South Africa. This clause, was finally declared mandatory on 4 November 1977, depriving South Africa of military aide.  From 1964 onwards, the US and the UK discontinued their [[Arms industry|arms trade]] with South Africa. The Security Council also condemned the Soweto massacre in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 392|Resolution 392]]. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|Resolution 418]]. In addition to isolating South Africa militarily, the United Nations General Assembly, encouraged the boycotting of oil sales to South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Remarks at memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg, 10 December 2013|date=2016-12-16|doi = 10.18356/c18bc974-en}}</ref> Other actions taken by the United Nations General Assembly include the request for all nations and organisations, \u201cto suspend cultural, educational, sporting and other exchanges with the racist regime and with organisations or institutions in South Africa which practice apartheid\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Remarks at memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg, 10 December 2013|date=2016-12-16|doi = 10.18356/c18bc974-en}}</ref> Illustrating that over a long period of time, the United Nations was working towards isolating the state of South Africa, by putting pressure on the Apartheid regime.\n\nAfter much debate, by the late-1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A [[disinvestment from South Africa]] movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/guide/antia.htm|title=Summary of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|publisher=[[United States Congress]]|accessdate=22 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722054047/http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/guide/antia.htm|archive-date=22 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope John Paul II]] was an outspoken opponent of apartheid.

Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa. It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa.

''Introduction to African politics: a continental approach.'' Praeger. p. 128.</ref>\n\nSouth Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to its policies brought about another OAU announcement in October 1971. The ''Mogadishu Declaration'' stated that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that its Black people could only be freed through military means, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government.<ref>Klotz, Audie (1999). ''Norms in International Relations: The Struggle Against Apartheid.'' Cornell University Press. p. 77.</ref>\n\n=== Outward-looking policy ===\n\nIn 1966, [[B. J. Vorster]] became Prime Minister. He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's isolation and to revitalise the country's global reputation, even those with Black majority rule in Africa. This he called his \"Outward-Looking\" policy.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pfister|first=Roger |title=Apartheid South Africa and African States: From Pariah to Middle Power, 1962\u20131994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YABvZRghzkAC&pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-625-6|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Beck|first=Roger B. |title=The History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313307300|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313307300/page/151 151]|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30730-0|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ndlovu|first=Sifiso Mxolisi|title=The Road to Democracy in South Africa: 1970\u20131980|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGE-XB5QlD8C&pg=PA616|volume=2|year=2004|publisher=Unisa Press|isbn=978-1-86888-406-3|chapter=The ANC's Diplomacy and International Relations}}</ref>\n\nVorster's willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd's refusal to engage with leaders such as [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] of [[Nigeria]] in 1962 and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]] in 1964. In 1966, he met the heads of the neighbouring states of [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Botswana]]. In 1967, he offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that no political strings were attached, aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa's racial policies. Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working down the South African mines. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid, but were dependent on South African economic assistance.\n\n[[Malawi]] was the first not-neighbouring country to accept South African aid. In 1967, the two states set out their political and economic relations. In 1969, Malawi was the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto condemning South Africa' apartheid policy. In 1970, Malawian president [[Hastings Banda]] made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa.\n\nAssociations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]], Madagascar, [[Mauritius]], Gabon, [[Zaire]] (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the [[Central African Republic]]. Although these states condemned apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), South Africa's economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees{{clarify|date=September 2014}}.\n\n=== Sports and culture ===\n{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa|Rugby union and apartheid}}\n\n====Beginning====\nSouth Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of them having players of different races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] severed its ties with the all-White South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.\n\n====Isolation====\n\n====Verwoerd years====\nIn 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with White establishments, SASA approached the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, they would be barred from competing at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games]] in [[Tokyo]]. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Olympic Games. South Africa selected a multi-racial team for the next Olympic Games, and the IOC opted for incorporation in the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympic Games]]. Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation.\n\nForeign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa, until the 1970 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour allowed [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] to enter the country under the status of \"honorary Whites\". Huge and widespread protests occurred in [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|New Zealand in 1981]] against the [[Springboks|Springbok]] tour{{snds}}the government spent $8,000,000 protecting games using the army and police force. A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protesters and it was cancelled. A \"rebel tour\"{{snds}}not government sanctioned{{snds}}went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.<ref>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour The 1981 Springbok rugby tour{{snds}}A country divided]. New Zealand History Online.</ref>\n\n=====Vorster years=====\nOn 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was fatally stabbed at Parliament House by parliamentary messenger [[Dimitri Tsafendas]], who was arrested and quickly imprisoned. [[John Vorster]] took office shortly after, and announced that South Africa would no longer dictate to the international community what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for international sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. \"Dolly\" was eventually included in the team as the first substitute, but the tour was cancelled. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, including that of an England rugby team touring South Africa in 1969/70.\n\nThe first of the \"White Bans\" occurred in 1971 when the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing Association{{snds}}[[Don Bradman|Sir Don Bradman]]{{snds}}flew to South Africa to meet Vorster. Vorster had expected Bradman to allow the tour of the Australian cricket team to go ahead, but things became heated after Bradman asked why Black sportsmen were not allowed to play cricket. Vorster stated that Blacks were intellectually inferior and had no finesse for the game. Bradman{{snds}}thinking this ignorant and repugnant{{snds}}asked Vorster if he had heard of a man named [[Garry Sobers]]. On his return to [[Australia]], Bradman released a short statement: \"We will not play them until they choose a team on a non-racist basis.\"<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/the-day-apartheid-was-hit-for-six/2008/08/22/1219262525329.html The Day Apartheid Was Hit For Six]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.</ref>  Bradman's views were in stark contrast to those of Australian tennis great [[Margaret Court]], who had won the [[grand slam (tennis)|grand slam]] the previous year and commented about apartheid that \"South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America\" and that she would \"go back there any time.\"<ref>{{cite news|title = Margaret Court: astounding champion who found God and lost the respect of a nation|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/03/margaret-court-astounding-champion-who-found-god-and-lost-the-respect-of-a-nation|work = [[Guardian Australia]]|first = Russell|last = Jackson|accessdate = 7 November 2019|date = 3 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn South Africa, Vorster vented his anger publicly against Bradman, while the African National Congress rejoiced. This was the first time a predominantly White nation had taken the side of multiracial sport, producing an unsettling resonance that more \"White\" boycotts were coming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamcricket.com/community/blogs/cover_points/archive/2008/08/23/bradman-s-perfection.aspx |title=Bradman's Perfection |publisher=DreamCricket |accessdate=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710151045/http://www.dreamcricket.com/community/blogs/cover_points/archive/2008/08/23/bradman-s-perfection.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nAlmost twenty years later, on his release from prison, Nelson Mandela asked a visiting Australian statesman if Donald Bradman, his childhood hero, was still alive (Bradman lived until 2001).\n\nIn 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations.\n\nIn [[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978]], Nigeria [[boycott]]ed the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]]. Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] because of UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://experts.about.com/e/c/co/Commonwealth_Games.htm|title=Commonwealth Games|publisher=About.com|accessdate=7 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060527215130/http://experts.about.com/e/c/co/Commonwealth_Games.htm| archivedate=27 May 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Cultural boycott====\nIn the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for ''cultural'' boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor [[Marlon Brando]] called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in the United Kingdom and the United States was also vetoed.{{by whom|date=December 2018}} After the arrival of [[TV|television]] in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union, [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Similarly, when [[home video]] grew popular in the 1980s, the Australian arm of [[CBS/Fox Video]] (now [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]) placed stickers on their [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] cassettes which labeled exporting such cassettes to South Africa as \"an infringement of copyright\".<ref>https://vhscollector.com/sites/default/files/vhs/domino-principal-vhs-5-29047.jpg</ref> Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions,{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid.\n\n=== Western influence ===\n[[File:Boycott Apartheid Bus, London, UK. 1989.jpg|thumb|London \"Boycott Apartheid\" bus, 1989]]\nWhile international opposition to apartheid grew, the [[Nordic countries]]{{snds}}and [[Sweden]] in particular{{snds}}provided both moral and financial support for the [[African National Congress|ANC]].<ref>International Labour Office (1991).

In the 1980s, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration and the Thatcher ministry in the UK followed a \"[[constructive engagement]]\" policy with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions, justified by a belief in free trade and a vision of South Africa as a bastion against [[Marxist]] forces in Southern Africa.

It set up a powerful [[State Security Council|state security apparatus]] to \"protect\" the state against an anticipated upsurge in [[political violence]] that the reforms were expected to trigger. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as [[Counterintelligence state|securocrats]]), who managed the various States of Emergencies.<ref>Fox, William; Fourie, Marius; Van Wyk, Belinda (1998). ''Police Management in South Africa.'' Juta and Company Limited. p. 167.</ref>\n\nBotha's years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa, as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate [[SWAPO]] in Namibia. Within South Africa, meanwhile, vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans, and an effective end to the African National Congress' sabotage campaign.\n\nThe government punished political offenders brutally. 40,000 people annually were subjected to [[Flagellation|whipping]] as a form of punishment.<ref>Anzovin, Steven (1987).

Led by the [[Reverend]] [[Allan Boesak]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]], the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish the apartheid system and eliminate the homelands completely.\n\n=== State of emergency ===\nSerious political violence was a prominent feature from 1985\u201389, as Black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti-apartheid organisations and the Botha government. Throughout the 1980s, township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities. The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders, who were seen to be supporting the government. By 1985, it had become the ANC's aim to make Black townships \"ungovernable\" (a term later replaced by \"people's power\") by means of rent boycotts and other militant action. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. People's courts were set up, and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishments. Black town councillors and policemen, and sometimes their families, were attacked with petrol bombs, beaten, and murdered by [[necklacing]], where a burning tyre was placed around the victim's neck, after they were restrained by wrapping their wrists with barbed wire. This signature act of torture and murder was embraced by the ANC and its leaders.\n\nOn 20 July 1985, Botha declared a [[State of Emergency]] in 36 magisterial districts. Areas affected were the [[Eastern Cape]], and the [[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging|PWV]] region (\"[[Pretoria]], [[Witwatersrand]], [[Vereeniging]]\").<ref>Pomeroy, William J. (1986). ''Apartheid, imperialism, and African freedom.'' International Publishers. p. 226. {{ISBN|978-0-7178-0640-9}}.</ref> Three months later, the [[Western Cape]] was included. An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed (restricted in some way); many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them. During this state of emergency, about 2,436 people were detained under the [[Internal Security Act, 1982|Internal Security Act]].<ref>Legum, Colin (1989). ''Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents, Volume 20.'' Africana Pub. Co. p. 668.</ref>  This act gave police and the military sweeping powers. The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people. The president could [[rule by decree]] without referring to the constitution or to parliament. It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening, to advise anyone to stay away from work or to oppose the government, and to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government released that name, with up to ten years' imprisonment for these offences. [[Indefinite detention|Detention without trial]] became a common feature of the government's reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988, 30,000 people had been detained.<ref>McKendrick, Brian; Hoffmann, Wilman (1990).

Oxford University Press. p. 62.</ref> The media was [[Censorship|censored]], thousands were arrested and many were [[Interrogation|interrogated]] and [[torture]]d.<ref>Blond, Rebecca; Fitzpatrick, Mary (2004). ''South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland.'' Lonely Planet. p. 40.</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1986, four days before the tenth anniversary of the Soweto uprising, the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country. The government amended the Public Security Act, including the right to declare \"unrest\" areas, allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas. Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government's strategy and [[Professional video camera|television cameras]] were banned from entering such areas. The [[State media|state broadcaster]], the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC), provided propaganda in support of the government. Media opposition to the system increased, supported by the growth of a pro-ANC [[underground press]] within South Africa.\n\nIn 1987, the State of Emergency was extended for another two years. Meanwhile, about 200,000 members of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (South Africa)|National Union of Mineworkers]] commenced the longest strike (three weeks) in South African history. The year 1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti-apartheid organisations.\n\nMuch of the violence in the late-1980s and early-1990s was directed at the government, but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves. Many died in violence between members of [[Inkatha Freedom Party|Inkatha]] and the UDF-ANC faction. It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other whenever it suited them. Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad; they undertook cross-border army and air-force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases. The ANC and the PAC in return detonated bombs at restaurants, shopping centres and government buildings such as [[Magistrates' court|magistrates courts]].

South African troops withdrew from Angola early in 1976, failing to prevent the [[MPLA]] from gaining power there, and Black students in South Africa celebrated.\n\nThe [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]], signed by [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] and [[Harry Schwarz]] in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]]. It caused a split in the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] that ultimately realigned oppositional politics in South Africa with the formation of the [[Progressive Federal Party]] in 1977. The Declaration was the first of several such joint agreements by acknowledged Black and White political leaders in South Africa.\n\nIn 1978, the National Party Defence Minister, [[Pieter Willem Botha]], became Prime Minister. His white minority regime worried about Soviet aid to revolutionaries in South Africa at the same time that South African economic growth had slowed. The South African Government noted that it was spending too much money to maintain segregated homelands created for Blacks, and the homelands were proving to be uneconomical.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nNor was maintaining Blacks as third-class citizens working well. Black labour remained vital to the economy, and illegal Black labour unions were flourishing. Many Blacks remained too poor to contribute significantly to the economy through their purchasing power{{snds}}although they composed  more than 70% of the population. Botha's regime feared that an antidote was needed to prevent the Blacks' being attracted to Communism.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Democratization in South Africa|last = Giliomee|first = Hermann|date = 1995|journal = Political Science Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nIn July 1979, the Nigerian Government alleged that the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) was selling Nigerian oil to South Africa, though there was little evidence or commercial logic for such sales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weymouth Genova|first=Ann |title=Oil and Nationalism in Nigeria, 1970\u20131980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T3NVGzBmkUC&pg=PA123|accessdate=11 April 2012|year=2007|isbn=978-0-549-26666-2|page=123}} Weymouth Genova covers the possibility of Nigerian oil going to South Africa in detail from page 113.

The government allowed Mandela more visitors, including visits and interviews by foreigners, to let the world know that he was being treated well.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nBlack homelands were declared [[nation-state]]s and [[pass laws]] were abolished. Black labour unions were legitimised, the government recognised the right of Blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave Blacks [[property rights]] there. Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sexual relations between different races, which was under ridicule abroad. The spending for Black schools increased, to one-seventh of what was spent per White child, up from on one-sixteenth in 1968. At the same time, attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus.\n\nIn January 1985, Botha addressed the government's House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives. Mandela's reply was read in public by his daughter Zinzi{{snds}}his first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty-one years before. Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence. The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants. This response helped to further elevate Mandela's status in the eyes of those, both internationally and domestically, who opposed apartheid.\n\nBetween 1986\u201388, some petty apartheid laws were repealed, along with the pass laws.<ref name=\"saHistoryPassLaws\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=21 March 2011|work=South African History Online|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> Botha told [[White South Africans]] to \"adapt or die\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916936,00.html South Africa: Adapt or Die]. ''Time''.</ref> and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as \"[[Point of no return|rubicon]]\" announcements of substantial reforms, although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes. Ironically, these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the 1980s as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement. Botha's government stopped short of substantial reforms, such as lifting the ban on the ANC, PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations, releasing political prisoners, or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid. The government's stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations \"renounced violence\".\n\nBy 1987, South Africa's economy was growing at one of the lowest rates in the world, and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many Whites in South Africa. Examples of African states with Black leaders and White minorities existed in [[Kenya]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Whispers of South Africa one day having a Black President sent more hardline Whites into supporting right-wing political parties. Mandela was moved to a four-bedroom house of his own, with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees, on a prison farm just outside of Cape Town. He had an unpublicised meeting with Botha. Botha impressed Mandela by walking forward, extending his hand and pouring Mandela's tea. The two had a friendly discussion, with Mandela comparing the African National Congress' rebellion with that of the [[Afrikaner rebellion]] and talking about everyone being brothers.\n\nA number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC-in-exile and various sectors of the internal struggle, such as women and educationalists. More overtly, a group of White intellectuals met the ANC in [[Senegal]] for talks known as the [[Dakar Conference]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberfeld | first1 = Daniel | year = 2002 | title = Evaluating the Contributions of Track-two Diplomacy to Conflict Termination in South Africa, 1984\u201390 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2cb14e2f301357410bdbe2710c5899b992e41d4| journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 355\u2013372 | doi = 10.1177/0022343302039003006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of F.

Sharpe. p. 23. {{ISBN|978-0-87332-877-7}}.</ref> He was succeeded as President later that year by [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]]. Despite his initial reputation as a conservative, de Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country. Prior to his term in office, F.W De Klerk had already experienced political success as a result of the power base he had built in the Transvaal. During this time, F.W De Klerk served as chairman to the provincial National Party, which was in favor of the Apartheid regime. The transition of de Klerk's ideology regarding apartheid is seen clearly in his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990. F.W de Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]]. The Land Act was brought to an end. De Klerk also made his first public commitment to release Nelson Mandela, to return to [[press freedom]] and to suspend the death penalty. Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of [[common law]] crimes were released.\n\nOn 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from [[Victor Verster Prison]] after more than 27 years behind bars.\n\nHaving been instructed by the [[UN Security Council]] to end its long-standing involvement in South West Africa/[[Namibia]], and in the face of military stalemate in Southern Angola, and an escalation in the size and cost of the combat with the Cubans, the Angolans, and SWAPO forces and the growing cost of the border war, South Africa negotiated a change of control; [[Namibia]] became independent on 21 March 1990.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\n{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}\nApartheid was dismantled in a series of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiations]] from 1990\u201391, culminating in a transitional period which resulted in the country's [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]], the first in South Africa held with [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1990, negotiations were earnestly begun, with two meetings between the government and the ANC. The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition towards majority rule. These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations, despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country. Apartheid legislation was abolished in 1991.<ref name=\"Abolished\"/>\n\nAt the first meeting, the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin. The meeting was held at [[Groote Schuur]], the President's official residence. They released the Groote Schuur Minute, which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return.\n\nThere were fears that the change of power would be violent. To avoid this, it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached. In December 1991, the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|Convention for a Democratic South Africa]] (CODESA) began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial [[Provisional government|transitional government]] and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups. CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an \"undivided South Africa\".\n\nReforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] White opposition, leading to the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] winning a number of by-elections against NP candidates. De Klerk responded by calling a Whites-only [[1992 South African Referendum|referendum]] in March 1992 to decide whether negotiations should continue. 68% voted in favour, and the victory instilled in de Klerk and the government a lot more confidence, giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations.\n\nWhen negotiations resumed in May 1992, under the tag of CODESA II, stronger demands were made. The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy. The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government, and the power to change decisions made by parliament.\n\nPersistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations. This was due mostly to the intense rivalry between the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP) and the ANC and the eruption of some traditional tribal and local rivalries between the Zulu and Xhosa historical tribal affinities, especially in the Southern Natal provinces. Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences, they could not stem the violence. One of the worst cases of ANC-IFP violence was the [[Boipatong massacre]] of 17 June 1992, when 200 IFP militants attacked the [[Gauteng]] township of [[Boipatong]], killing 45. Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles, supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence. Subsequent judicial inquiries found the evidence of the witnesses to be unreliable or discredited, and that there was no evidence of National Party or police involvement in the massacre.  When de Klerk visited the scene of the incident he was initially warmly welcomed, but he was suddenly confronted by a crowd of protesters brandishing stones and placards.  The motorcade sped from the scene as police tried to hold back the crowd.  Shots were fired by the police, and the PAC stated that three of its supporters had been gunned down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975920-1,00.html|work=Time |title=Enemies: Black vs. Black vs. White|first=Scott|last=Macleod|date=7 July 1992}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Boipatong massacre offered the ANC a pretext to engage in brinkmanship.  Mandela argued that de Klerk, as head of state, was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed. He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC-IFP violence. This formed the basis for ANC's withdrawal from the negotiations, and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage.\n\nThe [[Bisho massacre]] on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head. The [[Ciskei Defence Force]] killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the [[Ciskei]] homeland into South Africa. In the aftermath, Mandela and de Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence. This led to a resumption of negotiations.\n\nRight-wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period. The assassination of [[Chris Hani]] on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos. Hani, the popular General Secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), was assassinated in 1993 in [[Dawn Park]] in [[Johannesburg]] by [[Janusz Walu\u015b]], an [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] [[Poles|Polish]] refugee who had close links to the White nationalist [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB). Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela; his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the [[international community]], but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination.<ref name=turningpoints>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm |title=Turning Points in History Book 6: Negotiation, Transition and Freedom |accessdate=3 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309124114/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm |archivedate=9 March 2008 }}</ref> On 25 June 1993, the AWB used an armoured vehicle to [[Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre|crash through the doors]] of the [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council, though this did not derail the process.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn addition to the continuing \"black-on-black\" violence, there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC's military wing, the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA). The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry, impatient youth. In the [[St James Church massacre]] on 25 July 1993, members of the APLA opened fire in a church in Cape Town, killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58.\n\nIn 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] \"for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1993|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1993|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=27 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060620040422/http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1993/| archivedate=20 June 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nViolence persisted right up to the 1994 general election.

There were strong protests against his decision, leading to a [[Bophuthatswana coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat in Bophuthatswana]] on 10 March that deposed Mangope, despite the intervention of white right-wingers hoping to maintain him in power.

Nevertheless, by 1948 it remained apparent that there were gaps in the [[social structure]], whether legislated or otherwise, concerning the rights and opportunities of nonwhites. The rapid [[economic development]] of [[World War II]] attracted black migrant workers in large numbers to chief industrial centres, where they compensated for the wartime shortage of white labour. However, this escalated rate of black urbanisation went unrecognised by the South African government, which failed to accommodate the influx with parallel expansion in housing or [[social services]].<ref name=\"zastudy\" /> Overcrowding, spiking [[Crime statistics|crime rates]], and disillusionment resulted; urban blacks came to support a new generation of leaders influenced by the principles of self-determination and popular freedoms enshrined in such statements as the [[Atlantic Charter]].

A second faction were the \"purists\", who believed in \"vertical segregation\", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term. A third faction, which included [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], sympathised with the purists, but allowed for the use of black labour, while implementing the purist goal of vertical separation.<ref name=\"Kuperus1999\">{{cite book|author=T.

Such groups were split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and [[Afrikaans]] language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups.\n\nThe state passed laws that paved the way for \"grand apartheid\", which was centred on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race. This strategy was in part adopted from \"left-over\" British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the [[Boer republics]] in the [[Anglo-Boer war]]. This created the black-only \"[[township]]s\" or \"locations\", where blacks were relocated to their own towns. In addition, \"petty apartheid\" laws were passed. The principal apartheid laws were as follows.<ref name=\"b\">Alistair Boddy-Evans.

The [[Suppression of Communism Act]] of 1950 banned any party subscribing to [[Communism]].  The act defined Communism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposed [[Public policy|government policy]] risked being labelled as a Communist.  Since the law specifically stated that Communism aimed to disrupt racial harmony, it was frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings were banned, as were certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government.\n\nThe [[Bantu Authorities Act, 1951|Bantu Authorities Act of 1951]] created separate government structures for blacks and whites and was the first piece of legislation to support the government's plan of separate development in the [[bantustan]]s. The [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Black Self-Government Act]] of 1959 entrenched the NP policy of nominally independent \"[[homeland]]s\" for blacks. So-called \"self\u2013governing Bantu units\" were proposed, which would have devolved administrative powers, with the promise later of [[autonomy]] and [[self-government]].  It also abolished the seats of white representatives of black South Africans and removed from the rolls the few blacks still qualified to vote. The [[Bantu Investment Corporation Act]] of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands to create employment there. Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in \"white\" cities and redirect such development to the \"homelands\". The [[Black Homeland Citizenship Act]] of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy. It changed the status of blacks to citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The aim was to ensure a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans achieve full independence.\n\nInterracial contact in sport was frowned upon, but there were no segregatory sports laws.\n\nThe government tightened pass laws compelling blacks to carry [[identity document]]s, to prevent the immigration of blacks from other countries. To reside in a city, blacks had to be in employment there. Until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these ''pass'' requirements, as attempts to introduce ''pass laws'' for women were met with fierce resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/un/womenrole.html |title=Extracts from paper prepared by the Secretariat for the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, Copenhagen, July 1980 (The anti-pass campaign) |accessdate=14 July 2008 |publisher=[[African National Congress]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622003552/http://www.anc.org.za/un/womenrole.html |archivedate=22 June 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Disenfranchisement of Coloured voters ===\n{{Main|Coloured vote constitutional crisis}}\n[[File:Cape-coloured-children.jpg|thumb|Cape Coloured children in [[Bonteheuwel]]]]\n[[File:Annual per capita personal income by race group in South Africa relative to white levels.svg|lang=en|thumb|Annual per capita personal income by race group in [[South Africa]] relative to white levels.]]\n\nIn 1950, D.

Once South Africa became a republic, Prime Minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] called for improved relations and greater accord between people of British descent and the Afrikaners.<ref>[[Doug Booth|Booth, Douglas]] (1998). ''The race game: sport and politics in South Africa.'' Routledge. p. 89.</ref>  He claimed that the only difference was between those in favour of apartheid and those against it. The ethnic division would no longer be between Afrikaans and English speakers, but between blacks and whites.\n\nMost Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety. White voters of British descent were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority \"no\" vote in [[Natal Province|Natal]].<ref>Thompson, Paul Singer (1990). ''Natalians first: separatism in South Africa, 1909\u20131961.'' Southern Book Publishers. p. 167.</ref> Later, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which concerned them. British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan|Harold Macmillan's]] \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]]\" speech left the British faction feeling that the United Kingdom had abandoned them.<ref>Joyce, Peter (2007).

There were, for example, the \"reserves\" created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, 13 percent of the land was reserved for black homelands, a small amount relative to its total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 justified apartheid and the homeland system, but stated that additional land ought to be given to the homelands, a recommendation that was not carried out.<ref>Evans, Ivan. Bureaucracy and Race: Native Administration in South Africa. Berkeley: U of California, 1997. N. pag. Print.</ref>\n\nWhen Verwoerd became Prime Minister in 1958, the policy of \"separate development\" came into being, with the homeland structure as one of its cornerstones. Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of independence to these homelands. The government justified its plans on the ostensible basis that \"(the) government's policy is, therefore, not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood, of different nations, granting to each self-determination within the borders of their homelands{{snds}}hence this policy of separate development\".<ref>Amisi, Baruti, and Simphiwe Nojiyeza.

In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act was passed, and border industries and the [[Bantu Investment Corporation Act, 1959|Bantu Investment Corporation]] were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in or near the homelands. Many black South Africans who had never resided in their identified homeland were forcibly removed from the cities to the homelands.\n\nThe vision of a South Africa divided into multiple [[ethno-state]]s appealed to the reform-minded Afrikaner intelligensia, and it provided a more coherent philosophical and moral framework for the National Party's policies, while also providing a veneer of intellectual respectability to the controversial policy of so-called [[baasskap]].<ref name=\"sparksNews24Appalled\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/AllisterSparks/Verwoerd-and-his-policies-appalled-me-20150512|title=Verwoerd and his policies appalled me|work=News24|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"politicsWebRememberingVerwoerd\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/remembering-verwoerd|title=Remembering Verwoerd - OPINION {{!}} Politicsweb|website=www.politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"afrikanerDominationNews24\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afrikaner-domination-died-with-verwoerd-50-years-ago-20160906|title=Afrikaner domination died with Verwoerd 50 years ago|work=News24|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n[[File:Ciskei2.jpg|thumb|left|Rural area in [[Ciskei]], one the four nominally independent homelands.]]\n\nIn total, 20 homelands were allocated to an ethnic groups, ten in South Africa proper and ten in South West Africa. Of these 20 homelands, 19 were classified as black, while one, [[Basterland]], was set aside for a sub-group of Coloureds known as [[Basters]], who are closely related to Afrikaners. Four of the homelands were declared independent by the South African government: [[Transkei]] in 1976, [[Bophuthatswana]] in 1977, [[Venda]] in 1979, and [[Ciskei]] in 1981 (known as the TBVC states). Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence, its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked and replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African.<ref name=\"travel\">Those who had the money to travel or emigrate were not given full passports; instead, travel documents were issued.</ref> The [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black citizens of the homelands and the problems which other countries faced through entry of [[illegal immigrants]].\n\n=== International recognition of the Bantustans ===\nBantustans within the borders of South Africa and South West Africa were classified by degree of nominal self-rule: 6 were \"non-self-governing\", 10 were \"self-governing\", and 4 were \"independent\". In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no significant economic infrastructure and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.\n\nThroughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the Swiss-South African Association encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a United States House of Representatives resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.<ref>http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf</ref> Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.\n\n=== Forced removals {{Anchor|Forced removal}} ===\n{{See also|1=Group Areas Act|2=Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991}}\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of \"resettlement\", to force people to move to their designated \"group areas\". Millions of people were forced to relocate. These removals included people relocated due to [[slum clearance]] programmes, labour tenants on white-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called \"black spots\" (black-owned land surrounded by white farms), the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and \"surplus people\" from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a \"Coloured Labour Preference Area\")<ref name=\"clp\">{{cite journal | last = Western | first = J. | title = A divided city: Cape Town | journal = [[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]] | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 711\u2013716 | doi = 10.1016/S0962-6298(02)00016-1 | date = June 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref> who were moved to the [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]] homelands.

Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police forced residents out of their homes and loaded their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land {{convert|19|km}} from the [[city centre]], known as [[Meadowlands, Gauteng|Meadowlands]], which the government had purchased in 1953. Meadowlands became part of a new [[Planned community|planned black city]] called [[Soweto]]. Sophiatown was destroyed by [[bulldozer]]s, and a new white suburb named [[Triomf]] (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to black South Africans alone. Forced removals from areas like [[Cato Manor]] (Mkhumbane) in [[Durban]], and [[District Six]] in [[Cape Town]], where 55,000 Coloured and [[Indian South Africans|Indian people]] were forced to move to new townships on the [[Cape Flats]], were carried out under the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950. Nearly 600,000 Coloured, Indian and [[Chinese South Africans|Chinese people]] were moved under the Group Areas Act.

The first of these was the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949|Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act 55 of 1949]], prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act 21 of 1950 (as amended in 1957 by Act 23) forbade \"unlawful racial intercourse\" and \"any immoral or indecent act\" between a white and a black, Indian or Coloured person.\n\nBlacks were not allowed to run businesses or professional practices in areas designated as \"white South Africa\" unless they had a permit - such being granted only exceptionally. They were required to move to the black \"homelands\" and set up businesses and practices there. Trains, hospitals and [[ambulance]]s were segregated.<ref>On apartheid transport see Pirie, G.H.

Blacks were excluded from working in white areas, unless they had a pass, nicknamed the ''dompas'', also spelt ''dompass'' or ''dom pass''. The most likely origin of this name is from the Afrikaans \"verdomde pas\" (meaning accursed pass),<ref name=\"dompass\">[http://www.dsae.co.za/#!/search/hws/dompass/sN/pN Dictionary of South African English on historical principles]. Retrieved 27 December 2015.</ref> although some commentators ascribe it to the Afrikaans words meaning \"dumb pass\". Only blacks with \"Section 10\" rights (those who had migrated to the cities before World War II) were excluded from this provision. A pass was issued only to a black with approved work. Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands. A pass was issued for one magisterial district (usually one town) confining the holder to that area only. Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant. This was often followed by deportation to the person's [[Bantustan|homeland]] and prosecution of the employer for employing an illegal migrant. Police vans patrolled white areas to round up blacks without passes. Blacks were not allowed to employ whites in white South Africa.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Conflict in South Africa|last = Saaty|first = Thomas|publisher = Springer Publishing|year = |isbn = |location = |page = 119}}</ref>\n\nAlthough trade unions for black and Coloured workers had existed since the early 20th century, it was not until the 1980s reforms that a mass black trade union movement developed. [[Trade unions in South Africa|Trade unions]] under apartheid were racially segregated, with 54 unions being white only, 38 for Indian and Coloured and 19 for black people. The Industrial Conciliation Act (1956) legislated against the creation of multi-racial trade unions and attempted to split existing multi-racial unions into separate branches or organisations along racial lines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Omond|first=Roger|title=The Apartheid Handbook|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=978-0-14-022749-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/apartheidhandboo0000omon_z0a2/page/102 102\u2013109]|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/apartheidhandboo0000omon_z0a2/page/102}}</ref>\n\nEach black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems. Blacks were not allowed to buy [[hard liquor]]. They were able only to buy state-produced poor quality beer (although this law was relaxed later). Public beaches, swimming pools, some [[Pedestrian separation structure|pedestrian bridges]], [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinema]] parking spaces, [[Cemetery|graveyards]], parks, and [[public toilet]]s were segregated. Cinemas and theatres in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks. There were practically no cinemas in black areas. Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff. Blacks were prohibited from attending white churches under the Churches Native Laws Amendment Act of 1957, but this was never rigidly enforced and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law. Blacks earning 360 [[South African rand|rand]] a year or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high, at 750 rand a year. On the other hand, the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nBlacks could never acquire land in white areas. In the homelands, much of the land belonged to a \"tribe\", where the local chieftain would decide how the land had to be used. This resulted in whites owning almost all the industrial and agricultural lands and much of the prized residential land. Most blacks were stripped of their South African citizenship when the \"homelands\" became \"independent\", and they were no longer able to apply for [[South African passport]]s. Eligibility requirements for a passport had been difficult for blacks to meet, the government contending that a passport was a privilege, not a right, and the government did not grant many passports to blacks. Apartheid pervaded culture as well as the law, and was entrenched by most of the [[Media of South Africa|mainstream media]].\n\n=== Coloured classification ===\n{{Discrimination sidebar}}\n{{Main|Coloureds}}\nThe population was classified into four groups: African, White, Indian and Coloured (capitalised to denote their legal definitions in [[Law of South Africa|South African law]]). The Coloured group included people regarded as being of mixed descent, including of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[Malay race|Malay]] ancestry. Many were descended from people brought to South Africa from other parts of the world, such as [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and [[China]] as [[slavery|slaves]] and [[Indentured labour|indentured workers]].<ref name=\"Intro\">Patric Tariq Mellet [https://archive.is/20120707062952/http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/intro/ \"Intro\"], ''Cape Slavery Heritage''.

People of Indian ancestry were considered Coloured under this act. Appearance, social and acceptance and descent were used to determine the qualification of an individual into one of the three categories. A white person was described by the act as one whose parents were both white and possessed the \"habits, speech, education, deportment and demeanour\" of a white person. Blacks were defined by the act as belonging to an African race or tribe.

Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or White, or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or Black. The tests included the [[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]], in which a pencil was shoved into the subject's curly hair and the subject made to shake their head. If the pencil stuck the person was deemed to be Black; if dislodged the person was pronounced Coloured.

They played an important role in the [[anti-apartheid movement]]: for example the [[African Political Organization]] established in 1902 had an exclusively Coloured membership.\n\nVoting rights were denied to Coloureds in the same way that they were denied to Blacks from 1950 to 1983. However, in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among Whites, and the [[Tricameral Parliament]] was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted [[Suffrage|voting rights]], but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands.<ref name=\"SAHistoryOrg\"/><ref name=\"GroupAreas1950\"/> These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] as a vehicle to try to prevent the co-option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with Whites. The battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans.\n\n=== Education ===\n[[Education in South Africa|Education]] was segregated by the 1953 [[Bantu Education Act]], which crafted a separate system of education for black South African students and was designed to prepare black people for lives as a labouring class.<ref name=\"byrnes\">{{cite book|last= Byrnes|first=Rita M.|title=South Africa: A Country Study|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|year=1996| location=Washington|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref> In 1959 separate universities were created for black, Coloured and Indian people.

Lack of funds to provide proper equipment would be noticeable in regards to black amateur football matches; this revealed the unequal lives black South Africans were subject to, in contrast to Whites, who were much better off financially.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alegi|first=Peter|year=2004|title=Laduma! Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa|publisher=University of KwaZula-Natal Press|page=59}}</ref> Apartheid's social engineering made it more difficult to compete across racial lines. Thus, in an effort to centralise finances, the federations merged in 1951, creating the South African Soccer Federation (SASF), which brought Black, Indian, and Coloured national associations into one body that opposed apartheid. This was generally opposed more and more by the growing apartheid government, and{{snds}}with urban segregation being reinforced with ongoing racist policies{{snds}}it was harder to play football along these racial lines. In 1956, the Pretoria regime{{snds}}the administrative capital of South Africa{{snds}}passed the first apartheid sports policy; by doing so, it emphasised the White-led government's opposition to inter-racialism.\n\nWhile football was plagued by racism, it also played a role in protesting apartheid and its policies. With the international bans from [[FIFA]] and other major sporting events, South Africa would be in the spotlight internationally. In a 1977 survey, white South Africans ranked the lack of international sport as one of the three most damaging consequences of apartheid.<ref name=robnixon>{{cite book|last=Nixon|first=Rob|year=1992|title=Apartheid on the Run: The South African Sports Boycott|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=75, 77}}</ref> By the mid-1950s, Black South Africans would also use media to challenge the \"racialisation\" of sports in South Africa; anti-apartheid forces had begun to pinpoint sport as the \"weakness\" of white national morale. Black journalists for the ''Johannesburg Drum'' magazine were the first to give the issue public exposure, with an intrepid special issue in 1955 that asked, \"Why shouldn't our blacks be allowed in the SA team?\"<ref name=robnixon /> As time progressed, international standing with South Africa would continue to be strained. In the 1980s, as the oppressive system was slowly collapsing the ANC and National Party started negotiations on the end of apartheid. Football associations also discussed the formation of a single, non-racial controlling body. This unity process accelerated in the late 1980s and led to the creation, in December 1991, of an incorporated South African Football Association. On 3 July 1992, FIFA finally welcomed South Africa back into international football.\n\nSport has long been an important part of life in South Africa, and the boycotting of games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population, perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did. After the re-acceptance of South Africa's sports teams by the international community, sport played a major unifying role between the country's diverse ethnic groups.

Naidoo and Devi Moodley Rajab, they interviewed a series of Indian South Africans about their experience in South Africa. Their study highlighted education, the workplace, and general day to day living. For one specific participant who was a doctor, said that it was considered the norm for Non-White and White doctors to mingle while working at the hospital but when there was any down time or breaks, they were to go back to their segregated quarters. Not only was there severe segregation for doctors, Non-White, more specifically Indians, were paid three to four times less than their White counterparts. Many described being treated as a \u201cthird class citizen\u201d due to the humiliation of the standard of treatment for Non-White employees across many professions. Many Indians described a sense of justified superiority from Whites due to the apartheid laws that, in the minds of White South Africans, legitimised those feelings. Another finding of this study was the psychological damage done to Indians living in South Africa during apartheid. One of the biggest long-term effects was inter-racial mistrust. Inter-racial mistrust is emotional hatred towards Whites. There was such a strong degree of alienation that left damaging psychological effects of inferiority.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/097133360501700204|title = The Dynamics of Oppression| journal=Psychology and Developing Societies| volume=17| issue=2| pages=139\u2013159|year = 2005|last1 = Naidoo|first1 = Josephine C.| last2=Rajab| first2=Devi Moodley}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese South Africans]]{{snds}}who were descendants of migrant workers who came to work in the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] around Johannesburg in the late 19th century{{snds}}were initially either classified as \"Coloured\" or \"Other Asian\" and were subject to numerous forms of discrimination and restriction.<ref name=\"Sze memoir\">{{cite book|last1=Sze |first1=Szeming |title=World War II Memoirs, 1941\u20131945 |date=2014 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |location=Pittsburgh |page=42 |edition=Digital |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=31735066261615;view=toc;c=ulstext |accessdate=7 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108030328/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=31735066261615%3Bview%3Dtoc%3Bc%3Dulstext |archivedate=8 November 2014 }}</ref> It was not until 1984 that [[Chinese South Africans|South African Chinese]], increased to about 10,000, were given the same official rights as the [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese]], to be treated as whites in terms of the Group Areas Act, although they still faced discrimination and did not receive all the benefits/rights of their newly obtained honorary white status such as voting.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[Overseas Indonesians|Indonesians]] arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as slaves until the abolishment of slavery during the 1800s.

The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action, a series of [[Strike action|strikes]], [[boycott]]s and [[civil disobedience]] actions that led to occasional violent clashes with the authorities.\n\nIn 1959, a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC), which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of those protests was held in the township of [[Sharpeville]], where 69 people were killed by police in the [[Sharpeville massacre]].\n\nIn the wake of Sharpeville, the government declared a [[state of emergency]]. More than 18,000 people were arrested, including leaders of the ANC and PAC, and both organisations were banned. The resistance went underground, with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of [[Sabotage|domestic sabotage]] and [[terrorism]].\n\nIn May 1961, before the declaration of South Africa as a Republic, an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings, threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored.\n\nWhen the government overlooked them, the strikers (among the main organisers was a 42-year-old, [[Thembu]]-origin [[Nelson Mandela]]) carried out their threats. The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938112,00.html A War Won], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 9 June 1961</ref> Defeated, the protesters called off their strike. The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures. Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961, the anniversary of the [[Battle of Blood River]].\n\nIn the 1970s, the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] (BCM) was created by [[Tertiary education|tertiary students]] influenced by the Black Power movement in the US. BCM endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system. The leader of the movement, [[Steve Biko]], was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was beaten to death in detention.\n\nIn 1976, secondary students in Soweto took to the streets in the [[Soweto uprising]] to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans as the only language of instruction. On 16 June, police opened fire on students protesting peacefully. According to official reports 23 people were killed, but the number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheid/a/Soweto-Uprising-Pt2.htm 16 June 1976 Student Uprising in Soweto]. africanhistory.about.com</ref><ref name=\"Harrison1987\">{{cite book|title=The White Tribe of Africa|year=1987|first=David|last=Harrison}}</ref><ref>([[Les Payne]] of Newsday said at least 850 murders were documented) Elsabe Brink; Gandhi Malungane; Steve Lebelo; Dumisani Ntshangase; Sue Krige, ''Soweto 16 June 1976'', 2001, 9</ref> In the following years several student organisations were formed to protest against apartheid, and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 and rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986.\n[[File:MK Attacks.JPG|thumb|left|250px|List of attacks attributed to MK and compiled by the Committee for South African War Resistance (COSAWR) between 1980 and 1983.]]\nIn parallel with student protests, labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974. After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, filling the gap left by the banning of political parties. In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining, although strikes were still illegal. Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] wrote that basic [[supply and demand]] led to violations of Apartheid \"on a massive scale\" throughout the nation, simply because there were not enough white South African business owners to meet the demand for various goods and services. Large portions of the garment industry and construction of new homes, for example, were effectively owned and operated by blacks, who either worked surreptitiously or who circumvented the law with a white person as a nominal, figurehead manager.<ref>Sowell, Thomas (2004, 2009). ''Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One''. Second Edition, NY: Basic Books. Ch. 7: The Economics of Discrimination.</ref>\n\nIn 1983, anti-apartheid leaders determined to resist the tricameral parliament assembled to form the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) in order to coordinate anti-apartheid activism inside South Africa. The first presidents of the UDF were [[Archie Gumede]], [[Oscar Mpetha]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]]; patrons were Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], Dr [[Allan Boesak]], [[Helen Joseph]], and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Basing its platform on abolishing apartheid and creating a nonracial democratic South Africa, the UDF provided a legal way for domestic human rights groups and individuals of all races to organise demonstrations and campaign against apartheid inside the country. Churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance. Church leaders were not immune to prosecution, and certain faith-based organisations were banned, but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did. The UDF, coupled with the protection of the church, accordingly permitted a major role for Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], who served both as a prominent domestic voice and international spokesperson denouncing apartheid and urging the creation of a shared nonracial state.<ref>Nelson Mandela Foundation,  [https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv03188/06lv03222.htm United Democratic Front]</ref>\n\nAlthough the majority of whites supported apartheid, some 20 percent did not. Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by [[Helen Suzman]], [[Colin Eglin]] and [[Harry Schwarz]], who formed the [[Progressive Federal Party]]. Extra-parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the [[South African Communist Party]] and women's organisation the [[Black Sash]]. Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties.\n\n== International relations during apartheid ==\n{{International opposition to Apartheid}}\n{{Main|Foreign relations of South Africa during apartheid}}\n\n=== Commonwealth ===\nSouth Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]] criticised them during his [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]] speech in [[Cape Town]]. Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the [[Sharpeville Massacre]], resulting in more international condemnation. Soon afterwards, [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] announced a [[1960 South Africa referendum|referendum]] on whether the country should become a republic. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for Whites to eighteen years of age and included Whites in [[South West Africa]] on the roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked Whites; \"Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union?\", and 52 percent voted \"Yes\".{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nAs a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], with which it had privileged trade links. [[India]] had become a [[republic within the Commonwealth]] in 1950, but it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence.\n\n=== United Nations ===\n{{quote|We stand here today to salute the United Nations Organisation and its Member States, both singly and collectively, for joining forces with the masses of our people in a common struggle that has brought about our emancipation and pushed back the frontiers of racism.| [[Nelson Mandela]], address to the United Nations as South African President, 3 October 1994<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/apartheid.shtml Nelson Mandela] United Nations</ref>}}\n\nThe apartheid system as an issue was first formally brought to the [[United Nations]] attention, in order to advocate for the Indians residing in South Africa. On June 22 of 1946, the Indian government requested that the discriminatory treatment of Indians living in South Africa be included on the agenda of the first General Assembly session.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Remarks at memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg, 10 December 2013|date=2016-12-16|doi = 10.18356/c18bc974-en}}</ref> In 1952, apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although South Africa's racial policies were a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction.<ref>Ampiah, Kweku (1997). ''The dynamics of Japan's relations with Africa: South Africa, Tanzania and Nigeria.'' CRC Press. p. 147.</ref>\n\nIn April 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed following the [[Sharpeville massacre]], and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 134|Resolution 134]] called upon the nation of South Africa to abandon its policies implementing racial discrimination. The newly founded United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, scripted and passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 181|Resolution 181]] on August 7, 1963, which called upon all states to cease the sale and shipment of all ammunition and military vehicles to South Africa. This clause, was finally declared mandatory on 4 November 1977, depriving South Africa of military aide.  From 1964 onwards, the US and the UK discontinued their [[Arms industry|arms trade]] with South Africa. The Security Council also condemned the Soweto massacre in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 392|Resolution 392]]. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|Resolution 418]]. In addition to isolating South Africa militarily, the United Nations General Assembly, encouraged the boycotting of oil sales to South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Remarks at memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg, 10 December 2013|date=2016-12-16|doi = 10.18356/c18bc974-en}}</ref> Other actions taken by the United Nations General Assembly include the request for all nations and organisations, \u201cto suspend cultural, educational, sporting and other exchanges with the racist regime and with organisations or institutions in South Africa which practice apartheid\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Remarks at memorial ceremony for Nelson Mandela, Johannesburg, 10 December 2013|date=2016-12-16|doi = 10.18356/c18bc974-en}}</ref> Illustrating that over a long period of time, the United Nations was working towards isolating the state of South Africa, by putting pressure on the Apartheid regime.\n\nAfter much debate, by the late-1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A [[disinvestment from South Africa]] movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/guide/antia.htm|title=Summary of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|publisher=[[United States Congress]]|accessdate=22 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722054047/http://actrav.itcilo.org/actrav-english/telearn/global/ilo/guide/antia.htm|archive-date=22 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Catholic Church ===\n[[Pope John Paul II]] was an outspoken opponent of apartheid.

''Introduction to African politics: a continental approach.'' Praeger. p. 128.</ref>\n\nSouth Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to its policies brought about another OAU announcement in October 1971. The ''Mogadishu Declaration'' stated that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that its Black people could only be freed through military means, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government.<ref>Klotz, Audie (1999).

He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's isolation and to revitalise the country's global reputation, even those with Black majority rule in Africa. This he called his \"Outward-Looking\" policy.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Pfister|first=Roger |title=Apartheid South Africa and African States: From Pariah to Middle Power, 1962\u20131994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YABvZRghzkAC&pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-85043-625-6|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Beck|first=Roger B. |title=The History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313307300|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313307300/page/151 151]|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30730-0|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ndlovu|first=Sifiso Mxolisi|title=The Road to Democracy in South Africa: 1970\u20131980|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGE-XB5QlD8C&pg=PA616|volume=2|year=2004|publisher=Unisa Press|isbn=978-1-86888-406-3|chapter=The ANC's Diplomacy and International Relations}}</ref>\n\nVorster's willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd's refusal to engage with leaders such as [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] of [[Nigeria]] in 1962 and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of [[Zambia]] in 1964. In 1966, he met the heads of the neighbouring states of [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Botswana]]. In 1967, he offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that no political strings were attached, aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa's racial policies. Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working down the South African mines. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid, but were dependent on South African economic assistance.\n\n[[Malawi]] was the first not-neighbouring country to accept South African aid. In 1967, the two states set out their political and economic relations. In 1969, Malawi was the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto condemning South Africa' apartheid policy. In 1970, Malawian president [[Hastings Banda]] made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa.\n\nAssociations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]], Madagascar, [[Mauritius]], Gabon, [[Zaire]] (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the [[Central African Republic]]. Although these states condemned apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), South Africa's economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees{{clarify|date=September 2014}}.\n\n=== Sports and culture ===\n{{Main|Sporting boycott of South Africa|Rugby union and apartheid}}\n\n====Beginning====\nSouth Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of them having players of different races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] severed its ties with the all-White South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.\n\n====Isolation====\n\n====Verwoerd years====\nIn 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with White establishments, SASA approached the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, they would be barred from competing at the [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games]] in [[Tokyo]]. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Olympic Games. South Africa selected a multi-racial team for the next Olympic Games, and the IOC opted for incorporation in the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympic Games]]. Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation.\n\nForeign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa, until the 1970 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour allowed [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] to enter the country under the status of \"honorary Whites\". Huge and widespread protests occurred in [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|New Zealand in 1981]] against the [[Springboks|Springbok]] tour{{snds}}the government spent $8,000,000 protecting games using the army and police force. A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protesters and it was cancelled. A \"rebel tour\"{{snds}}not government sanctioned{{snds}}went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.<ref>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour The 1981 Springbok rugby tour{{snds}}A country divided]. New Zealand History Online.</ref>\n\n=====Vorster years=====\nOn 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was fatally stabbed at Parliament House by parliamentary messenger [[Dimitri Tsafendas]], who was arrested and quickly imprisoned. [[John Vorster]] took office shortly after, and announced that South Africa would no longer dictate to the international community what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for international sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. \"Dolly\" was eventually included in the team as the first substitute, but the tour was cancelled. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, including that of an England rugby team touring South Africa in 1969/70.\n\nThe first of the \"White Bans\" occurred in 1971 when the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing Association{{snds}}[[Don Bradman|Sir Don Bradman]]{{snds}}flew to South Africa to meet Vorster. Vorster had expected Bradman to allow the tour of the Australian cricket team to go ahead, but things became heated after Bradman asked why Black sportsmen were not allowed to play cricket. Vorster stated that Blacks were intellectually inferior and had no finesse for the game. Bradman{{snds}}thinking this ignorant and repugnant{{snds}}asked Vorster if he had heard of a man named [[Garry Sobers]]. On his return to [[Australia]], Bradman released a short statement: \"We will not play them until they choose a team on a non-racist basis.\"<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/the-day-apartheid-was-hit-for-six/2008/08/22/1219262525329.html The Day Apartheid Was Hit For Six]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''.</ref>  Bradman's views were in stark contrast to those of Australian tennis great [[Margaret Court]], who had won the [[grand slam (tennis)|grand slam]] the previous year and commented about apartheid that \"South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America\" and that she would \"go back there any time.\"<ref>{{cite news|title = Margaret Court: astounding champion who found God and lost the respect of a nation|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/03/margaret-court-astounding-champion-who-found-god-and-lost-the-respect-of-a-nation|work = [[Guardian Australia]]|first = Russell|last = Jackson|accessdate = 7 November 2019|date = 3 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn South Africa, Vorster vented his anger publicly against Bradman, while the African National Congress rejoiced. This was the first time a predominantly White nation had taken the side of multiracial sport, producing an unsettling resonance that more \"White\" boycotts were coming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamcricket.com/community/blogs/cover_points/archive/2008/08/23/bradman-s-perfection.aspx |title=Bradman's Perfection |publisher=DreamCricket |accessdate=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710151045/http://www.dreamcricket.com/community/blogs/cover_points/archive/2008/08/23/bradman-s-perfection.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nAlmost twenty years later, on his release from prison, Nelson Mandela asked a visiting Australian statesman if Donald Bradman, his childhood hero, was still alive (Bradman lived until 2001).\n\nIn 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations.\n\nIn [[1978 Commonwealth Games|1978]], Nigeria [[boycott]]ed the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]]. Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] because of UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://experts.about.com/e/c/co/Commonwealth_Games.htm|title=Commonwealth Games|publisher=About.com|accessdate=7 February 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060527215130/http://experts.about.com/e/c/co/Commonwealth_Games.htm| archivedate=27 May 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Cultural boycott====\nIn the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for ''cultural'' boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor [[Marlon Brando]] called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in the United Kingdom and the United States was also vetoed.{{by whom|date=December 2018}} After the arrival of [[TV|television]] in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union, [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Similarly, when [[home video]] grew popular in the 1980s, the Australian arm of [[CBS/Fox Video]] (now [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]) placed stickers on their [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] cassettes which labeled exporting such cassettes to South Africa as \"an infringement of copyright\".<ref>https://vhscollector.com/sites/default/files/vhs/domino-principal-vhs-5-29047.jpg</ref> Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions,{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid.\n\n=== Western influence ===\n[[File:Boycott Apartheid Bus, London, UK. 1989.jpg|thumb|London \"Boycott Apartheid\" bus, 1989]]\nWhile international opposition to apartheid grew, the [[Nordic countries]]{{snds}}and [[Sweden]] in particular{{snds}}provided both moral and financial support for the [[African National Congress|ANC]].<ref>International Labour Office (1991).

It set up a powerful [[State Security Council|state security apparatus]] to \"protect\" the state against an anticipated upsurge in [[political violence]] that the reforms were expected to trigger. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as [[Counterintelligence state|securocrats]]), who managed the various States of Emergencies.<ref>Fox, William; Fourie, Marius; Van Wyk, Belinda (1998). ''Police Management in South Africa.'' Juta and Company Limited. p. 167.</ref>\n\nBotha's years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa, as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate [[SWAPO]] in Namibia. Within South Africa, meanwhile, vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans, and an effective end to the African National Congress' sabotage campaign.\n\nThe government punished political offenders brutally. 40,000 people annually were subjected to [[Flagellation|whipping]] as a form of punishment.<ref>Anzovin, Steven (1987).

Led by the [[Reverend]] [[Allan Boesak]] and [[Albertina Sisulu]], the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish the apartheid system and eliminate the homelands completely.\n\n=== State of emergency ===\nSerious political violence was a prominent feature from 1985\u201389, as Black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti-apartheid organisations and the Botha government. Throughout the 1980s, township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities. The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders, who were seen to be supporting the government. By 1985, it had become the ANC's aim to make Black townships \"ungovernable\" (a term later replaced by \"people's power\") by means of rent boycotts and other militant action. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. People's courts were set up, and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishments. Black town councillors and policemen, and sometimes their families, were attacked with petrol bombs, beaten, and murdered by [[necklacing]], where a burning tyre was placed around the victim's neck, after they were restrained by wrapping their wrists with barbed wire. This signature act of torture and murder was embraced by the ANC and its leaders.\n\nOn 20 July 1985, Botha declared a [[State of Emergency]] in 36 magisterial districts. Areas affected were the [[Eastern Cape]], and the [[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging|PWV]] region (\"[[Pretoria]], [[Witwatersrand]], [[Vereeniging]]\").<ref>Pomeroy, William J. (1986). ''Apartheid, imperialism, and African freedom.'' International Publishers. p. 226. {{ISBN|978-0-7178-0640-9}}.</ref> Three months later, the [[Western Cape]] was included. An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed (restricted in some way); many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them. During this state of emergency, about 2,436 people were detained under the [[Internal Security Act, 1982|Internal Security Act]].<ref>Legum, Colin (1989). ''Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents, Volume 20.'' Africana Pub. Co. p. 668.</ref>  This act gave police and the military sweeping powers. The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people. The president could [[rule by decree]] without referring to the constitution or to parliament. It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening, to advise anyone to stay away from work or to oppose the government, and to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government released that name, with up to ten years' imprisonment for these offences. [[Indefinite detention|Detention without trial]] became a common feature of the government's reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988, 30,000 people had been detained.<ref>McKendrick, Brian; Hoffmann, Wilman (1990).

Oxford University Press. p. 62.</ref> The media was [[Censorship|censored]], thousands were arrested and many were [[Interrogation|interrogated]] and [[torture]]d.<ref>Blond, Rebecca; Fitzpatrick, Mary (2004). ''South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland.'' Lonely Planet. p. 40.</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1986, four days before the tenth anniversary of the Soweto uprising, the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country. The government amended the Public Security Act, including the right to declare \"unrest\" areas, allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas. Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government's strategy and [[Professional video camera|television cameras]] were banned from entering such areas. The [[State media|state broadcaster]], the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC), provided propaganda in support of the government. Media opposition to the system increased, supported by the growth of a pro-ANC [[underground press]] within South Africa.\n\nIn 1987, the State of Emergency was extended for another two years. Meanwhile, about 200,000 members of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (South Africa)|National Union of Mineworkers]] commenced the longest strike (three weeks) in South African history. The year 1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti-apartheid organisations.\n\nMuch of the violence in the late-1980s and early-1990s was directed at the government, but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves. Many died in violence between members of [[Inkatha Freedom Party|Inkatha]] and the UDF-ANC faction. It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other whenever it suited them. Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad; they undertook cross-border army and air-force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases. The ANC and the PAC in return detonated bombs at restaurants, shopping centres and government buildings such as [[Magistrates' court|magistrates courts]]. Between 1960\u20131994, according to statistics from the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] was responsible for 4,500 deaths, South African security forces were responsible for 2,700 deaths and the ANC was responsible for 1,300 deaths.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/Volume5.pdf Volume Five \u2013 Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report]</ref>\n\nThe state of emergency continued until 1990, when it was lifted by State President [[F.W. de Klerk]].\n\n== Final years of apartheid ==\n{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}\n\n=== Factors ===\n\n==== Institutional racism ====\nApartheid developed from the racism of colonial factions and due to South Africa's \"unique industrialisation\".<ref name=\"NigelWorden\">Nigel, Worden, The making of modern South Africa: Conquest, Segregation and Apartheid, 3rd ed.

South African troops withdrew from Angola early in 1976, failing to prevent the [[MPLA]] from gaining power there, and Black students in South Africa celebrated.\n\nThe [[Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]], signed by [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] and [[Harry Schwarz]] in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]]. It caused a split in the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] that ultimately realigned oppositional politics in South Africa with the formation of the [[Progressive Federal Party]] in 1977. The Declaration was the first of several such joint agreements by acknowledged Black and White political leaders in South Africa.\n\nIn 1978, the National Party Defence Minister, [[Pieter Willem Botha]], became Prime Minister. His white minority regime worried about Soviet aid to revolutionaries in South Africa at the same time that South African economic growth had slowed. The South African Government noted that it was spending too much money to maintain segregated homelands created for Blacks, and the homelands were proving to be uneconomical.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nNor was maintaining Blacks as third-class citizens working well. Black labour remained vital to the economy, and illegal Black labour unions were flourishing. Many Blacks remained too poor to contribute significantly to the economy through their purchasing power{{snds}}although they composed  more than 70% of the population. Botha's regime feared that an antidote was needed to prevent the Blacks' being attracted to Communism.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Democratization in South Africa|last = Giliomee|first = Hermann|date = 1995|journal = Political Science Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nIn July 1979, the Nigerian Government alleged that the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) was selling Nigerian oil to South Africa, though there was little evidence or commercial logic for such sales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weymouth Genova|first=Ann |title=Oil and Nationalism in Nigeria, 1970\u20131980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T3NVGzBmkUC&pg=PA123|accessdate=11 April 2012|year=2007|isbn=978-0-549-26666-2|page=123}} Weymouth Genova covers the possibility of Nigerian oil going to South Africa in detail from page 113.

The government allowed Mandela more visitors, including visits and interviews by foreigners, to let the world know that he was being treated well.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nBlack homelands were declared [[nation-state]]s and [[pass laws]] were abolished. Black labour unions were legitimised, the government recognised the right of Blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave Blacks [[property rights]] there. Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sexual relations between different races, which was under ridicule abroad. The spending for Black schools increased, to one-seventh of what was spent per White child, up from on one-sixteenth in 1968. At the same time, attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus.\n\nIn January 1985, Botha addressed the government's House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives. Mandela's reply was read in public by his daughter Zinzi{{snds}}his first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty-one years before. Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence. The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants. This response helped to further elevate Mandela's status in the eyes of those, both internationally and domestically, who opposed apartheid.\n\nBetween 1986\u201388, some petty apartheid laws were repealed, along with the pass laws.<ref name=\"saHistoryPassLaws\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=21 March 2011|work=South African History Online|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> Botha told [[White South Africans]] to \"adapt or die\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916936,00.html South Africa: Adapt or Die]. ''Time''.</ref> and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as \"[[Point of no return|rubicon]]\" announcements of substantial reforms, although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes. Ironically, these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the 1980s as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement. Botha's government stopped short of substantial reforms, such as lifting the ban on the ANC, PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations, releasing political prisoners, or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid. The government's stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations \"renounced violence\".\n\nBy 1987, South Africa's economy was growing at one of the lowest rates in the world, and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many Whites in South Africa. Examples of African states with Black leaders and White minorities existed in [[Kenya]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. Whispers of South Africa one day having a Black President sent more hardline Whites into supporting right-wing political parties. Mandela was moved to a four-bedroom house of his own, with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees, on a prison farm just outside of Cape Town. He had an unpublicised meeting with Botha. Botha impressed Mandela by walking forward, extending his hand and pouring Mandela's tea. The two had a friendly discussion, with Mandela comparing the African National Congress' rebellion with that of the [[Afrikaner rebellion]] and talking about everyone being brothers.\n\nA number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC-in-exile and various sectors of the internal struggle, such as women and educationalists. More overtly, a group of White intellectuals met the ANC in [[Senegal]] for talks known as the [[Dakar Conference]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberfeld | first1 = Daniel | year = 2002 | title = Evaluating the Contributions of Track-two Diplomacy to Conflict Termination in South Africa, 1984\u201390 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2cb14e2f301357410bdbe2710c5899b992e41d4| journal = Journal of Peace Research | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 355\u2013372 | doi = 10.1177/0022343302039003006 }}</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of F.

Despite his initial reputation as a conservative, de Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country. Prior to his term in office, F.W De Klerk had already experienced political success as a result of the power base he had built in the Transvaal. During this time, F.W De Klerk served as chairman to the provincial National Party, which was in favor of the Apartheid regime. The transition of de Klerk's ideology regarding apartheid is seen clearly in his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990. F.W de Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]]. The Land Act was brought to an end. De Klerk also made his first public commitment to release Nelson Mandela, to return to [[press freedom]] and to suspend the death penalty. Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of [[common law]] crimes were released.\n\nOn 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from [[Victor Verster Prison]] after more than 27 years behind bars.\n\nHaving been instructed by the [[UN Security Council]] to end its long-standing involvement in South West Africa/[[Namibia]], and in the face of military stalemate in Southern Angola, and an escalation in the size and cost of the combat with the Cubans, the Angolans, and SWAPO forces and the growing cost of the border war, South Africa negotiated a change of control; [[Namibia]] became independent on 21 March 1990.\n\n=== Negotiations ===\n{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}\nApartheid was dismantled in a series of [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiations]] from 1990\u201391, culminating in a transitional period which resulted in the country's [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]], the first in South Africa held with [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1990, negotiations were earnestly begun, with two meetings between the government and the ANC. The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition towards majority rule. These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations, despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country. Apartheid legislation was abolished in 1991.<ref name=\"Abolished\"/>\n\nAt the first meeting, the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin. The meeting was held at [[Groote Schuur]], the President's official residence. They released the Groote Schuur Minute, which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return.\n\nThere were fears that the change of power would be violent. To avoid this, it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached. In December 1991, the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|Convention for a Democratic South Africa]] (CODESA) began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial [[Provisional government|transitional government]] and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups. CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an \"undivided South Africa\".\n\nReforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] White opposition, leading to the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] winning a number of by-elections against NP candidates. De Klerk responded by calling a Whites-only [[1992 South African Referendum|referendum]] in March 1992 to decide whether negotiations should continue. 68% voted in favour, and the victory instilled in de Klerk and the government a lot more confidence, giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations.\n\nWhen negotiations resumed in May 1992, under the tag of CODESA II, stronger demands were made. The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy. The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government, and the power to change decisions made by parliament.\n\nPersistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations. This was due mostly to the intense rivalry between the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] (IFP) and the ANC and the eruption of some traditional tribal and local rivalries between the Zulu and Xhosa historical tribal affinities, especially in the Southern Natal provinces. Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences, they could not stem the violence. One of the worst cases of ANC-IFP violence was the [[Boipatong massacre]] of 17 June 1992, when 200 IFP militants attacked the [[Gauteng]] township of [[Boipatong]], killing 45. Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles, supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence. Subsequent judicial inquiries found the evidence of the witnesses to be unreliable or discredited, and that there was no evidence of National Party or police involvement in the massacre.  When de Klerk visited the scene of the incident he was initially warmly welcomed, but he was suddenly confronted by a crowd of protesters brandishing stones and placards.  The motorcade sped from the scene as police tried to hold back the crowd.  Shots were fired by the police, and the PAC stated that three of its supporters had been gunned down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975920-1,00.html|work=Time |title=Enemies: Black vs. Black vs. White|first=Scott|last=Macleod|date=7 July 1992}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Boipatong massacre offered the ANC a pretext to engage in brinkmanship.  Mandela argued that de Klerk, as head of state, was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed. He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC-IFP violence. This formed the basis for ANC's withdrawal from the negotiations, and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage.\n\nThe [[Bisho massacre]] on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head. The [[Ciskei Defence Force]] killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the [[Ciskei]] homeland into South Africa. In the aftermath, Mandela and de Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence. This led to a resumption of negotiations.\n\nRight-wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period. The assassination of [[Chris Hani]] on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos. Hani, the popular General Secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), was assassinated in 1993 in [[Dawn Park]] in [[Johannesburg]] by [[Janusz Walu\u015b]], an [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] [[Poles|Polish]] refugee who had close links to the White nationalist [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB). Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela; his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the [[international community]], but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination.<ref name=turningpoints>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm |title=Turning Points in History Book 6: Negotiation, Transition and Freedom |accessdate=3 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309124114/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm |archivedate=9 March 2008 }}</ref> On 25 June 1993, the AWB used an armoured vehicle to [[Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre|crash through the doors]] of the [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council, though this did not derail the process.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn addition to the continuing \"black-on-black\" violence, there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC's military wing, the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA). The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry, impatient youth. In the [[St James Church massacre]] on 25 July 1993, members of the APLA opened fire in a church in Cape Town, killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58.\n\nIn 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] \"for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1993|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1993|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=27 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060620040422/http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1993/| archivedate=20 June 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nViolence persisted right up to the 1994 general election. [[Lucas Mangope]], leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, declared that it would not take part in the elections. It had been decided that, once the temporary constitution had come into effect, the homelands would be incorporated into South Africa, but Mangope did not want this to happen. There were strong protests against his decision, leading to a [[Bophuthatswana coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat in Bophuthatswana]] on 10 March that deposed Mangope, despite the intervention of white right-wingers hoping to maintain him in power.

J. Williams (politician)|D. J. Williams]].  Williams was a member of [[Pontardawe]] [[Rural District Council]], and the Executive Council of the [[South Wales Miners' Federation]].  He had been part of a miners' delegation to the [[Soviet Union]] and was known for his opposition to [[Welsh nationalism]].<ref>M. Stenton and S.

The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), which had considerable strength in South Wales, was not a signatory to the pact, but had undertaken not to contest seats held by the major parties.  As a result, the only opposition in by-elections came from [[independent (politician)|independent]]s, minor parties and occasional unofficial party candidates aligned with major parties.\n\n[[Plaid Cymru]] stood [[Wynne Samuel]], its South Wales organiser.  The party's main strengths were in North Wales, and he was not expected to be a strong contender, but the party hoped this would launch a new strategy of winning over industrial workers in the south of the nation.<ref>\"Elections Test Future of Welsh Party\", ''[[The Observer]]'', 11 February 1945</ref>\n\nThe [[Trotskyist]] [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1944)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP) stood [[Jock Haston]], its General Secretary.  This was the first time any Trotskyist organisation had stood a candidate in a British Parliamentary election.<ref name=\"appeal\">\"[http://www.socialist.net/britain-1945-trotskyism150405.htm Trotskyism in May 1945: Down with the Churchill Coalition!

Several local miners' lodges had supported their defence, and the RCP had sent a prominent member, [[John Lawrence (political activist)|John Lawrence]], as a full-time organiser for the area, recruiting some activists in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], [[Llanelli]] and [[Swansea]].<ref name=\"war\" />\n\nThe party stood on a [[revolutionary]] [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] platform, declaring \"Our candidate will fight on a platform of uncompromising hostility to the imperialist war, for the breaking of the Coalition, for the overthrow of the Churchill Government and for Labour to take power on a Socialist platform.\"<ref name=\"appeal\" /> Their main slogan was \"Break the Coalition, Labour to Power\".<ref name=\"war\" />\n\n==Campaign==\nThe Communist Party offered its full support to the Labour candidate and campaigned against the RCP, using the slogan \"A Vote for Haston is a Vote for Hitler\".  Williams repudiated the Communist support, opposing its policy of a [[popular front]] with the Conservatives and Labour after the war.<ref name=\"war\" />\n\nAfter repeated requests from the RCP, the CPGB agreed to hold a debate in Neath, putting up Alun Thomas, leader of the Communist Party in West Wales, against Haston.  The meeting attracted about 1,500 voters, who heard Thomas claim that \"In Russia they defeated fascism because they shot all the Trotskyists and the Fifth column scum, and if we had our way, these people on this platform would be shot.\"<ref name=\"appeal\" />\n\nThe local [[Independent Labour Party]] was small, and was split as to how to respond to the election.  Two of their local activists campaigned for and subsequently joined the RCP.<ref>[[Jim Higgins (British politician)|Jim Higgins]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/higgins/1963/xx/10years.htm Ten Years for the Locust]</ref>\n\nIn the final week of the campaign, the war in Europe was concluded and [[VE Day]] was held, overshadowing the by-election.<ref name=\"polling\" /> Although it was apparent that Labour would not agree to continue the coalition and would compel Churchill to call a [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]], the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' called on all Conservative and Liberal supporters to vote for Williams.<ref name=\"war\" />\n\n==Results==\nWilliams retained the seat for Labour with a large majority, and held it until his retirement at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]].
