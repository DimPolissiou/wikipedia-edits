The film's lead is played by [[Georgia Groome]], with [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] and [[Karen Taylor (comedian)|Karen Taylor]] amongst the supporting cast. The story is based on two teenage novels by [[Louise Rennison]]: ''[[Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging]]'' and ''[[It's OK, I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers]]''. The narrative follows fourteen-year-old Georgia Nicholson (Groome) as she tries to find a boyfriend while also organising her fifteenth birthday party. This is the first film from Nickelodeon that was rated PG-13.\n\n==Plot==\nGeorgia Nicholson is a 14 year old girl from [[Eastbourne]] who worries about her looks, is embarrassed by her mum Connie, dad Bob, and mad little sister Libby, and fears she will never get a boyfriend. One day, she humiliates herself by going to a cool party in a ridiculously oversized [[olive]] costume. She had agreed with her three friends to go to the party as hors-d'\u0153uvres as a joke and to be original, but her friends decided to wear other costumes because 'boys don't like them for being funny'. This causes people to laugh at her, especially popular schoolbully Lindsay. Georgia leaves the party and runs home, attracting looks from people.\n\nOn the first day of the new school term, Georgia and her friends, Jas, Ellen and Rosie, known as her \"Ace Gang\", spot two new brothers that have just moved to Eastbourne from London, [[fraternal twins]] Robbie and Tom. The girls follow the boys, who are exploring town with their friend Dave \"the Laugh\".\n\nGeorgia  and Jas then hatch a plan to get close to the brothers and visit them in their mothers organic foodshop where they work. Jas is quickly enamored with Tom and Georgia strikes up a conversation with Robbie, until her mother walks in and embarrasses her. Jas convinces her not to give up, but then discover Robbie is already dating Lindsay. Realizing that Robbie likes cats, Georgia comes up with a new plan. She pretends her cat, Angus, has gone missing and asks Robbie to help her find him. Jas has Angus on a leash in the park, but he escapes and Tom rescues him just as Georgia and Robbie arrive. Robbie leaves to spend time with Lindsay and Tom asks Jas on a date, after which they become a couple.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Georgia's father has been offered a job in New Zealand, and he goes while his family stays behind. During his absence, Georgia's mum hires a handsome builder called Jem to re-do the living room, and begins to spend increasingly longer periods of time with him, even going to dance-classes with him, making Georgia worried as to the state of her parents' marriage.\n\nIn an attempt to \"grow up\" for Robbie, Georgia then goes to have \"snogging lessons\" with Peter Dyer. He becomes infatuated with her and at a party the following night, he tries to kiss her, causing her to fall in to a bush and expose her underwear to Robbie, Lindsay, Jas and Tom, who see her on the ground with Peter. In order to get away from Peter, Georgia tells him that she is a lesbian. Tom invites Jas  to go swimming with him and Robbie. Georgia conspires to meet them at the pool and brings her sister along as she is stuck babysitting her. While in the pool Robbie and Georgia kiss. Robbie then leaves, claiming that he has to \"sort some things out\" but that he will phone Georgia later.\n\nAfter not hearing from Robbie in a while, Georgia is heartbroken. Her mum gives her a book 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'. Georgia reads it and decides she has to make Robbie jealous to realize his feelings for her. She asks Dave the Laugh to a gig for Robbie's band, the [[Stiff Dylans]]. Robbie sees Georgia and Dylan dancing and laughing and tries to talk to her, but is stopped by Lindsay. \n\nAt school, Dave finds out that Georgia was only using him to make Robbie jealous and so stops talking to her. When Dave tells Robbie that Georgia was only using him, he stops talking to her as well. When she finds out it was Jas that accidentally leaked this information, they have an argument and Georgia kicks Jas in the shin. They vow never to speak to each other again and then Robbie tells her of his disappointment in her. He says he wanted to break up with Lindsay before anything else happened between them, but now he is disappointed with her behavior.  \n\nFeeling like there is no point in staying in England, Georgia decides that she would like to move to New Zealand. She goes to her father employer and breaks down with a woman who works with hem, telling her she doesn't want her family to be away from each other. Before she leaves she goes to the beach for a walk knowing Robbie would be there and apologizes to him. Robbie tells her that he dumped Lindsay and he admits that he still likes her. \n\nOn the morning of her birthday, Georgia's mother tells her they are going to a club for the first time. When they arrive, the place seems pretty dead but it turns out to be a surprise fifteenth birthday party, which Jas had secretly organized with Georgia's mother. It is at a new club, outnumbering Lindsay's party. She is greeted by all her friends and her family, with Jas and Georgia befriending each other again. As a surprise, Georgia's father returns from New Zealand, deciding to stay in Eastbourne for a better job opportunity, after his boss told him about Georgia's breakdown. It is also revealed that Jem is gay, and that his boyfriend is the owner of the nightclub. The Stiff Dylans are performing the song \"[[This Crazy Life|Ultraviolet]]\" which Robbie had written about Georgia, when they are interrupted by Lindsay who had come from her own party (to which no-one had turned up) and tells Robbie that he would either have to take her back or lose her forever. He tells her that Georgia is the one he wants, and he kisses Georgia on-stage. Jas then stuffs her hands into Lindsay's breasts and pulls out her breast pads. She tosses them into the crowd, and furiously, Lindsay storms off the stage.\n\nIn the final scene, Georgia is content with how she looks and with her crazy family. As she meets Robbie to walk to school together, she also comments that she found a boyfriend who thinks she is perfect.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Georgia Groome]] as Georgia Nicolson: The main character, a 14-year-old girl who falls in love with Robbie and tries to get him to be her boyfriend throughout the film.\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] as Robbie Jennings: Georgia's love interest, he is in a band called The Stiff Dylans, and is initially Lindsay's boyfriend at the beginning.\n* [[Karen Taylor (comedian)|Karen Taylor]] as Connie Nicolson: Georgia's mum, she is 'old-fashioned', and scares Georgia as it seems she gets very close to Jem, but also attempts to maintains a close relationship with her daughter.\n* [[Alan Davies]] as Bob Nicolson: Georgia's loving dad, who is a bit 'old-fashioned' too, as he does not want Georgia to have a party in a club for her birthday.

She loves to sing and dance. She tells Mehnga that she wanted to fall in love and marry, but instead married as per her family's wishes. She asks him to pretend that they are strangers so that she can fulfill her fantasy now. Mehnga agrees even though he is clueless as to how to woo a girl. They play this game and happily live their life.\n\nLaachi gets a chance to sing a song and make some money. Due to financial difficulties, she ends up singing and dancing with family's approval.  During that time, a famous singer Ajitpal Singh sees Laachi and signs her up with him. His management company gets Laachi and Mehnga to sign a document that they are single so that Laachi-Ajitpal duo can become more famous. Laachi is star-struck by Ajitpal and agrees with whatever he suggests. Ajitpal is infatuated with Laachi and tries to separate husband-wife by creating distance between them. Mehnga leaves Laachi and comes back to his village due to some misunderstandings.

The agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, olive oil, vegetables, fruits and dairy products. Traditional products are [[Lathyrus sativus|Grass Pea (cicerchia)]] and [[Farro]]. Molise's autochthonous grape is [[Tintilia]] which has been rediscovered during the last ten years, and many other PDO (DOP) wines, both red and white.\n\nThough there is a large [[Fiat]] plant ([[Termoli]]), the industrial sector is dominated by the farming industry with small and medium-sized farms spread widely throughout the region. Another important industry is food processing: pasta, meat, milk products, oil and wine are the traditional products of the region. In the services sector the most important industries are distribution, hotels and catering, followed by transport and communications, banking and insurance. With few exceptions, in all sectors firms are small, and this explains the difficulties encountered when marketing products on a national scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf2_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=2009-05-05 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721131845/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf2_eco.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\nInternational tourism is growing largely as a result of the recent opening of international flights from other European countries to [[Abruzzo Airport|Pescara Airport]], which is not far to the north in Abruzzo and connected to Molise by the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14 highway]] (the only highway passing through Molise, by Termoli).\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |355000\n|1871 |374000\n|1881 |382000\n|1901 |395000\n|1911 |396000\n|1921 |383000\n|1931 |377000\n|1936 |388000\n|1951 |407000\n|1961 |358000\n|1971 |320000\n|1981 |328000\n|1991 |331000\n|2001 |321000\n|2010 (Est.)\n      |319000\n|2017 |310449\n}}\n\nThe density of the population in Molise is well below the national average.

Negative net migration persisted until 1981.

From 1982 to 1994, net migration has been positive, then followed by a negative trend until 2001. Between 1991 (330,900 inhabitants) and 2001 (320,601 inhabitants), the population of the region decreased by 3.1%;<ref name=\"regportraits1\"/> since 2001 the population remained stable.\n\nThe region is home to two main ethnic minorities: the [[Molise Croats|Molisan Croats]] (20,000 people who speak an old Dalmatian dialect of the Croatian language alongside Italian), and those who speak the \"[[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|arbereshe]]\" dialect of Albanian in five towns of \"basso Molise\" in the province of Campobasso.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Molise}}\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nMolise comprises two provinces:\n\n[[File:Map of region of Molise, Italy, with provinces-it.svg|350px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Province\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Area (km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Population\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Density (inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n| [[Province of Campobasso]]\n| 2,909\n| 231,921\n| 79.7\n|-\n| [[Province of Isernia]]\n| 1,529\n| 88,931\n| 58.2\n|}\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|List of museums in Molise}}\nMolise has much tradition from the religious to the pagans, many museum, archeological sites, musical and food events.\n\n''Tradition''\n* The Festival dei Misteri in [[Campobasso]] (Corpus Domini)\n* Feast of Saint Pardo with ox chariot (cart) in [[Larino]] (25-26-27/May)\n* Ox chariots (La Carrese) and feast of Saint Leo in [[San Martino in Pensilis]] (30 April and 2 May)\n* The [[Ndocciata]] of [[Agnone]] (8-24/December)\n* The Saint Basso feast in [[Termoli]] with procession of boats on the sea (4 August)\n* \"U lut'm sab't d'April\" of [[Santa Croce di Magliano]] with benediction of animals (Last Saturday of April)\n* Procession of Good Friday in [[Campobasso]]\n* The procession of hooded on the Good Friday at [[Isernia]]\n* The fire of Saint Anthony the Abbot in [[Colletorto]] (17 January)\n* The feast of Saint Nicandro in [[Venafro]] (17 June)\n* The ox chariots and feast in the village of [[Ururi]] and [[Portocannone]]\n* The feast of San Biagio in [[San Biase]] (3 February), with the traditional game of the ''Morra'' and the distribution of Bread to all the inhabitants\n\n''Arts, musical and food festivals''\n* The international bagpipe festival of [[Scapoli]] in July\n* The \"Pezzata\" of [[Capracotta]] the first Sunday of August\n* The fish festival of [[Termoli]] in August\n* The Staffoli Horses in August close [[Agnone]]\n* The grape feast of [[Riccia]] in September\n* The grain feast of [[Jelsi]] on 26 July\n* The international festival of folk in the [[Matese]] in [[San Massimo]]\n* The exhibition of black truffle in [[San Pietro Avellana]]\n* The carnival of [[Larino]] in February\n* \"Gl' Cierv\" in the carnival of [[Rocchetta a Volturno|Castelnuovo del Volturno]] the last Sunday of February\n\n''Museums''\n* National museum of paleolithic in [[Isernia]]\n* Monumental complex and museum of Santa Maria delle Monache in [[Isernia]]\n* Museum of \"Tombolo\" in [[Isernia]]\n* Provincial museum of [[Samnium]] in [[Campobasso]]\n* Museum of [[Zampogna]] (Bagpipe) in [[Scapoli]]\n* Antiquarium of [[Saepinum|Saepinum-Altilia]] in [[Sepino]]\n* Photographic museum \"[[Tony Vaccaro]]\" in [[Bonefro]]\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Pasta e fagioli rapida.jpg|thumb|''[[Pasta e fagioli]]'']]\nThe cuisine of Molise is similar to the [[Abruzzo#Cuisine|cuisine of Abruzzo]], though there are some differences in the dishes and ingredients.  The flavors of Molise are dominated by the many aromatic [[herb]]s that grow there. Some of the characteristic foods include spicy [[salami]], a variety of locally produced [[cheese]]s, dishes using [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[goat meat|goat]], [[pasta]] dishes with hearty sauces, and vegetables that grow in the region.\n\nIn addition to [[bruschetta]], a typical [[antipasto]]  will consist of any of several meat dishes, such as the sausages [[capocollo]], the [[fennel]]-seasoned salsiccie al finocchio, [[soppressata]], [[ventricina]], frascateglie or sanguinaccio. In addition to these sausages, a variety of [[ham]] is available, such as smoked [[prosciutto]].  Frequently, the sausages are enjoyed with [[polenta]].\n\nMain dishes of the region include:\n*'' Brodosini'' made of [[tagliatelle]] in broth with pork cheek and fat\n* ''Calcioni di ricotta'', a specialty of [[Campobasso]], made of fried pasta stuffed with [[ricotta]], [[provolone]], prosciutto, and [[parsley]], and usually served with fried [[artichoke]]s, [[cauliflower]], [[brain (food)|brains]], [[sweetbread]], potato [[croquette]], and [[scamorza]] cheese\n* ''Cavatiegl e Patane'', or [[gnocchi]] served in a meat sauce of rabbit and pork.\n* A variety of pasta such as [[cavatelli]], [[lasagna]], or [[macaroni|maccheroni]] served with a [[rag\u00f9]] of lamb or goat\n* ''[[Pasta e fagioli]]'', pasta-and-white-bean soup cooked with pig's feet and pork rinds\n* ''Polenta d'iragn'', a polenta-like dish actually made of wheat and potatoes, sauced with raw tomatoes and pecorino\n* ''Risotto alla marinara'', a [[risotto]] with seafood\n* ''Spaghetti with diavolillo'', a strong chili pepper sauce\n* ''Zuppa di cardi'', a soup of [[cardoon]]s, tomatoes, onions, [[pancetta]], olive oil\n* ''Zuppa di ortiche'', a soup of [[Stinging nettle#Food|nettle stems]], tomatoes, onions, pancetta, olive oil.\n\nCommon second dishes (often meat and vegetable dishes) are:\n* Lamb, the most popular meat, served grilled, roasted, or stewed.\n* Many organ meats of lamb, especially [[tripe]], are popular\n* ''Coniglio alla molisana'', grilled rabbit pieces skewered with sausage and herbs\n* ''Mazzarelle'', tightly wrapped rolls made with lung and tripe of lamb\n* ''Rag\u00f9 d' agnello'', braised lamb with sweet peppers, a specialty of Isernia\n* ''Torcinelli'', rolled strips of lamb tripe, sweetbreads, and liver\n* ''Pamparella'' or pork pancetta dried with peperoncino, soaked in wine and cut into small pieces. Pamparella is used to flavor sauces, in particular the sauce for dressing the tacconi, a rustic pasta made with flour and water.\n* ''Saucicc', Paparuol' e Ova Fritte'', sausage with sweet pepper and fried eggs\n\nTypical vegetable dishes may include:\n* ''Carciofi ripieni'', artichokes stuffed with [[anchovy (food)|anchovies]] and [[caper]]s\n* Peeled sweet peppers stuffed with breadcrumbs, anchovies, parsley, [[basil]] and peperoncino, saut\u00e9ed in a frying pan and cooked with chopped tomatoes\n* ''Cipollacci con pecorino'', fried strong onions and pecorino cheese\n* ''[[Frittata]] con basilico e cipolle'', omelette with basil and onions.\n\nFish dishes include red mullet soup, and spaghetti with [[cuttlefish]]. [[Trout]] from the [[Biferno]] river is notable for its flavor, and is cooked with a simple but tasty sauce of aromatic herbs. Zuppa di pesce, a fish stew, is a specialty of [[Termoli]].\n\nThe cheeses produced in Molise are not very different from those produced in Abruzzo. The more common ones are Burrino and Manteca, soft, buttery cow's-milk cheeses; Pecorino, sheep's-milk cheese, served young and soft or aged and hard, called also \"Maciuocco\" in Molise; Scamorza, bland cow's-milk cheese, often served grilled; and [[Caciocavallo]], sheep's-milk cheese.\n\nSweets and desserts have an ancient tradition here and are linked to the history of the territory and to religious and family festivities. Most common are:\n* ''Calciumi'' (also called ''caucioni'' or ''cauciuni''), sweet [[ravioli]] filled with chestnuts, almonds, chocolate, vanilla, cooked wine [[must]]s, and cinnamon and then fried\n* ''Ciambelline'', ring-shaped cakes made in the countryside. They may be ''all'olio'' (with olive oil) or ''al vino rosso'' (with red wine).\n* ''Ferratelle all'anice'', anise cakes made in metal molds and stamped with special patterns\n* ''Ricotta pizza'', a cake pan filled with a blend of ricotta cheese, sugar, flour, butter, maraschino liqueur, and chocolate chips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abruzzomoliseheritagesociety.org/cuisine.htm#abruzzo

Italy]]. Until 1963, it formed part of the region of [[Abruzzi e Molise]], alongside the region of [[Abruzzo]]. The split, which did not become effective until 1970, makes Molise the youngest region in Italy. Covering {{convert|4438|km2|0|abbr=out}}, it is the second smallest region in the country after the [[Aosta Valley]], and has a population of 313,348 (as of 1 January 2015).\n\nThe region is split into two provinces, named after their respective capitals [[Campobasso Province|Campobasso]] and [[Isernia Province|Isernia]].

The agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, olive oil, vegetables, fruits and dairy products. Traditional products are [[Lathyrus sativus|Grass Pea (cicerchia)]] and [[Farro]]. Molise's autochthonous grape is [[Tintilia]] which has been rediscovered during the last ten years, and many other PDO (DOP) wines, both red and white.\n\nThough there is a large [[Fiat]] plant ([[Termoli]]), the industrial sector is dominated by the farming industry with small and medium-sized farms spread widely throughout the region. Another important industry is food processing: pasta, meat, milk products, oil and wine are the traditional products of the region. In the services sector the most important industries are distribution, hotels and catering, followed by transport and communications, banking and insurance. With few exceptions, in all sectors firms are small, and this explains the difficulties encountered when marketing products on a national scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf2_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721131845/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf2_eco.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}</ref>\n\nInternational tourism is growing largely as a result of the recent opening of international flights from other European countries to [[Abruzzo Airport|Pescara Airport]], which is not far to the north in Abruzzo and connected to Molise by the [[Autostrada A14 (Italy)|A14 highway]] (the only highway passing through Molise, by Termoli).\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |355000\n|1871 |374000\n|1881 |382000\n|1901 |395000\n|1911 |396000\n|1921 |383000\n|1931 |377000\n|1936 |388000\n|1951 |407000\n|1961 |358000\n|1971 |320000\n|1981 |328000\n|1991 |331000\n|2001 |321000\n|2010 (Est.)\n      |319000\n|2017 |310449\n}}\n\nThe density of the population in Molise is well below the national average.

Between 1991 (330,900 inhabitants) and 2001 (320,601 inhabitants), the population of the region decreased by 3.1%;<ref name=\"regportraits1\"/> since 2001 the population remained stable.\n\nThe region is home to two main ethnic minorities: the [[Molise Croats|Molisan Croats]] (20,000 people who speak an old Dalmatian dialect of the Croatian language alongside Italian), and those who speak the \"[[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|arbereshe]]\" dialect of Albanian in five towns of \"basso Molise\" in the province of Campobasso.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Molise}}\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nMolise comprises two provinces:\n\n[[File:Map of region of Molise, Italy, with provinces-it.svg|350px]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Province\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Area (km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Population\n! style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Density (inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n| [[Province of Campobasso]]\n| 2,909\n| 231,921\n| 79.7\n|-\n| [[Province of Isernia]]\n| 1,529\n| 88,931\n| 58.2\n|}\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|List of museums in Molise}}\nMolise has much tradition from the religious to the pagans, many museum, archeological sites, musical and food events.\n\n''Tradition''\n* The Festival dei Misteri in [[Campobasso]] (Corpus Domini)\n* Feast of Saint Pardo with ox chariot (cart) in [[Larino]] (25-26-27/May)\n* Ox chariots (La Carrese) and feast of Saint Leo in [[San Martino in Pensilis]] (30 April and 2 May)\n* The [[Ndocciata]] of [[Agnone]] (8-24/December)\n* The Saint Basso feast in [[Termoli]] with procession of boats on the sea (4 August)\n* \"U lut'm sab't d'April\" of [[Santa Croce di Magliano]] with benediction of animals (Last Saturday of April)\n* Procession of Good Friday in [[Campobasso]]\n* The procession of hooded on the Good Friday at [[Isernia]]\n* The fire of Saint Anthony the Abbot in [[Colletorto]] (17 January)\n* The feast of Saint Nicandro in [[Venafro]] (17 June)\n* The ox chariots and feast in the village of [[Ururi]] and [[Portocannone]]\n* The feast of San Biagio in [[San Biase]] (3 February), with the traditional game of the ''Morra'' and the distribution of Bread to all the inhabitants\n\n''Arts, musical and food festivals''\n* The international bagpipe festival of [[Scapoli]] in July\n* The \"Pezzata\" of [[Capracotta]] the first Sunday of August\n* The fish festival of [[Termoli]] in August\n* The Staffoli Horses in August close [[Agnone]]\n* The grape feast of [[Riccia]] in September\n* The grain feast of [[Jelsi]] on 26 July\n* The international festival of folk in the [[Matese]] in [[San Massimo]]\n* The exhibition of black truffle in [[San Pietro Avellana]]\n* The carnival of [[Larino]] in February\n* \"Gl' Cierv\" in the carnival of [[Rocchetta a Volturno|Castelnuovo del Volturno]] the last Sunday of February\n\n''Museums''\n* National museum of paleolithic in [[Isernia]]\n* Monumental complex and museum of Santa Maria delle Monache in [[Isernia]]\n* Museum of \"Tombolo\" in [[Isernia]]\n* Provincial museum of [[Samnium]] in [[Campobasso]]\n* Museum of [[Zampogna]] (Bagpipe) in [[Scapoli]]\n* Antiquarium of [[Saepinum|Saepinum-Altilia]] in [[Sepino]]\n* Photographic museum \"[[Tony Vaccaro]]\" in [[Bonefro]]\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Pasta e fagioli rapida.jpg|thumb|''[[Pasta e fagioli]]'']]\nThe cuisine of Molise is similar to the [[Abruzzo#Cuisine|cuisine of Abruzzo]], though there are some differences in the dishes and ingredients.  The flavors of Molise are dominated by the many aromatic [[herb]]s that grow there. Some of the characteristic foods include spicy [[salami]], a variety of locally produced [[cheese]]s, dishes using [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[goat meat|goat]], [[pasta]] dishes with hearty sauces, and vegetables that grow in the region.\n\nIn addition to [[bruschetta]], a typical [[antipasto]]  will consist of any of several meat dishes, such as the sausages [[capocollo]], the [[fennel]]-seasoned salsiccie al finocchio, [[soppressata]], [[ventricina]], frascateglie or sanguinaccio. In addition to these sausages, a variety of [[ham]] is available, such as smoked [[prosciutto]].  Frequently, the sausages are enjoyed with [[polenta]].\n\nMain dishes of the region include:\n*'' Brodosini'' made of [[tagliatelle]] in broth with pork cheek and fat\n* ''Calcioni di ricotta'', a specialty of [[Campobasso]], made of fried pasta stuffed with [[ricotta]], [[provolone]], prosciutto, and [[parsley]], and usually served with fried [[artichoke]]s, [[cauliflower]], [[brain (food)|brains]], [[sweetbread]], potato [[croquette]], and [[scamorza]] cheese\n* ''Cavatiegl e Patane'', or [[gnocchi]] served in a meat sauce of rabbit and pork.\n* A variety of pasta such as [[cavatelli]], [[lasagna]], or [[macaroni|maccheroni]] served with a [[rag\u00f9]] of lamb or goat\n* ''[[Pasta e fagioli]]'', pasta-and-white-bean soup cooked with pig's feet and pork rinds\n* ''Polenta d'iragn'', a polenta-like dish actually made of wheat and potatoes, sauced with raw tomatoes and pecorino\n* ''Risotto alla marinara'', a [[risotto]] with seafood\n* ''Spaghetti with diavolillo'', a strong chili pepper sauce\n* ''Zuppa di cardi'', a soup of [[cardoon]]s, tomatoes, onions, [[pancetta]], olive oil\n* ''Zuppa di ortiche'', a soup of [[Stinging nettle#Food|nettle stems]], tomatoes, onions, pancetta, olive oil.\n\nCommon second dishes (often meat and vegetable dishes) are:\n* Lamb, the most popular meat, served grilled, roasted, or stewed.\n* Many organ meats of lamb, especially [[tripe]], are popular\n* ''Coniglio alla molisana'', grilled rabbit pieces skewered with sausage and herbs\n* ''Mazzarelle'', tightly wrapped rolls made with lung and tripe of lamb\n* ''Rag\u00f9 d' agnello'', braised lamb with sweet peppers, a specialty of Isernia\n* ''Torcinelli'', rolled strips of lamb tripe, sweetbreads, and liver\n* ''Pamparella'' or pork pancetta dried with peperoncino, soaked in wine and cut into small pieces. Pamparella is used to flavor sauces, in particular the sauce for dressing the tacconi, a rustic pasta made with flour and water.\n* ''Saucicc', Paparuol' e Ova Fritte'', sausage with sweet pepper and fried eggs\n\nTypical vegetable dishes may include:\n* ''Carciofi ripieni'', artichokes stuffed with [[anchovy (food)|anchovies]] and [[caper]]s\n* Peeled sweet peppers stuffed with breadcrumbs, anchovies, parsley, [[basil]] and peperoncino, saut\u00e9ed in a frying pan and cooked with chopped tomatoes\n* ''Cipollacci con pecorino'', fried strong onions and pecorino cheese\n* ''[[Frittata]] con basilico e cipolle'', omelette with basil and onions.\n\nFish dishes include red mullet soup, and spaghetti with [[cuttlefish]]. [[Trout]] from the [[Biferno]] river is notable for its flavor, and is cooked with a simple but tasty sauce of aromatic herbs. Zuppa di pesce, a fish stew, is a specialty of [[Termoli]].\n\nThe cheeses produced in Molise are not very different from those produced in Abruzzo. The more common ones are Burrino and Manteca, soft, buttery cow's-milk cheeses; Pecorino, sheep's-milk cheese, served young and soft or aged and hard, called also \"Maciuocco\" in Molise; Scamorza, bland cow's-milk cheese, often served grilled; and [[Caciocavallo]], sheep's-milk cheese.\n\nSweets and desserts have an ancient tradition here and are linked to the history of the territory and to religious and family festivities. Most common are:\n* ''Calciumi'' (also called ''caucioni'' or ''cauciuni''), sweet [[ravioli]] filled with chestnuts, almonds, chocolate, vanilla, cooked wine [[must]]s, and cinnamon and then fried\n* ''Ciambelline'', ring-shaped cakes made in the countryside. They may be ''all'olio'' (with olive oil) or ''al vino rosso'' (with red wine).\n* ''Ferratelle all'anice'', anise cakes made in metal molds and stamped with special patterns\n* ''Ricotta pizza'', a cake pan filled with a blend of ricotta cheese, sugar, flour, butter, maraschino liqueur, and chocolate chips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abruzzomoliseheritagesociety.org/cuisine.htm#abruzzo |title=Abruzzo and Molise Heritage Society |publisher=Abruzzomoliseheritagesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309041825/http://www.abruzzomoliseheritagesociety.org/cuisine.htm#abruzzo |archivedate=2013-03-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== International relations ==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Italy}}\n\n=== Twin towns \u2014 sister cities ===\nMolise is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Nowy S\u0105cz]], [[Poland]]<ref name=\"Nowy S\u0105cz twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowysacz.pl/miasta_partnerskie|title=Miasta partnerskie i zaprzyja\u017anione Nowego S\u0105cza|accessdate = 2013-08-01|work=Urz\u0105d Miasta Nowego S\u0105cza|language=Polish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523172036/http://www.nowysacz.pl/miasta_partnerskie|archivedate=2013-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[2002 Molise earthquake]]\n* [[Ndocciata]], a torchlit parade traditionally held in Molise on Christmas Eve\n* [[Molise Croats]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://www.regione.molise.it/ Official Site of the Regione Molise] {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081207203257/http://www.regionemolise.net/ Molise Region information site] {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/39502656@N04/ Images of Molise]\n* [http://molisediscovery.com/ Molisediscovery]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232940/http://moliselab.com/ MoliseLab]\n\n{{Molise}}\n{{Regions of Italy}}\n{{Italy topics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Molise| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of Italy]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1963]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript,Script-assisted fixes: perCS1andMOS:ITALICS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molise"}

It was split into two disciplines, [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] which were further divided into different weight categories. Men competed in both disciplines whereas women only took part in the freestyle events, with 18 [[gold medal]]s awarded. [[Amateur wrestling|Wrestling]] has been contested at every modern [[Summer Olympic Games]], except [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris 1900]].\n\n==Competition format==\n19 men or 18 women competed in each division, plus 6 others allocated either to the host country or by the tripartite commission into divisions yet to be determined prior to the Olympics. Wrestlers determined by lot competed in qualification rounds to reduce the number to 16, thereafter proceeding by simple knockout to determine the finalists who competed for gold and silver.

As a result, Canadian banks broadened out to become supermarkets of financial services.\n\nAfter large bank mergers were ruled out by the federal government, some Canadian banks turned to international expansion, particularly in various U.S. markets such as banking and brokerage.\n\nTwo other notable developments in Canadian banking were the launch of [[ING Bank of Canada]] (which relies mostly on a branchless banking model), and the slow emergence of non-bank mortgage origination companies.\n\nA survey conducted by the [[World Economic Forum]] called the Global Competitiveness Report of twelve-thousand corporate executives, in 2008, concluded that [[Canada]] has the best banking system in the world, receiving a score of 6.8 out of possible seven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081009/canadian_banks_081009/20081009?hub=TopStories |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011224312/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081009/canadian_banks_081009/20081009?hub=TopStories |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-10-11 |title=Canadian banks are the soundest in the world: report |accessdate=2008-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nBetween July and September 2016, three new domestic Schedule 1 banks (Wealth One Bank of Canada, Exchange Bank of Canada, and UNI Financial Corp) have begun operating in Canada with an additional fourth bank poised to announce its commencement in the following month.

These second-tier organizations are largely Canadian domestic banking organizations or Canadian subsidiaries of foreign banks. Insurance companies in Canada have also created deposit-taking bank subsidiaries (for example [[Manulife Bank of Canada]]), and two notable non-bank consumer financial institutions are [[ATB Financial]] (a provincial financial institution owned by the Government of Alberta that operates similarly to a bank) and the [[Desjardins Group]] (an alliance of [[credit union]]s).

These other activities include mutual funds, insurance, credit cards, and brokerage activities. In addition, they have large international subsidiaries.

Examples include \"The Big Five\" banks (as mentioned above); associated brands of the Big Five such as [[Tangerine Bank|Tangerine]] and [[Simplii Financial]]; and smaller second-tier banks such as [[National Bank of Canada]], [[Laurentian Bank of Canada]], and [[Canadian Western Bank]]. Because the Schedule I banks are not subsidiaries of any foreign bank, they are the true domestic banks and are the only banks allowed to receive, hold and enforce a special [[security interest]] described and provided for under the ''Bank Act''<ref name=CanadaBankAct /> and known to Canadian lawyers and bankers as the \"Bank Act security\".\n*'''Schedule II''': Banks allowed to accept deposits and which are subsidiaries of a foreign bank. Examples include [[AMEX Bank of Canada]], [[Bank of China#Canada|Bank of China (Canada)]], [[Citibank Canada]], [[HSBC Bank Canada]], ICICI Bank Canada and [[Walmart Canada|Walmart Canada Bank]]. Like the Schedule I banks, the Schedule II banks are incorporated under the ''Bank Act''.<ref name=CanadaBankAct />\n*'''Schedule III''': Foreign banks permitted to carry on business in Canada. Examples include [[Citibank N.A.]], [[Bank of America]], [[Capital One]], [[Credit Suisse]] and [[Deutsche Bank AG]]. Unlike the Schedule I and Schedule II banks, the Schedule III banks are NOT incorporated under the ''Bank Act'' and they operate in Canada, usually within the country's largest cities (being Toronto, [[Montreal]], [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]]), under certain restrictions mentioned in the ''Bank Act''.<ref name=CanadaBankAct />\n\nThe bank regulator is the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]] (best known as ''OSFI''),<ref name=OSFI> {{cite web | url=http://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/osfi-bsif/Pages/default.aspx | title=Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions | publisher=Government of Canada}} </ref> whose authority stems from the ''Bank Act''.<ref name=CanadaBankAct /> The financial groups are also governed by regulatory bodies (bank regulators, securities regulators, insurance regulators, etc.) in each country in which they operate.\n\n==Financial crisis of 2008==\nDuring the peak of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], the [[Bank of Canada]], along with the [[Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] and the [[Federal Reserve System|US Federal Reserve]] provided up to $114 billion of liquidity support to Canadian banks.

Each award winner was voted by readers of the ''[[Smash Hits]]'' magazine.  It ended with the closure of the magazine in February 2006.\n\nThe event was initially produced by [[Harvey Goldsmith]] and [[Janet Street-Porter]]. Tim Byrne also worked on the show. He now works alongside [[Simon Cowell]].\n\nThe awards ceremony was shown on [[BBC One|BBC1]] from 1988 to 2000 then later on [[Channel 4]] from 2001 to 2005. During 2004 and 2005, it was renamed [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]] Smash Hits Poll Winners Party. Past presenters have included [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Simon Mayo]], [[Andi Peters]], [[Toby Anstis]], [[Lily Savage]], [[Ant and Dec]], [[Will Smith]], [[Melanie Sykes]], [[June Sarpong]] and [[Vernon Kay]]. Past group winners have included [[Bros]], [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Take That]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Boyzone]], [[Westlife]], [[Busted (band)|Busted]] and [[Girls Aloud]].\n\nThe event was notorious for the incident in 1991 involving [[Phillip Schofield]] and [[Carter USM]], when the band's performance was cut short, causing them to trash up the stage. Following this, when Schofield made a remark about the band's behaviour, their guitarist Les \"Fruitbat\" Carter rugby tackled Schofield. The band was temporarily banned from performing on television, but ticket sales for its tour soared.\n\nThe award itself was seen as a gimmicky object by many outside the magazine's readership, including winners such as rock bands (who only ever won their own genre-based category \"Best Rock\", although Coldplay were once nominated for Best Band). It was an oversized fake gold disc bearing the magazine's logo, turned slightly by 45 degrees to the left and placed in a black stand.\n\nThe ceremony was publicised by Anita Strymowicz for several years.

She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence originated the Mama character which first appeared in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' from 1974 until 1978 and on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' in 1979; ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' was a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV movie]] based on \"The Family\" sketches characters; ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (first on [[NBC]], then revolutionized in [[first-run syndication]]); and finally in the ongoing ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''. With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the \"Mama\" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'';<ref name=\"1of100\">Handleman, Jay (21 February 2003).

She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]]. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of ''Mama's Family''; she wore no support hose during \"The Family\" sketches nor the ''Eunice'' movie.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=758mUmQxV6gC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+Mama's+orthopedic+shoes&source=bl&ots=duy-zxLKkw&sig=So6pPTb4V_ZePwU42hrRObEh4K8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OvM5UfumGqrr2QWShIEY&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Vicki%20Lawrence%20Mama's%20orthopedic%20shoes&f=false |title=Funny Ladies - Michael Karol - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> For [[footwear]], Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled]] [[brogue shoe|brogue]] style.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=Mama's+Family+Thelma+Harper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iPA5Ua3WH4bk2AWnw4GgCw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Mama's%20Family%20Thelma%20Harper&f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]]: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \n \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral [[headpiece]]s; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\n==Mama's persona==\n\n===Vicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution===\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between \"The Family\" sketches and the first life of ''Mama's Family''. Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill.

She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence originated the Mama character which first appeared in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' from 1974 until 1978 and ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' in 1979; ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' was a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV movie]] based on \"The Family\" sketches characters; ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (first on [[NBC]], then revolutionized in [[first-run syndication]]); and finally in the ongoing ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''. With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the \"Mama\" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'';<ref name=\"1of100\">Handleman, Jay (21 February 2003).

As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]].

However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.
