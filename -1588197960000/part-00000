In this humourous and novel Print, the Faces are capable of 34 different changes (position1).jpg|thumb|A toy lithograph depicting a stereotypical mid-nineteenth century village schoolmistress]]\nThe word '''schoolmaster''', or simply '''master''', refers to a male [[school]] [[teacher]]. This usage survives in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]], both [[secondary school|secondary]] and [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory]], but is generally obsolete elsewhere.\n\n==Origins==\nThe word \u201cmaster\u201d in this context translates the [[Latin]] word '''magister'''. In England, a schoolmaster was usually a university graduate, and until the 19th century the only universities were [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]]. Their graduates in almost all subjects graduated as [[Bachelors of Arts]] and were then promoted to Masters of Arts (''magister artium'') simply by seniority. Traditionally the essential subject in an English [[grammar school]]. It is a teacher, and most students will usually call them \"Master\" or \"Teacher\" like in Star Wars. Star Wars is cool, by the way. If you ever see this, the Last Jedi was a terrible movie. \n\n==Usage==\nWhere a school has more than one schoolmaster, a man in charge of the school is the [[Head teacher|headmaster]], sometimes spelt as two words, \"head master\". This name survives in British independent schools, but it has been replaced by ''head teacher'' in most British publicly funded schools, although \"headmaster\" is often still used colloquially, particularly in [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]]s, and is equivalent to the principal in [[United States|American]] schools.  The term \"headmaster\" also survives in some [[United States|American]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] independent schools.<ref>[[A. C. Benson]], \n''The Schoolmaster: A Commentary Upon the Aims and Methods of an Assistant master in a Public School'' (1902), p. 47</ref>\n\nA range of other terms is derived from \"schoolmaster\" and \"headmaster\", including '''deputy headmaster''' (the second most senior teacher), '''senior master''' and '''second master''' (both used in some independent schools instead of deputy headmaster), and [[housemaster]], the schoolmaster in charge of a [[boarding school]] [[house system|house]]). Some independent schools use other titles for the head of the teaching staff, including \"High Master\" and \"Rector\".\n\nThe female equivalent of \"schoolmaster\" is '''schoolmistress''', which is used with all the same prefixes.<ref>Alfred Habegger, ''Masked: The Life of Anna Leonowens, Schoolmistress at the Court of Siam'' (2014), p. 7</ref>\n\nThe archaic term for the second schoolmaster in a school in England is '''usher'''.<ref>''Reports of the Commissioners Appointed in Pursuance of Acts of Parliament'', Volume 33 (1839), p. 628</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==See also==\n* [[Education in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Roger Ascham|Ascham, Roger]].

In this humourous and novel Print, the Faces are capable of 34 different changes (position1).jpg|thumb|A toy lithograph depicting a stereotypical mid-nineteenth century village schoolmistress]]\nThe word '''schoolmaster''', or simply '''master''', refers to a male [[school]] [[teacher]]. This usage survives in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]], both [[secondary school|secondary]] and [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory]], but is generally obsolete elsewhere.\n\n==Origins==\nThe word \u201cmaster\u201d in this context translates the [[Latin]] word '''magister'''. In England, a schoolmaster was usually a university graduate, and until the 19th century the only universities were [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]]. Their graduates in almost all subjects graduated as [[Bachelors of Arts]] and were then promoted to Masters of Arts (''magister artium'') simply by seniority. Traditionally the essential subject in an English [[grammar school]] was Latin.\n\n==Usage==\nWhere a school has more than one schoolmaster, a man in charge of the school is the [[Head teacher|headmaster]], sometimes spelt as two words, \"head master\". This name survives in British independent schools, but it has been replaced by ''head teacher'' in most British publicly funded schools, although \"headmaster\" is often still used colloquially, particularly in [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]]s, and is equivalent to the principal in [[United States|American]] schools.  The term \"headmaster\" also survives in some [[United States|American]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] independent schools.<ref>[[A. C. Benson]], \n''The Schoolmaster: A Commentary Upon the Aims and Methods of an Assistant master in a Public School'' (1902), p. 47</ref>\n\nA range of other terms is derived from \"schoolmaster\" and \"headmaster\", including '''deputy headmaster''' (the second most senior teacher), '''senior master''' and '''second master''' (both used in some independent schools instead of deputy headmaster), and [[housemaster]], the schoolmaster in charge of a [[boarding school]] [[house system|house]]). Some independent schools use other titles for the head of the teaching staff, including \"High Master\" and \"Rector\".\n\nThe female equivalent of \"schoolmaster\" is '''schoolmistress''', which is used with all the same prefixes.<ref>Alfred Habegger, ''Masked: The Life of Anna Leonowens, Schoolmistress at the Court of Siam'' (2014), p. 7</ref>\n\nThe archaic term for the second schoolmaster in a school in England is '''usher'''.<ref>''Reports of the Commissioners Appointed in Pursuance of Acts of Parliament'', Volume 33 (1839), p. 628</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==See also==\n* [[Education in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Roger Ascham|Ascham, Roger]].
