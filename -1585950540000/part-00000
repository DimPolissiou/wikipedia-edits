The film opens with the tribe holding a tournament of various physical contests to select a new queen. In the final competition, man-hating [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] defeats her longtime rival Oreitheia in a wrestling match and is crowned queen. The new ruler believes the tribe has gone soft and imposes a rigid discipline that allows sexual relations with men only once a year to procreate. Antiope also wants a return to a more egalitarian society, which doesn't sit well with Oreitheia and many of the other high Amazons, and she hatches various schemes to eliminate Antiope and take her place on the throne.\n\nSince there are no men in the tribe, the Amazons hire men from another nation once a year for reproductive purposes; an \"unpleasant but necessary\" ordeal which Antiope herself also dutifully participates in. The Amazons soon go to meet a group of [[Greeks|Greek]] soldiers led King [[Theseus]] of [[Athens]] for their annual mating ceremony. Meanwhile, Oreitheia and her loyal followers attempt to undermine the queen's rule by slipping an [[aphrodisiac]] in her water, only for her handmaiden to drink it instead and suffer the effects. Curious about of the Amazons, Theseus pretends to be a low-ranking captain and has sex with Antiope, impregnating her in the process. Much to the queen's dismay, she quite enjoys her first time having sex with a man. The next day, during a series of contests held between the two groups, Antiope attempts to one-up Theseus in a [[show jumping]] competition after he attempts to impress her. This results in the queen injuring her leg and is left unable to perform in bed the following night. Theseus meets with Antiope to apologize for showing off and attempts to change her man-hating ways, but her resolve remains quite firm. Secretly worried that she has feelings for Theseus and being perceived as weak, Antiope orders the Amazons to depart for home a day early.  \n     \nThe king recommends to the queen a certain way back to their home through the Blue Mountains, inadvertently sending the tribe into a [[Scythian]] ambush. Realizing his mistake, Theseus assembles a garrison of soldiers to aid the Amazons as they are attacked, and they drive off the Scythians. Believing that the Greeks deliberately set them up, the Amazons mount an expedition lead by Oreitheia to pillage the villages of the Scythians in retaliation. During the following months, Theseus has become smitten with the queen and sets up a makeshift camp near the Amazon's city. At one time covertly saving her from an assassination attempt and later sneaks into her bedchambers to make love to her again, the latter which she reluctantly accepts. Theseus also sends his wife Queen [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] to the city under the guise of a feminist representative from [[Crete]], in order to learn more about the Amazon's matriarchal society. Suspicious of Phaedra's true motivations, Antiope followers her back to Theseus's campsite and discovers his deception. Seeing him with another women causes Antiope to believe the Theseus was merely using her and she angrily breaks off their relationship, making future plans for revenge. With their cover blown, Theseus and Phaedra return to Athens for the time being.\n\nThe time finally comes for the queen to give birth, but to her sadness the child is a boy and is left out to die as male children are not wanted by the Amazons. The apparent loss of her son causes Antiope to become conflicted and later more outspoken when Oreitheia's war party returns successful from their campaign against the Scythians. This in turn causes Antiope to lose some support among her fellow Amazons. Taking advantage of the political turmoil, Oreitheia attempts to murder Antiope in her sleep, but the queen anticipates her betrayal and catches her by spear point. Deciding that they need to settle their dispute once and for all, the two Amazons engage in a nude wrestling match as a thunderstorm rages outside. Exhausted from their lengthy struggle, they end up falling into each other's embrace and become lovers.\n\nAntiope arranges for another meeting with the Greeks to mate again and then kill them all in revenge for their perceived roll in setting up the ambush. Despite grim predictions from their priests that the mission will result in heavy losses, Oreitheia encourages Antiope to go through with it. Antiope and Theseus are finally reunited at the camp, where he confesses his love for her. After they're finished making love, Theseus reveals that he already knew about the assassination in advance thanks to some treacherous Amazons. The king also tells her that he had rescued their son (now named [[Hippolytus (Greek myth)|Hippolytus]]) and she slips out of the tent with him to go see her child in Athens. The other Amazons think she's been kidnapped, with only Oreitheia and few others realizing the truth, and chase after the Greeks to prevent word of this great dishonor from spreading. The Amazons eventually catch up and have a battle with the Greeks. To keep Antiope out of harms way, Theseus orders his men to tie her to the carriage against her will. As the conflict ensues, both side suffer casualties and Antiope can only watch helplessly as Oreitheia is killed on the battlefield. Deciding that there has been enough bloodshed, Theseus calls for the fighting to stop. In the aftermath of the battle, Antiope recognizes Oreitheia's desire to become queen, and places the ring symbolizing her status as queen on her finger. Having been conquered by the Greeks, Antiope and the survivors join them on the long journey back to Athens. Though disheartened that both she and the Amazons as a whole are now ruined, Antiope looks forward to her future role as Theseus's political advisor and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Phaedra is his first wife, not his lover.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Alena Johnston]]: [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]]\n*[[Sabine Sun]]: Oreitheia\n*[[Rosanna Yanni]]: [[Penthesilea]]\n*[[Helga Lin\u00e9]]: High Priestess\n*[[Rebecca Potok]]: [[Melanippe]]\n*[[Malisa Longo]]: Leuthera \n*[[Lucy Tiller]]: Alana\n*[[Almut Berg]]: Cynara\n*[[Luciana Paluzzi]]: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]\n*[[Angelo Infanti]]: [[Theseus]]\n*[[Fausto Tozzi]]: General\n*[[Benito Stefanelli]]: Commander\n*[[\u00c1ngel del Pozo]]: Captain\n*[[Franco Borelli]]: Perithous\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0070140}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|war-goddess}}\n\n{{Terence Young}}\n\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1970s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Terence Young]]\n[[Category:Italian films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:Spanish films]]\n[[Category:Sword and sorcery films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Greco-Roman mythology]]\n[[Category:1970s feminist films]]\n[[Category:Italian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Spanish LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:French LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Riz Ortolani]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda]]\n\n\n{{fantasy-film-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Adventure film directed by Terence Young in 1973}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = War Goddess\n| image          = War goddess.jpg\n| director       = [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]\n| writer         = Richard Aubrey (original screenplay)<br>Arduino Maiuri (as Dino Maiuri)<br>[[Robert Graves]]<br>Massimo De Rita<br>Serge de la Roche (screenplay)<br>Antonio Recoder<br>[[Charles Spaak]]<br>[[Luciano Vincenzoni]] (story)<br>Terence Young\n| starring       = Alena Johnston<br>Sabine Sun<br>[[Rosanna Yanni]]<br>[[Helga Lin\u00e9]]<br>[[Luciana Paluzzi]]\n| music          = [[Riz Ortolani]]\n| cinematography = [[Aldo Tonti]]<br>[[Alejandro Ulloa]]\n| editing        = [[Roger Dwyre]]\n| producer       = [[Nino Crisman]]<br>Gregorio Sacrist\u00e1n<br>[[Andr\u00e9 G\u00e9nov\u00e8s]] (recut version)\n| distributor    =\n| released       = 1973\n| runtime        = 105 minutes\n| awards         =\n| country        = Italy<br>France<br>Spain \n| language       = Italian<br>English dub\n| budget         =\n}}\n'''''War Goddess''''' (also known as '''''The Amazons''''' and '''''The Bare-Breasted Warriors''''') is a 1973 [[adventure film]] directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] and starring Alena Johnston, [[Sabine Sun]], [[Rosanna Yanni]], [[Helga Lin\u00e9]], and [[Luciana Paluzzi]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mario Gerosa|title=Il cinema di Terence Young|publisher=Il foglio, 2009}}</ref> It was a co-production between Italy (where it was released as '''''Le guerriere dal seno nudo'''''), France (where it is known with the title '''''Les amazones'''''), and Spain (where is it is known as '''''Las amazonas''''').<ref>{{cite book|last=Stefano Piselli, Riccardo Morocchi|title=Sexy heroine ; erotic heroines in movies|publisher=Glittering images, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=February 2020}} <!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nSet nearly three thousand years ago, the [[Amazons]] are a tribe of proud warrior women, who have seceded from the rest of the world, and set up a state purely composed of their own sex.

Though disheartened that both she and the Amazons as a whole are now ruined, Antiope looks forward to her future role as Theseus's political advisor and is pleasantly surprised to find out that Phaedra is his first wife, not his lover.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Alena Johnston]]: [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]]\n*[[Sabine Sun]]: Oreitheia\n*[[Rosanna Yanni]]: [[Penthesilea]]\n*[[Helga Lin\u00e9]]: High Priestess\n*[[Rebecca Potok]]: [[Melanippe]]\n*[[Malisa Longo]]: Leuthera \n*[[Lucy Tiller]]: Alana\n*[[Almut Berg]]: Cynara\n*[[Luciana Paluzzi]]: [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]\n*[[Angelo Infanti]]: [[Theseus]]\n*[[Fausto Tozzi]]: General\n*[[Benito Stefanelli]]: Commander\n*[[\u00c1ngel del Pozo]]: Captian\n*[[Franco Borelli]]: Perithous\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0070140}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|war-goddess}}\n\n{{Terence Young}}\n\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1970s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Terence Young]]\n[[Category:Italian films]]\n[[Category:French films]]\n[[Category:Spanish films]]\n[[Category:Sword and sorcery films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Greco-Roman mythology]]\n[[Category:1970s feminist films]]\n[[Category:Italian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Spanish LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:French LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Riz Ortolani]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda]]\n\n\n{{fantasy-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: doesn\u2019t \u2192 doesn't, make-shift \u2192 makeshift, Captian \u2192 Captain", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Goddess"}

While binary fission may be the means of division by most prokaryotes, there are alternative manners of division, such as [[budding]], that have been observed. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of [[DNA replication]].\n\nFor simple [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] [[microorganism]]s such as the [[amoeba]], one cell division is equivalent to [[reproduction]] \u2013 an entire new organism is created. On a larger scale, mitotic cell division can create [[Offspring|progeny]] from multicellular organisms, such as plants that grow from cuttings.

In this stage there is a cytoplasmic division that occurs at the end or either mitosis or meiosis. At this stage there is a resulting irreversible separation leading to two daughter cells.

This as a result leads to cytokinesis producing unequal daughter cells containing completely different amounts or concentrations of fate-determining molecules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guertin|first=David A.|first2=Susanne |last2=Trautmann |last3=McCollum|first3=Dannel|date=2002-06-01|title=Cytokinesis in Eukaryotes|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|language=en|volume=66|issue=2|pages=155\u2013178|doi=10.1128/MMBR.66.2.155-178.2002|issn=1092-2172|pmid=12040122|pmc=120788}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Kinetochore.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Image of the [[mitotic spindle]] in a human cell showing microtubules in green, chromosomes (DNA) in blue, and kinetochores in red.]]\n'''Cells''' are broadly classified into two main categories: simple, non-nucleated [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells, and complex, nucleated [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells.

Learning that her old high school has reported ten to eighteen [[teen pregnancy|teen pregnancies]] in the last eight weeks, Sidney investigates the situation. Gloucester High nurse Kim tells Sidney that students have requested 150 pregnancy test kits in recent weeks. Nurse Kim requests [[birth control]] provided in the school, but her request is declined. When Sidney interviews local students, she encounters Sara, Karissa, Iris, and Rose, who imagine an ideal life as mothers. Three of the four are already pregnant and urging the fourth, Sara, to imitate them.\n\nHaving permission from her mother Lorraine, Sara goes to her boyfriend Jesse's house, against the wishes of her father Michael, and becomes pregnant with fear of 'losing' Jesse's affection. Her friends are pleased, but Karissa's mother  is struggling financially, and her boyfriend leaves her upon learning of the pregnancy. When Sara's father learns the same of Sara, he accuses Jesse, and later quarrels with Lorraine. Sara and Lorraine's relationship deteriorates leading Sidney to console Sara. It is revealed that Sidney and a school faculty member, Brady, had a baby at the age of 16, which Sidney gave for adoption. Jesse tells Sara that his father is willing to pay for an abortion, but Sara tells him to cancel his plans for college and a career in baseball to start their family together.\n\nLorraine proposes a meeting of the school council to raise funds for the school's daycare. Sidney, in attendance, asks instead for birth control and reveals Sara's pregnancy, resulting in Lorraine resigning from the council. A news story in [[Time Magazine]] quotes the school's principal that the girls informed him of their hopes and starts a media frenzy. Jesse's father tells him he should focus on college and baseball instead of Sara which cause a fallout between them. Rose confirms the story to Sidney and discuss why the girls wanted to become mothers. Sidney and Sara have a private conversation. Sara tells Sidney that her dream is to marry Jesse and have a family, not viewing a college education or a career as a priority; Jesse, in contrast, wants to attend college and pursue a career in professional baseball. A call from Karissa confirms that Rose gave birth to a baby girl, her friends are shocked by the difficulties of labor probably caused by her smoking during the pregnancy. She requires 37 stitches from vaginal tearing and the baby in an incubator.\n\nJesse and Lorraine having overheard Sidney asking Sara to publish her revelation, Jesse rejects Sara. During a party, Karissa's mother confronts her, saying that she herself struggled hard as a single mother and wants a better future for her and not to make the same choice. At the party, Sara again apologizes to Jesse profusely but he refuses to forgive her and confesses that he can never trust her again and does not want anything to do with the baby or her. Jesse also tearfully confessed that she ruined all chances of them being together forever. Feeling rejected and hurt, Sara binge drinks which led to her nearly succumbing to alcohol poisoning but later reconciles with her parents. Lorraine convinces the school council to keep her on the board and argues for the school to offer birth control and encourage abstinence.\n\nAn epilogue, Sidney reveals that the principal resigned as a [[scapegoat]] to the media and that the school's [[daycare center]] is full, likely causing most girls to leave school for better daycare. She then stresses that parents must be particular when advising their children about love, family and relationships, and wishes the new mothers 'the very best of luck'. Rose is miserable in new motherhood as her family ridicules her of having a baby too young. During the final months of her pregnancy, Sara sees Jesse with his new girlfriend. Although content with the baby, she is still sad to see what it would have been like if she was not pregnant and still be with him, planning for college. She eventually regrets getting pregnant so young and would have waited years than rushing into it to make Jesse stay. The film concludes with Sara happily raising her baby girl, with the support of her parents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Sidney Bloom\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as Sara Dougan\n* [[David Clayton Rogers]] as Brady Leary\n* [[Max Ehrich]] as Jesse Moretti\n* [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]] as Michael Dougan\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Nurse Kim Daly\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Lorraine Dougan\n*Michelle DeFraites as Karissa\n*Jenna Leigh Hall as Iris\n*Erin Frederic as Kathleen Kingsbury; the Reporter\n*Kelly Heyer as Rose\n*Tim Powell as Principal Bachman\n* [[Ben Winchell]] as Troy\n\n==Production==\nOf the two hundred and fourteen [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Original Movies released up to 2011, ''The Pregnancy Pact'' was ranked as the fourth highest rated movie on Lifetime television.<ref name= \"ratings\">{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Mike |url= https://www.multichannel.com/news/lifetimes-pregnancy-pact-cables-most-watched-film-among-women-18-34-1994-363541 |title=Lifetime's 'Pregnancy Pact' Is Cable's Most-Watched Film Among Women 18-34 Since 1994 |work=[[Multichannel News]] |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film uses actual news footage from the time of the story, including footage of Gloucester's then-mayor Carolyn Kirk accusing school principal Bachman of giving unverified information to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1528227}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pregnancy Pact, The}}\n[[Category:2010 television films]]\n[[Category:2010s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Drama television films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Lifetime (TV network) films]]\n[[Category:Teenage pregnancy in film]]\n[[Category:Teenage pregnancy in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = The Pregnancy Pact\n| image                = PregnancyPact2010Poster.jpg\n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = TV poster\n| genre                = \n| creator              = \n| based_on             = \n| writer               = Pam Davis<br />Teena Booth\n| screenplay           = \n| story                = \n| director             = Rosemary Rodriguez\n| starring             = [[Thora Birch]]<br />[[Madisen Beaty]]<br />[[Camryn Manheim]]\n| narrated             = \n| theme_music_composer = Richard Marvin\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_episodes         = \n| producer             = Laurence Ducceschi<br />Robert M.

Feeling rejected and hurt , Sara binge drinks which led to her nearly succumbing to alcohol poisoning but later reconciles with her parents. Lorraine convinces the school council to keep her on the board and argues for the school to offer birth control and encourage abstinence.\n\nAn epilogue, Sidney reveals that the principal resigned as a [[scapegoat]] to the media and that the school's [[daycare center]] is full, likely causing most girls to leave school for better daycare. She then stresses that parents must be particular when advising their children about love, family and relationships, and wishes the new mothers 'the very best of luck'. Rose is miserable in new motherhood as her family ridicules her of having a baby too young. During the final months of her pregnancy, Sara sees Jesse with his new girlfriend. Although content with the baby, she is still sad to see what it would have been like if she was not pregnant and still be with him, planning for college. She eventually regrets getting pregnant so young and would have waited years than rushing into it to make Jesse stay. The film concludes with Sara happily raising her baby girl, with the support of her parents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thora Birch]] as Sidney Bloom\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as Sara Dougan\n* [[David Clayton Rogers]] as Brady Leary\n* [[Max Ehrich]] as Jesse Moretti\n* [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]] as Michael Dougan\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Nurse Kim Daly\n* [[Nancy Travis]] as Lorraine Dougan\n*Michelle DeFraites as Karissa\n*Jenna Leigh Hall as Iris\n*Erin Frederic as Kathleen Kingsbury; the Reporter\n*Kelly Heyer as Rose\n*Tim Powell as Principal Bachman\n* [[Ben Winchell]] as Troy\n\n==Production==\nOf the two hundred and fourteen [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Original Movies released up to 2011, ''The Pregnancy Pact'' was ranked as the fourth highest rated movie on Lifetime television.<ref name= \"ratings\">{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Mike |url= https://www.multichannel.com/news/lifetimes-pregnancy-pact-cables-most-watched-film-among-women-18-34-1994-363541 |title=Lifetime's 'Pregnancy Pact' Is Cable's Most-Watched Film Among Women 18-34 Since 1994 |work=[[Multichannel News]] |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film uses actual news footage from the time of the story, including footage of Gloucester's then-mayor Carolyn Kirk accusing school principal Bachman of giving unverified information to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1528227}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pregnancy Pact, The}}\n[[Category:2010 television films]]\n[[Category:2010s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Drama television films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Lifetime (TV network) films]]\n[[Category:Teenage pregnancy in film]]\n[[Category:Teenage pregnancy in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: a incubator \u2192 an incubator,  ,  \u2192 , , \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pregnancy_Pact"}

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]]. On the [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] of ''All Stars'', \"synergy\" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).\n\n===''Untucked''===\n{{Main|RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked}}\nThe first season of ''Drag Race'' was accompanied by a seven-episode [[web series]], titled ''Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race''. [[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]]. The fourth season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by ''All Stars'' season three winner, [[Trixie Mattel]], with eliminated AS4 contestant [[Manila Luzon]] subbing for her in the finale episode. Luzon also hosts the Pit Stop for season eleven. The current host of the show is [[Bob the Drag Queen]], winner of Season 8.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of RuPaul's Drag Race episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"height: 4em;\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season\n!

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]]. On the [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] of ''All Stars'', \"synergy\" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).\n\n===''Untucked''===\n{{Main|RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked}}\nThe first season of ''Drag Race'' was accompanied by a seven-episode [[web series]], titled ''Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race''. [[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]]. The fourth season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by ''All Stars'' season three winner, [[Trixie Mattel]], with eliminated AS4 contestant [[Manila Luzon]] subbing for her in the finale episode. Luzon also hosts the Pit Stop for season eleven. The current host of the show is [[Bob the Drag Queen]], winner of Season 8.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of RuPaul's Drag Race episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"height: 4em;\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season\n!

The show is set in Mirador de Montepinar, a condominium located in the suburbs of [[Madrid]]. The show is an indirect successor to the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] comedy ''[[Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva]]''. The name is a pun on the verb \"avecinarse\", which means both \"become neighbour to\" and \"approach\", and is used in expression ''la que se avecina'' meaning \"the trouble that is approaching\", so it alludes both to being neighbours and the friction that exists between the characters.\n\n''La que se avecina'' debuted on Telecinco, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n|FDF]] and [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Espa\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' vs 'La que se avecina': el duelo resucita en la TDT |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/15023/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-vs-la-que-se-avecina-el-duelo-resucita-en-la-tdt/ |work=FormulaTV |date=11 May 2010 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='La que se avecina' y 'Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' tambi\u00e9n triunfan en Paramount Comedy |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/23559/la-que-se-avecina-aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-tambien-triunfan-paramount-comedy/ |work=Formula TV |date=12 February 2012 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref> The series debuted on 22 April 2007, the show began to become much more prominent in its third season, becoming one of the most widely watched shows in Spain.

On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaqu\u00edn is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the show flat on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Maite Figueroa Espinosa and their 3 children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father . The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentinian and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to get married to Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Maite takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Maite remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Maite alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Maite, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Maite, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is that Judith and Enrique get married. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first 9 episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Maite, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Maite, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and get married. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Maite continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job in Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after 6 months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Maite leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Maite and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Maite will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn. Maite writes an erotic novel based on the romances of Mirador de Montepinar. Berta will go to a spa at her bachelorette party with the girls in the building and she will meet Araceli with whom she is about to go to bed when the owner of the spa (Araceli's girlfriend) sees them. Araceli when she breaks up with her, without a house, goes to Bajo B and will make Enrique and Teresa break up. Judith tries to return with Trevor but he already expects a son with another girl. Rebeca throws her out of the house and goes with Dylan to live with Enrique. La Chusa and Ferm\u00edn break up and she refuses to leave, even though she does not pay the rent. Raquel falls in love with Diego, Fina's son, but Fina intervenes and gets Diego to think that she is crazy. Antonio sees how his son is now: a woman. It happens to be called \u00c1lvaro a Alba. Alba starts dating Leo. Antonio and Berta get married. To Maite they publish the book to him and it is reconciled with Amador and buys with him the Under A, where La Chusa de okupa is. Enrique, fed up with Judith, Araceli and Teresa treating him badly, leaves them with a note.\n\n===Season 9 (2016)===\nVicente is named the new president of Mirador de Montepinar. His consort Ferm\u00edn, moves with him to 2\u00baB to help him with the mandate since Vicente is not excited. However, the power of these two will be full of ups and downs. Enrique returns to the community because his party has named him mayor after the departure of Mar\u00eda Teresa. Enrique will have to learn from Crist\u00f3bal, a corrupt politician. After eight seasons, Leo dies when the parachute is not opened in a gift from Alba. Alba overcomes her depression with Teodoro, Amador's brother, with whom she marries. Teodoro refloats his father-in-law Antonio's fishmonger, but his friendship is not earned. Alba will save to do the sex change operation and then will have to wait to be able to \"consummate\" which is what Theodore is waiting impatiently. After the departure of Rebeca, Judith will not stop giving emotional thrombi. Between his ligues they are: a trainer obsessed with the sport, a homosexual catholic, a patient with an imaginary friend, Trevor, a millionaire friend of Javi ... At the end of the season he goes to Ibiza where he falls in love and leaves the Serie. Maite is again what it was like: a penny with money. With La Chusa as a maid, Maite pays Amador a salary to keep custody of her four children, some spoiled. Start a relationship with Hector, a hipster. Amador rents 2\u00baA with Teodoro. Then he meets Yolanda \"Yoli\" a seamstress with a safe and problematic character. Yoli will bring her mother, Menchu, noisy and like her daughter, causing several problems, such as: Causing Teodoro and Alba to leave the 2nd A and leave with Antonio and Berta, not accept that Amador leaves him and try to have children with him, renting Enrique the Low B after the departure of Araceli and settling in Attic A with his mother at the end of the season. Besides, they emphasize their fights with Maite, Alba ... The relationship between Nines and Coque will go through problems. Fermin tries to conquer Araceli until she leaves. Fine take it with Javi and Lola, who are still fighting for their love despite their debts. Bruno is a pianist who has just been abandoned by his wife. She becomes a patient of Judith and needs her help so much that she moves to the 1st B, property of the late Leo. Seeing the world of lies and corruption in which he is submerged, Enrique resigns and tries to found his own party.\n\nThe building is broken little by little and works are needed. For this, the neighbors will have to go to all kinds of places to make time: A hotel, a makeshift campsite, Villazarcillo (the village of the deceased Justi, the mother of Amador and Teodoro), the old house of Bruno ... Al final the building is ready and even has some other novelty.\n\nAt the end of the season Amador asks for a divorce to take half of what he has. This makes Maite hire a hit man. Theodore breaks up with Alba because he did not like it when they made love. The hit man shoots Amador but he covers himself with Theodore without knowing if he lives or dies. Diego returns, the son of Fina. Diego sees at last how his mother really is and it seems that he is going to send her to a nursing home. Besides, a relationship with Raquel begins, with which it seems that he is leaving for China. It is not known if Theodore lives or if Raquel and Fina have left.\n\n===Season 10 (2017\u201318)===\nFina escapes from the nursing home where she was interned and returns to live at 2&nbsp;\u00b0C. Berta and Antonio are still married but the latter wants them to live separately and goes to live with Enrique, leaving Berta living at 1&nbsp;\u00b0C along with her daughter Alba, who is now single because she has left him with Teodoro. Both will have to carry with difficulty the business of Mariscos Recios, before the passivity of its owner to 50%, Antonio. Alba will be attracted to Enrique throughout the season and will have several encounters behind Antonio's back. After the departure of Judith, are Yoli and Menchu who buy Attic A, characters that will cause multiple problems in the building. Ferm\u00edn, who continues his relationship with Menchu, will go live with them. In addition, he will continue to serve as \"Richelieu\" of the new president, Bruno Quiroga. The latter will try to maintain an asexual relationship with Maite, who will also have meetings with Hector, who has returned to Montepinar. Coque ends his relationship with Nines and takes vacations, leaving the community with the vacant janitor plaza. In addition, he goes to live with Enrique and Antonio at Bajo B. The latter recover the bar from the catastrophic rental contract that Enrique maintained with Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, baptizing him as Tony & Henry. Nines leaves her job and instead it will be Alba who at first helps her father in the business. Theodore and Amador are again the only tenants of the 2nd. The latter will try to recover Yoli's love, although she passes from him; Meanwhile, he will pretend to be Fina's caregiver in front of Diego, his son, in exchange for a salary and with the objective that Diego stays calm and stops visiting his mother so much. Diego will begin a relationship with Raquel and will take her to China although eventually she returns. Maite will have to share with her assistant La Chusa with Bruno, who also hires her and who also gets pregnant through artificial insemination.

The show is set in Mirador de Montepinar, a condominium located in the suburbs of [[Madrid]]. The show is an indirect successor to the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] comedy ''[[Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva]]''. The name is a pun on the verb \"avecinarse\", which means both \"become neighbour to\" and \"approach\", and is used in expression ''la que se avecina'' meaning \"the trouble that is approaching\", so it alludes both to being neighbours and the friction that exists between the characters.\n\n''La que se avecina'' debuted on Telecinco, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Factor\u00eda de Ficci\u00f3n|FDF]] and [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central Espa\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' vs 'La que se avecina': el duelo resucita en la TDT |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/15023/aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-vs-la-que-se-avecina-el-duelo-resucita-en-la-tdt/ |work=FormulaTV |date=11 May 2010 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='La que se avecina' y 'Aqu\u00ed no hay quien viva' tambi\u00e9n triunfan en Paramount Comedy |url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/23559/la-que-se-avecina-aqui-no-hay-quien-viva-tambien-triunfan-paramount-comedy/ |work=Formula TV |date=12 February 2012 |language=es |access-date=30 September 2018 |publisher=Noxvo}}</ref> The series debuted on 22 April 2007, the show began to become much more prominent in its third season, becoming one of the most widely watched shows in Spain.

On the top floor, there are two flats, A and B: In flat A live the brothers Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn Arias. Sergio is an actor by trade and a playboy by nature, while Joaqu\u00edn is an unlucky-in-love estate agent, constantly battling to keep his job and sell the show flat on the ground floor. In Flat B live Javi Maroto, president of the community, and his wife Lola Trujillo. As president, Javi is often inundated with petty complaints from the residents, who include his parents, Vicente Maroto and Gregoria Guti\u00e9rrez, who live below him in apartment 2B. They share a floor with Amador Rivas, Maite Figueroa Espinosa and their 3 children (apartment 2A); and Germ\u00e1n Palomares, a defaulter whose identity is completely unknown. In flat 1A live Cristina Aguilera, a woman whose wedding was recently called off by her fianc\u00e9, who ran off with another woman, and Silvio Ram\u00edrez, a gay man from Cuba who often poses as her boyfriend, and even as her fianc\u00e9 in the final episode. In flat 1B lives Leo Roman\u00ed, vice-president of the community who has an on-off relationship with Cristina. In flat 1C live Antonio Recio, a seafood wholesaler, and his wife Berta Escobar. On the ground floor below there are four spaces: flat A is the building's show flat, which is occupied by Izaskun Sagastume and Mari Tere Valverde, a couple of elderly friends who become [[squatter]]s in the flat and stay using mischievous, and often legally doubtful, means, but end up purchasing the flat for a token sum of 1 euro. In flat B reside Enrique Pastor, a civil servant, his wife Araceli, her mother Rosario (Charo), and his teenage son Francisco (Fran). They are joined later in the series by Juli\u00e1n, Enrique's father . The two other spaces on the ground floor are occupied by a hairdresser's shop, owned by Araceli and staffed by Fabio Sabatani, a gay Argentinian and friend of Silvio, and Sandra Espinosa, a young insecure hairdresser; and the estate agents' office where Joaqu\u00edn works alongside Eric Cort\u00e9s and their boss Raquel Villanueva. Other recurring characters are M\u00e1ximo \u00c1ngulo (Maxi), the community's doorman and husband (separated) of Izaskun, and Coque Calatrava, the ex-convict gardener.\n\n===Season 2 (2008)===\n{{Main|La que se avecina (season 2)}}\nMost of the main characters from season one stay for the second season, although notable departures are Cristina, who left for unknown reasons, Rosario (Charo), whose character left due to the death of the actress playing the part, [[Emma Penella]], and Araceli, who left her husband Enrique, who has to look after Fran all by himself. Eric moves into Sergio and Joaqu\u00edn's apartment, while Raquel, her cousin Nines, and her friend Blanca, all single ladies looking to start a new stage of their lives, move into Cristina and Silvio's old flat after Silvio is evicted. Nines takes on work as a maid in various flats in the building, and in one episode is about to get married to Leo before he leaves her at the altar after claiming he's in love with Raquel. A structural change is that the old hairdresser's shop on the ground floor is converted into a bar, called Max & Henry's and run by Maxi and Enrique. In this season, Maxi is come to be seen as a trusted part of the community, being called to for help by many different members of the community. After Javi leaves the post of president in the beginning of the series, Amador takes over the role with Leo remaining as his vice-president. Amador's wife Maite takes the role of \"First Lady\" seriously, and becomes obsessed with her image, splashing out on luxury items in order to look good despite her own family's crippling financial troubles. In addition to these problems, Amador finds out about his wife's previous infidelity with Sergio, which ultimately leads to their faltering marriage, and in turn leads to him being overthrown as President. Antonio takes over the role of president, with his nemesis Enrique drafted in as his second in command, imposing strict regimes but taking swift, often extreme and legally-dubious decisions.\n\n===Season 3 (2009)===\nThis season sees the introduction of several new characters in ''Mirador de Montepinar''. Judith B\u00e9cker, an attractive and successful psychologist, moves into the ''Attic A'' flat. She becomes part of the circle of friends of the younger group of women (Raquel, Nines and Lola) in the building, who develop a somewhat fractious relationship with the other, older group of women in the building; and other residents come to Judy for therapy. Another new arrival is Lola's mother, Estela Reynolds, who comes to live with her daughter and son-in-law. Estela is a former actress and her extremely dramatic, loud, crafty, and lustful nature causes plenty of stress both in Javi and Lola's home as well as in the rest of the building. Another new arrival is Antonio and Nina's baby To\u00f1\u00edn, who arrives into the world via artificial insemination and a complicated web of blackmail, deceit and lies. Coque, now moonlighting as the doorman after replacing Maxi, starts the series as something of a henchman for the power-mad Antonio before running away with the latter's wife Berta, who after feeling neglected by her husband has an affair with him. Antonio is unaware of this affair as he is too busy in his role as President of the Community, obsessing over tracking down the defaulter Germ\u00e1n Palomares. This obsession gets him and his community into an array of predicaments. Enrique starts the season as Antonio's ally, all the while dreaming of the presidency for himself, which Antonio keeps on promising him, without actually handing it over. Amador, meanwhile, is left without a job after being replaced by a pot plant in his bank, and without money, love and a home as his marriage with Maite remains on the rocks.\n\n===Season 4 (2010)===\nThe fourth season starts with a summary of the previous four months, in which Enrique was kidnapped by Germ\u00e1n Palomares, and Coque and Berta lived together in the countryside farming goats. All characters return to Montepinar, and the star-crossed lovers continue their affair. Berta's husband, Antonio, eventually finds out about her affair with Coque when they confess, after months of his investigating and suspecting several other neighbours. At one time he is convinced that Enrique is Berta's lover, and as a result he hires a hitman to kill him, although the hitman ultimately fails. Needless to say, this adds even more tension to the already-frosty relationship between the president and the politician. Enrique starts therapy sessions with Judith in order to get over his memories of the kidnapping and to have someone who listens to him, and the two start a relationship and he proposes to her but she turns him down. Meanwhile, Amador is ordered by the court to pay Maite alimony, and gets a job as a street cleaner, as well as other short-lived jobs, to pay her off and to follow his dream of buying a \"pussy magnet\" motorbike. Raquel and Judith, meanwhile, spend a lot of the season trying to get Maite, who constantly annoys them, out of their group of friends. Estela continues to stir up trouble, and after a brief affair with Leo and others, is eventually kicked out of the house by her own daughter, Lola. A new character, Rosario Parrales, is introduced in this season. He is an illegal immigrant from South America who agrees to pay Amador, who mistook him for a woman when they met on the internet, \u20ac6000 in exchange for his hand in marriage. The sham is easily discovered by the authorities, and the marriage licence isn't granted. Later in the season Rosario is hired to work for Mariscos Recio, and ends the season acting as the president of the community after Antonio is overthrown. In the final episode of the season, Goya is found dead in the kitchen while cooking croquettes, Berta leaves to join a convent, and Antonio, Coque, and Enrique (going under the name \"The A Team\") set off on a caravan trip around Spain together.\n\n===Season 5 (2011)===\nAfter Enrique gets a call from Judith begging him to return. He comes back from his caravan trip with Antonio and Coque to discover that the community is in ruins, with no light and no working lift. Judith, now acting as president, calls on Enrique, her on-off partner, to be her vice-president and get ''Mirador de Montepinar'' out of its crisis. She comes to face plenty more crises, most of which are generated by Antonio in his attempt to undermine the presidency. In the other basement flat across the corridor from Enrique, Amador's overbearing mother, Justi, moves into the flat with him and goes to a lot of trouble to get her son's life and marriage back together, while Amador himself tries hard to get rid of her so he can pursue his life as a playboy. Amador now shares joint custody of the children with Maite, who moves into the flat above him to live with Raquel and Nines. Lola, meanwhile, leaves for Miami to shoot a series, leaving Javi to live with his recently bereaved father. Javi feels jealous and lonely and has to wrestle with his fidelity after Raquel, Judith and Berta all take a liking to him. A new resident is Reyes Ballesteros, who moves into 2\u00baB with her lover, Araceli, who has returned to the community to spend more time with Fran. Her new-found sexuality, mixed with her old feelings with Enrique (they are now still married, but separated), her battle for her son, her absent-mindedness, the homophobic views of some of the community, and her ongoing therapy sessions with Judith, make it difficult for them all to get along. The end result is that Judith and Enrique get married. Parrales, in the meantime, has expanded Mariscos Recio and a new fishmonger's is set up in the commercial area by the flat. Maxi continues being the mastermind of various schemes, and his relationship with his girlfriend, Ana Rosa, a blow-up doll, could be said to be blossoming.\n\n===Season 6 (2012\u201313)===\nThe season begins with the end of Judith's presidency. After a failed round of voting, the occupant of ground floor flat B is randomly selected to succeed Judith. As a result, Araceli, joint owner of the flat with Enrique, takes the helm. Antonio still wants the presidency for himself, and his various attempts to undermine Araceli, including clogging the pipes of the building, are all unsuccessful. Lola is still angry with Raquel due to her supposed infidelity with her husband, Javi and during the first 9 episodes the two do not speak amicably to each other. Javier tries to reconcile with Lola, which he eventually manages to do after the two end up having sex again. A few episodes later, they find out that she is pregnant. In order to fix his marriage, Javi calls on Lola's father, Ferm\u00edn Trujillo, who she has never met. Estela Reynolds, Lola's mother, returns to the series and lives under the same roof as Javi, Lola and Ferm\u00edn. Amador is still trying to get back with Maite, but that hits a snag when she is arrested and spends a brief time in prison for dealing drugs. To make things worse, she must face another problem: she and her husband will be evicted if they are unable to pay off the \u20ac16,800 debt they owe. Naturally, they try to scrape together the money and Amador eventually does so. The bad news for them is that the money arrives a few minutes too late, and his house is put up for auction as a result. He and his family are forced to move out of the downstairs flat, and go back to live in flat 2A where they previously lived. Sergio is another returner to the community; he comes back after having invested all his savings in shady deals and wants to fight for the paternity of his son with Maite, Amador Jr. (nicknamed \"Chicken Eyes\"). Antonio, in the meantime, finds out that he has a long-lost mother. He tries to track her down during the last episodes, and it turns out she was a nun. Violet, his sister, recently released from the mental hospital, comes to live with him and his wife, and is given work in his fishmonger's.\n\n===Season 7 (2013\u201314)===\nThe outgoing president, Araceli, is replaced by her ex-husband, Enrique, who has just returned from Brazil after splitting up with his wife, Judith. Antonio becomes his second-in-command. Judith gives birth to their son Dylan in Chicago, but returns in the middle of the season. Enrique is in the dark about the existence of his son for a long time, but eventually finds out after randomly bumping into his pram in Chicago Airport. This event eventually leads to him being deported back to Spain as a suspected terrorist, and he is soon followed there by Judith and their son, who are refused re-entry into the States due to Enrique's criminal record.\nMeanwhile, there is another new baby in the community, as Lola gives birth to Javi's daughter, but they are unable to come up with a suitable name for a long time until they eventually choose \u00darsula. Lola suffers from great depression, loses her job in her television series, and has to keep on putting up with her parents, Estela and Ferm\u00edn, who are back in love and get married. They temporarily move out of Lola's marital home into the ground-floor flat, whose mortgage is being paid for by Javi and Lola.\nAntonio and Berta also have new marital problems: the long-suffering Berta finally tries to get a divorce from Antonio, with the help of Rebeca Ortiz, a lawyer friend of Judith who looks after her flat while she is in Chicago. Antonio is aware that Berta is entitled to half of all his assets, as she has been financially dependent on him throughout their marriage. To prevent Berta from getting her hands on his fortune, he gives away his assets and tries to manipulate her into settling for less than she is entitled to. First he gives the flat he is leasing to Nines, the mother of his youngest son, and then he gives his seafood company away to his clinically insane sister Violeta. Berta moves in temporarily with Araceli, and the two have a short-lived lesbian affair.\nAmador and Maite continue to have financial woes, losing the flat they were squatting in (2\u00ba A) after it is reclaimed by Edurne, the daughter of recently deceased Izaskun. They are left with no choice but to move into a makeshift house in the garage, shoddily built by them with the help of a few of their neighbours, and their gloom continues. Their children move in too.\nIn addition, Nines and Coque have an affair, Nines gets a job in Max & Henry's, Ferm\u00edn and Estela get their own reality TV series, Antonio and Matthew (an over-sensitive American who is splitting up from Ingrid, Judith's sister) move into Enrique's flat to form the \"Happy Singles\", Rebeca has to deal with her socially inept gynaecologist ex-husband Santiago, and Vicente starts an affair with Pen\u00e9lope, only to find out she is a mass murderer.\n\n===Season 8 (2014\u201315)===\nAmador decides to return to civilization after 6 months in the forest, and will be helped by La Chusa (character who had left in a couple of episodes) a junkie from the slums. Maite leaves the jail and will have to wear a bracelet on her ankle with which she controls her movements and can not leave 1\u00baA, which is where she lives with Raquel, To\u00f1\u00edn, Nines and Coque, who lives there because she is dating Nines. Amador and La Chusa see Carlota, Nano, Rodrigo and Eyes of Chicken in a car. When they find the house of the owners of the car, they are taken away, but Maite and Rebeca inform her that they are her foster family. Amador leaves La Chusa and goes to live in Coque's caravan. Violeta has been admitted to an asylum again. Berta will insist to Antonio to ask for marriage, but this will have problems with Fina, a very problematic old woman who moves to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C who will not stop making life impossible for her neighbors and who, mysteriously, knows everything that has happened in Montepinar . Estela has left Ferm\u00edn for a Russian and Ferm\u00edn will stay with Javi and \u00darsula, the daughter of Javi and Lola, trying to sell the Bajo A. Amador and Maite will try to get work and home to recover their children while Amador tries to conquer Patricia, the social worker who takes the case, without success. Enrique will be the right hand of Maria Teresa, the new mayor, who goes to live with him since her husband, the minister, has put the horns. But for the good of the party, Maria Teresa and her husband are back together. Berta gets Antonio to propose and start organizing the wedding, something that Antonio is not thrilled about. Judith falls in love with Javi but Lola returns to Spain as she has managed to escape from the guerrillas. The bad thing is that Amador, Leo, Vicente, Javi and Ferm\u00edn had gone to Colombia to rescue her, but they manage to return. Javi will be very angry with Lola. Maria Teresa returns with Enrique and they begin a relationship. La Chusa plays the Christmas lottery and rents the Bajo A and begins a relationship with Ferm\u00edn. Maite writes an erotic novel based on the romances of Mirador de Montepinar. Berta will go to a spa at her bachelorette party with the girls in the building and she will meet Araceli with whom she is about to go to bed when the owner of the spa (Araceli's girlfriend) sees them.

Otto's mother died when he was two years old, and the family then moved to [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]].  In May 1900, Kuusinen graduated from the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 [[Lyceum#Finland|Lyceum]] and entered [[Helsinki University]] the same year. His main subjects were [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], and [[art history]]. Kuusinen was an active member of the students' union, and during this period he was interested in [[Finnish Party|Fennoman conservatism]] and [[Santeri Alkio|Alkioism]]. In 1902, Kuusinen graduated as a [[Candidate of Philosophy]].\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Civil War and flight to the Soviet Union ===\n<!-- a gap here: life from student to politician -->\nIn 1906, after toppling the more moderate party chairman J. K. Kari, Kuusinen came to dominate [[Finland's Social Democratic Party]]. He was a member of [[Eduskunta|Finland's Parliament]] from 1908 to 1910, from 1911 to 1913 and again from 1916 to 1918 as well as the party's chairman from 1911 to 1917. He was a leader of the January 1918 revolution in Finland that created the short-lived [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], of which he was appointed People's Commissar of Education.<ref name=Brodyetal /> After the republic was defeated in the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, Kuusinen fled to [[Moscow]] and helped form the [[Finnish Communist Party]].\n\nKuusinen continued his work as a prominent leader of the [[Comintern]] in Bolshevist Russia, that soon became the [[Soviet Union]]. Kuusinen also became a leader in [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|Soviet military intelligence]], establishing an intelligence network against the Scandinavian countries.<ref>[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov6/03.html Chapter 3. A History of Spetsnaz] Spetsnaz. The Story Behind the Soviet SAS, {{ISBN|978-0-241-11961-7}}</ref> In Finland, a more moderate faction rehabilitated the Social Democrats under [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner]]'s leadership. Meanwhile, Kuusinen and other radicals were increasingly seen as responsible for the Civil War and its aftermath.\n\nAnimosity towards socialists in Finland in the decades after the civil war prompted many Finns to emigrate to Russia to \"build socialism.\" However, the Soviet [[Great Purge]] was a hard blow to Finns in the Soviet Union.  Many Finnish communists sympathetic to Trotskyism or social-democracy were purged and Kuusinen's reputation in Finland was damaged when he turned out to be one of the very few not targeted by Stalinist [[show trial]]s, deportations, and executions.\n\n=== Head of the Terijoki Government ===\n[[File:Terijokipakten.jpg|thumb|right|The Soviet leadership signed a treaty with the [[Finnish Democratic Republic]].

Otto's mother died when he was two years old, and the family then moved to [[Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4]].  In May 1900, Kuusinen graduated from the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 [[Lyceum#Finland|Lyceum]] and entered [[Helsinki University]] the same year. His main subjects were [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], and [[art history]]. Kuusinen was an active member of the students' union, and during this period he was interested in [[Finnish Party|Fennoman conservatism]] and [[Santeri Alkio|Alkioism]]. In 1902, Kuusinen graduated as a [[Candidate of Philosophy]].\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Civil War and flight to the Soviet Union ===\n<!-- a gap here: life from student to politician -->\nIn 1906, after toppling the more moderate party chairman J. K. Kari, Kuusinen came to dominate [[Finland's Social Democratic Party]]. He was a member of [[Eduskunta|Finland's Parliament]] from 1908 to 1910, from 1911 to 1913 and again from 1916 to 1918 as well as the party's chairman from 1911 to 1917. He was a leader of the January 1918 revolution in Finland that created the short-lived [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic]], of which he was appointed People's Commissar of Education.<ref name=Brodyetal /> After the republic was defeated in the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, Kuusinen fled to [[Moscow]] and helped form the [[Finnish Communist Party]].\n\nKuusinen continued his work as a prominent leader of the [[Comintern]] in Bolshevist Russia, that soon became the [[Soviet Union]]. Kuusinen also became a leader in [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|Soviet military intelligence]], establishing an intelligence network against the Scandinavian countries.<ref>[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov6/03.html Chapter 3.

Meanwhile, Kuusinen and other radicals were increasingly seen as responsible for the Civil War and its aftermath.\n\nAnimosity towards socialists in Finland in the decades after the civil war prompted many Finns to emigrate to Russia to \"build socialism.\" However, the Soviet [[Great Purge]] was a hard blow to Finns in the Soviet Union.  Many Finnish communists sympathetic to Trotskyism or social-democracy were purged and Kuusinen's reputation in Finland was damaged when he turned out to be one of the very few not targeted by Stalinist [[show trial]]s, deportations, and executions.\n\n=== Head of the Terijoki Government ===\n[[File:Terijokipakten.jpg|thumb|right|The Soviet leadership signed a treaty with the [[Finnish Democratic Republic]].
