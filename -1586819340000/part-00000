It was created by [[Gjon Kastrioti]] and then ruled by the national hero of Albania, [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]]. It can be also called the Principality of Albania since it's rulers held the tittle Dominus Albaniae (\"Lord of Albania\").<ref name=Anamali2002p379>{{harvnb|Anamali|2002|p=379}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\n[[Gjon Kastrioti]] had originally only two small villages. In short time John Kastrioti managed to expand its lands so as to become the undisputed lord of Central Albania.\nHe married [[Voisava Tripalda]] who bore five daughters - Mara, later wife of [[Stefan Crnojevi\u0107]] of Montenegro; Jela, then wife of Gjin (Gino) Musacchio; Angjelina (Angelina), later wife of [[Vladan Arianit Comnenus Thopia]]; Vlajka, later wife of [[Stefan Maramonte Bal\u0161i\u0107]]; Mamica, later wife of [[Karol Musacchio Thopia]] - and four sons: Repo\u0161, Stani\u0161a (Stanislaus), Kostandin (Constantine) and [[George Kastrioti]]. [[Gjon Kastrioti]] was among those who opposed<ref name=\"Tennent1845\">[[James Emerson Tennent]], 1845, ''The History of Modern Greece, from Its Conquest by the Romans B.C.146, to the Present Time''</ref> the early incursion of Ottoman [[Bayezid I]], however his resistance was ineffectual. The Sultan, having accepted his submissions, obliged him to pay tribute and to ensure the fidelity of local rulers, George Kastrioti and his three brothers were taken by the Sultan to his court as hostages. After his conversion to [[Islam]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Rendina|first=Claudio|title=La grande enciclopedia di Roma|page=1136|publisher=Newton Compton|location=Rome|year=2000|isbn=88-8289-316-2}}</ref> the young George Kastrioti attended military school in [[Edirne]] and led many battles for the [[Ottoman Empire]] to victory. For his military victories, he received the title ''Arnavutlu \u0130skender [[Bey]]'', ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Sk\u00ebnderbe shqiptari'', English: ''Lord Alexander, the Albanian'') comparing Kastrioti's military brilliance to that of [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n==Restoration of Gjergj Kastrioti==\nHe was distinguished as one of the best officers in several Ottoman campaigns both in Asia Minor and in Europe, and the Sultan appointed him General. He even fought against [[Greeks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]], and some sources say that he used to maintain secret links with [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Ladislaus Posthumus of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus V]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]].<ref name=\"Noli\">[[Fan S. Noli|Noli, Fan S.]]: ''George Castrioti Scanderbeg'', New York, 1947</ref> Sultan Murat II gave him the title [[W\u0101li|Vali]] which made him General Governor.\nOn November 28, 1443, Skanderbeg saw his opportunity to rebel after a [[Battle of Ni\u0161 (1443)|battle]] against the Hungarians led by [[John Hunyadi]] in [[Ni\u0161]] as part of the [[Crusade of Varna]]. He switched sides along with 300 other Albanians serving in the Ottoman army. After a long trek to Albania he eventually captured Kruj\u00eb by forging a letter<ref name=\"Tennent1845\"\n/> from the Sultan to the Governor of Kruj\u00eb, which granted him control of the territory. After capturing the castle, Skanderbeg<ref name=\"gibbon\">[[Edward Gibbon]], 1788, ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=b8ETAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#PPA462,M1Scanderbeg Volume 6, Scanderbeg section]</ref> abjured Islam and proclaimed himself the avenger of his family and country. He raised a flag showing a double-headed eagle, an ancient symbol used by various cultures of Balkans (especially the Byzantine Empire), which later became the [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]].

With this support, Skanderbeg built fortresses and organized a mobile defense force that forced the Ottomans to disperse their troops, leaving them vulnerable to the hit-and-run tactics of the Albanians.<ref name=\"Stavrianos\">{{cite book|first=L.S.|last=Stavrianos|year=2000|title=The Balkans Since 1453|isbn=1-85065-551-0}}</ref> He managed to create the [[League of Lezha]], a federation of all [[Albanian Principalities]].The main members of the league were the Arianiti, Bal\u0161i\u0107, Dukagjini,Muzaka, Spani, Thopia and Crnojevi\u0107i.

This city was particularly symbolic to Skanderbeg because he had been appointed suba of Kruja in 1438 by the Ottomans. The fighting lasted four months and over one thousand Albanians lost their lives while over 20,000 Ottomans died in battle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shqiptar\u00ebt: Historia e popullit shqiptar nga lasht\u00ebsia deri n\u00eb dit\u00ebt e sotme|last=Jacques|first=Edwin|publisher=Trans.

Skanderbeg's death in 1468 did not end the struggle for independence, and fighting continued until 1481, under [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]], when the Albanian lands were forced to succumb to the Ottoman armies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[House of Kastrioti]]\n* [[League of Lezh\u00eb]]\n* [[Albanian principalities]]\n* [[History of Albania]]\n\n==References==\n\"History of Albanian People\" Albanian Academy of Science. {{ISBN|99927-1-623-1}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{Medieval Albanian Principalities}}\n\n{{coord missing|Albania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Principality Of Kastrioti}}\n[[Category:1444 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1389]]\n[[Category:Albanian principalities]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A principality of medieval Albania}}\n{{Disputed|date=June 2011}}\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = Principata e Kastriotit \n|conventional_long_name = Principality of Kastrioti<br>Principality of Albania\n|common_name            = Kastrioti\n|\n|era                    = Medieval\n|status                 = Principality\n|status_text            = <!--- A free text to describe status the top of the infobox.

It was created by [[Gjon Kastrioti]] and then ruled by the national hero of Albania, [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]].\n\n==Formation==\n[[Gjon Kastrioti]] had originally only two small villages. In short time John Kastrioti managed to expand its lands so as to become the undisputed lord of Central Albania.\nHe married [[Voisava Tripalda]] who bore five daughters - Mara, later wife of [[Stefan Crnojevi\u0107]] of Montenegro; Jela, then wife of Gjin (Gino) Musacchio; Angjelina (Angelina), later wife of [[Vladan Arianit Comnenus Thopia]]; Vlajka, later wife of [[Stefan Maramonte Bal\u0161i\u0107]]; Mamica, later wife of [[Karol Musacchio Thopia]] - and four sons: Repo\u0161, Stani\u0161a (Stanislaus), Kostandin (Constantine) and [[George Kastrioti]]. [[Gjon Kastrioti]] was among those who opposed<ref name=\"Tennent1845\">[[James Emerson Tennent]], 1845, ''The History of Modern Greece, from Its Conquest by the Romans B.C.146, to the Present Time''</ref> the early incursion of Ottoman [[Bayezid I]], however his resistance was ineffectual. The Sultan, having accepted his submissions, obliged him to pay tribute and to ensure the fidelity of local rulers, George Kastrioti and his three brothers were taken by the Sultan to his court as hostages. After his conversion to [[Islam]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Rendina|first=Claudio|title=La grande enciclopedia di Roma|page=1136|publisher=Newton Compton|location=Rome|year=2000|isbn=88-8289-316-2}}</ref> the young George Kastrioti attended military school in [[Edirne]] and led many battles for the [[Ottoman Empire]] to victory. For his military victories, he received the title ''Arnavutlu \u0130skender [[Bey]]'', ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Sk\u00ebnderbe shqiptari'', English: ''Lord Alexander, the Albanian'') comparing Kastrioti's military brilliance to that of [[Alexander the Great]].\n\n==Restoration of Gjergj Kastrioti==\nHe was distinguished as one of the best officers in several Ottoman campaigns both in Asia Minor and in Europe, and the Sultan appointed him General. He even fought against [[Greeks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Hungarians]], and some sources say that he used to maintain secret links with [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Ladislaus Posthumus of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus V]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]].<ref name=\"Noli\">[[Fan S. Noli|Noli, Fan S.]]: ''George Castrioti Scanderbeg'', New York, 1947</ref> Sultan Murat II gave him the title [[W\u0101li|Vali]] which made him General Governor.\nOn November 28, 1443, Skanderbeg saw his opportunity to rebel after a [[Battle of Ni\u0161 (1443)|battle]] against the Hungarians led by [[John Hunyadi]] in [[Ni\u0161]] as part of the [[Crusade of Varna]]. He switched sides along with 300 other Albanians serving in the Ottoman army. After a long trek to Albania he eventually captured Kruj\u00eb by forging a letter<ref name=\"Tennent1845\"\n/> from the Sultan to the Governor of Kruj\u00eb, which granted him control of the territory.

He raised a flag showing a double-headed eagle, an ancient symbol used by various cultures of Balkans (especially the Byzantine Empire), which later became the [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]].

The fighting lasted four months and over one thousand Albanians lost their lives while over 20,000 Ottomans died in battle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shqiptar\u00ebt: Historia e popullit shqiptar nga lasht\u00ebsia deri n\u00eb dit\u00ebt e sotme|last=Jacques|first=Edwin|publisher=Trans.

Skanderbeg's death in 1468 did not end the struggle for independence, and fighting continued until 1481, under [[Lek\u00eb Dukagjini]], when the Albanian lands were forced to succumb to the Ottoman armies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[House of Kastrioti]]\n* [[League of Lezh\u00eb]]\n* [[Albanian principalities]]\n* [[History of Albania]]\n\n==References==\n\"History of Albanian People\" Albanian Academy of Science. {{ISBN|99927-1-623-1}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{Medieval Albanian Principalities}}\n\n{{coord missing|Albania}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Principality Of Kastrioti}}\n[[Category:1444 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1389]]\n[[Category:Albanian principalities]]\n", "name_user": "Zorzi Kastrioti", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Kastrioti"}

with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]], ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]''.  The song was written earlier, and a different version was originally considered for Young's 1968 solo debut album ''[[Neil Young (album)|Neil Young]]''\n\n==Lyrics and music==\nThe lyrics of \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" describe Young's disillusionment with the music scene in Los Angeles.<ref name=journey>{{cite book|title=Journey Through the Past: The Stories Behind the Classic Songs of Neil Young|author=Williamson, N.|page=28|year=2002|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=9780879307417}}</ref> ''[[Allmusic]]'' critic Matthew Greenwald describes it as \"a cry from a man that is in need of settling down after a hair-raising experience.\"<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|title=Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere|author=Greenwald, Matthew|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2020-02-29|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/everybody-knows-this-is-nowhere-mt0010742681}}</ref>  This is reflected in lyrics such as \"I gotta get away from this day-to-day running around\" and \"I think I'd like to go back home and take it easy.\"<ref name=journey/>  Music lecturer Ken Bielen interprets the lyrics as suggesting that when the singer obtained what he originally wanted, possibly fame and success, he found them to be \"nowhere.\"<ref name=words/>\n\nThe music of \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" has a country rock flavor.<ref name=journey/><ref name=words/><ref name=complete/>  Young biographer [[David Downing]] describes it as \"stripped\u2013down foot\u2013stomping rock.<ref name=dreamer/>  ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' contributor Mark Richardson describes it as \"a brash, rollicking country-rocker in the vein of [[the Band]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young|author=Richardson,

Young biographer Jimmy McDonough hears an echo of [[Del Shannon]]'s 1962 song \"[[The Swiss Maid]]\" in the music of \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.\"<ref name=shakey/>\n\nYoung and Crazy Horse guitarist [[Danny Whitten]] shared the vocals.<ref name=ultimate>{{cite news|title=Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere|author=Gill, Andy|newspaper=The Ultimate Music Guide: Neil Young|page=12|year=2017|publisher=Uncut}}</ref>  The recording of the vocals eschewed using a [[mixing board]], and these were recorded directly to tape.<ref name=shakey/>  According to Young, this  was done in an effort \"to get all the bullshit out.\"<ref name=shakey/>  Young liked the \"edge\" produced by the resulting [[Impedance matching|impedance mismatch]], which he thought produced a \"spitty-sounding\" vocal.<ref name=shakey/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nMusic critic [[Johnny Rogan]] describes \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" as an \"interesting, albeit slight composition,\" describing the [[harmony|harmonies]] as \"both attractive and whimsical.\"<ref name=complete>{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to the Music of Neil Young|page=18|author=[[Johnny Rogan|Rogan, Johnny]]|year=1996|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0711953994}}</ref>  According to Greenwald, the \"Western-influenced melody\" and Crazy Horse's playing reflect the theme of appreciating simple country life \"perfectly.\"<ref name=allmusic/>  According to ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' author Andy Gill, \"the burly country twang of the astringent guitar [[riff (music)|riff]], tempered by the poignant, sardonic tone of the 'sha-la-la' backing, combine to offer an intriguingly tart take on the new country-rock sound that was miles from the psychedelicized retro-purism of [[The Byrds]] and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers|Burritos]], and the saccharine sweetness of [[Crosby, Stills and Nash|CS&N]].<ref name=ultimate/>  McDonough regards this \"compact, country-tinged\" song as representing one of the archetypes of the Crazy Horse sound.<ref name=shakey/>  The editors of ''[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' described it as \"incisive guitar rock.\"<ref name=rs>{{cite book|title=Neil Young|chapter=The 100 Greatest Songs|page=88|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nYoung originally recorded \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" for his 1968 solo debut album ''[[Neil Young]]'' in a very  different arrangement.<ref name=shakey/>  Rather than Crazy Horses' rock arrangement, the version recorded for ''Neil Young'' was backed by [[woodwind]] instruments.<ref name=journey/>  Downing describes this version as sounding \"pretty but passive\" with \"wistful vocal, beautifully layered guitars, [[string instruments|strings]] and flute solo.<ref

complete with a rooty-toot-toot [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] solo.<ref name=shakey/>  According to Downing, the rock version released on ''Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere'' loses none of the original versions's meaning.<ref name=dreamer/>  A version of the song without Crazy Horse was released as a promotional single in March 1969.<ref name=journey/>\n\n[[Dar Williams]] covered the song on her

The school is a member of [[Conservatoires UK]], the [[European Association of Conservatoires]] and the Federation of Drama Schools. It also has formed a creative alliance with its neighbours, the [[Barbican Centre]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Notable alumni of the school include: [[Bryn Terfel|Sir Bryn Terfel]], [[James Galway|Sir James Galway]], [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Ewan McGregor]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1880\u20131977===\nThe Guildhall School of Music first opened its doors on 27 September 1880, housed in a disused warehouse in the City of London. With 64 part-time students, it was the first municipal music college in Great Britain. The school quickly outgrew its first home, however, and in 1887 it moved to new premises in John Carpenter Street in a complex of educational buildings built by the Corporation of London to house it and the City's two [[state school]]s.\n\nThe new building was completed by 9 December 1886 and the [[Lord Mayor of London]], [[Reginald Hanson|Sir Reginald Hanson]], attended the opening ceremony. Teaching continued under the first principal of the school, Thomas Henry Weist Hill, who eventually had some ninety teaching staff.\n\n[[File:London barbican 18.JPG|thumb|295px|Guildhall School inside the Barbican Estate]]\nThe new site, designed by the architect [[Horace Jones (architect)|Sir Horace Jones]], comprised a common room for professors and 45 studios, each surrounded by a one-foot thick layer of concrete to \"deaden the sound\". Each room contained both a [[Piano|grand piano]] and an [[Piano|upright piano]]. Additionally, there was an organ room and a \"practice\" room, in reality a small concert hall which was used for orchestral and choir rehearsals. The practice room was also the venue for the fortnightly school concerts\n\nInitially, all tuition was on a part-time basis, but full-time courses were introduced to meet demand in 1920. Departments of speech, voice, and acting were added, and by 1935 the school had added \"and Drama\" to its title.\n\n===1977\u20132005===\nThe school moved to its present premises in the heart of the City of London's [[Barbican Centre]] in 1977 and continues to be owned, funded and administered by the City of London.\n\nIn 1993 the Corporation of London leased a nearby courtyard of buildings that in the 18th century had been the centre of [[Samuel Whitbread (1720\u20131796)|Samuel Whitbread]]'s first brewery, and renovated and converted this to provide the school with its hall of residence, [[Sundial Court]].<ref name=\"Sundial Court Summer Lettings\">{{cite web|title=Sundial Court Summer Lettings|url=https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/about_the_school/shared_left_nav/life_at_the_school/accommodation/sundial_court/|website=GUILDHALL SCHOOL|accessdate=21 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144839/https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/about_the_school/shared_left_nav/life_at_the_school/accommodation/sundial_court/|archivedate=21 September 2017}}</ref> About three minutes' walk from the school, Sundial Court offers self-catering single-room accommodation for 178 students.\n\nIn 2001 the Secretary of State, [[Baroness Blackstone]], announced that the Barbican Centre, including the Guildhall School, was to be Grade II listed.\n\n===2005-present===\n[[File:Milton Court from Outside.jpg|thumb|295px|Guildhall's Milton Court building from outside]]\nIn 2005 the school was awarded the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for its development and outreach programme, Guildhall Connect,<ref>Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (UK Branch). 2018-06-30.

With 64 part-time students, it was the first municipal music college in Great Britain. The school quickly outgrew its first home, however, and in 1887 it moved to new premises in John Carpenter Street in a complex of educational buildings built by the Corporation of London to house it and the City's two [[state school]]s.\n\nThe new building was completed by 9 December 1886 and the [[Lord Mayor of London]], [[Reginald Hanson|Sir Reginald Hanson]], attended the opening ceremony. Teaching continued under the first principal of the school, Thomas Henry Weist Hill, who eventually had some ninety teaching staff.\n\n[[File:London barbican 18.JPG|thumb|295px|Guildhall School inside the Barbican Estate]]\nThe new site, designed by the architect [[Horace Jones (architect)|Sir Horace Jones]], comprised a common room for professors and 45 studios, each surrounded by a one-foot thick layer of concrete to \"deaden the sound\". Each room contained both a [[Piano|grand piano]] and an [[Piano|upright piano]]. Additionally, there was an organ room and a \"practice\" room, in reality a small concert hall which was used for orchestral and choir rehearsals. The practice room was also the venue for the fortnightly school concerts\n\nInitially, all tuition was on a part-time basis, but full-time courses were introduced to meet demand in 1920. Departments of speech, voice, and acting were added, and by 1935 the school had added \"and Drama\" to its title.\n\n===1977\u20132005===\nThe school moved to its present premises in the heart of the City of London's [[Barbican Centre]] in 1977 and continues to be owned, funded and administered by the City of London.\n\nIn 1993 the Corporation of London leased a nearby courtyard of buildings that in the 18th century had been the centre of [[Samuel Whitbread (1720\u20131796)|Samuel Whitbread]]'s first brewery, and renovated and converted this to provide the school with its hall of residence, [[Sundial Court]].<ref name=\"Sundial Court Summer Lettings\">{{cite web|title=Sundial Court Summer Lettings|url=https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/about_the_school/shared_left_nav/life_at_the_school/accommodation/sundial_court/|website=GUILDHALL SCHOOL|accessdate=21 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144839/https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/about_the_school/shared_left_nav/life_at_the_school/accommodation/sundial_court/|archivedate=21 September 2017}}</ref> About three minutes' walk from the school, Sundial Court offers self-catering single-room accommodation for 178 students.\n\nIn 2001 the Secretary of State, [[Baroness Blackstone]], announced that the Barbican Centre, including the Guildhall School, was to be Grade II listed.\n\n===2005-Present===\n[[File:Milton Court from Outside.jpg|thumb|295px|Guildhall's Milton Court building from outside]]\nIn 2005 the school was awarded the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for its development and outreach programme, Guildhall Connect,<ref>Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (UK Branch). 2018-06-30.
