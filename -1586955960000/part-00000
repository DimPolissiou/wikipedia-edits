They used the water of cannoli for all purposes except drinking. The main dependence of the coastal settlers was for bathing and washing clothes. Fishing was also active in small ponds. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mathrubhumi.com/thrissur/malayalam-news/canoli-canal-revive-thrissur-1.2818703|title= \u0d2a\u0d41\u0d28\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d\u0d1c\u0d28\u0d3f \u0d24\u0d47\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d28 \u0d15\u0d28\u0d4b\u0d32\u0d3f|}}</ref>.

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.\n<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev, Lev N., Lemanskii, Aleksander A. |first1=. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 [in Russian] |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].

The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />\n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]].

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems to each other with changing sign of the magnetic component. (In scalar problem, potentials are equal on the surface when their derivatives are differed by sign.)   In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scattering of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babinet's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics and for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions as a solution of the problem is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916-920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 |url=https://www.link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01031726 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234-238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru_1979_ 234-238.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]].

Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball of radius <math> a </math>. Adjunct space has the same Schwarzschild metrics. In that case, well known singularity <math> R =0 </math>  is disappeared.\n\n===Black-body of arbitrary form===\n[[Anechoic chamber|Non-reflecting chamber]] has absolutely absorbing walls.

Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface.

Normal <math> n_y </math> is directed outside of chamber i.e. in side of convexity of surface. Vector <math> \\mathbf x </math> lays on the surface.\n\nBoundary condition for convex black-body (for example ball) differes by sign of first item in the integral as far as  derivative changes sign on the surface for going from physical space to adjunct one. \nNormal is directed outside of black-body.\n\nAt last, boundary condition for arbitrary surface, containing convex  and concave  parts, conserves its form under requirement that first sign is (+) for convex part and sign (-) for concave that. \n\n==Realizations==\nA ''realization'' of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01950 Viney Ghai, Harpreet Singh, and Prabhat K.

The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the diameter of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.\n<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev, Lev N., Lemanskii, Aleksander A. |first1=. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 [in Russian] |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].

The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />\n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]]. Therefore, the problem is got to be spacious  instead of surface one. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sommerfeld |first1=Arnold |title=Theoretishes \u00fcber die Beugung der R\u00f6ntgen Strahlen |journal=Zeitchrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik- Wikisource |date=1901 |volume=Band 46 |pages=ss.11-97 |url=http://de.wikisource.org>wiki>Zeitschrift_f\u00fcr_Ma }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe idea to continue physical space was developed later.

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems to each other with changing sign of the magnetic component. (In scalar problem, potentials are equal on the surface when their derivatives are differed by sign.)   In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scattering of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babinet's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics and for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions as a solution of the problem is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916-920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 |url=https://www.link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01031726 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234-238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru_1979_ 234-238.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]]. The famous [[Schwarzschild metric]] looks mathematically  simple:\n:<math>\\mathbf - \\,  \\frac{\\left (1-\\frac{r_s}{4R}\\right)^2}{\\left (1+\\frac{r_s}{4R}\\right )^2}dt^2 + \\left (1+\\frac{r_s}{4R}\\right)^4 (dx^2+dy^2+dz^2)</math>,\nwhere <math>\\mathbf R = (x,y,z) </math> is radius-vector, <math> r_s  </math> is  [[Schwarzschild metric|the Schwarzschild]] radius i.e. radius of black-hole. \nFrom  point of view of concept based on the adjunct space , it is useful to apply the following transformation  of physical space:<ref name=\"Efimov\"/>\n:<math> \\boldsymbol \\rho = \\frac{ a^2\\mathbf R}{R^2} </math>,\nwhere <math> a </math> is radius of sphere that adjunct space is attached to. As to be known, it is [[Inversion in a sphere|inversion in sphere]].  Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball of radius <math> a </math>. Adjunct space has the same Schwarzschild metrics. In that case, well known singularity <math> R =0 </math>  is disappeared. \n\n===Black-body of arbitrary form===\n[[Anechoic chamber|Non-reflecting chamber]] has absolutely absorbing walls. Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton, J.A., Chu, L.J. |title=Diffraction Theory of Electromagnetic Waves |journal=Physical Review, Am.

Fields on the surface are bound by [[Green's function]] in two points - <math>\\mathbf x</math> and <math>\\mathbf y </math>:\n:<math> G(\\mathbf {x,y}) = \\frac{\\exp (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid})}{4 \\pi \\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid} }.    </math>\nLet be charges (or radiation sources) are placed in non-reflecting chamber i.e. in free space. Green's formula defines field <math> u(\\mathbf x) </math> in adjunct space by boundary values on the surface of non-reflecting chamber. Upon sending argument <math>\\mathbf x</math> on the surface, formula gives boundary condition:\n:<math> \\frac {u(\\mathbf x)}{2}= \\iint\\limits_{S,\\, y \\neq x    }\\left[ {\\mathbf - \\, G(\\mathbf{x,y})\\frac { \\partial u(\\mathbf y)}{\\partial n_y} +u(\\mathbf y) \\frac{\\partial G(\\mathbf{x,y)}  }{\\partial n_y  }       }\\right]        \\,dS_y   .</math>\n\nThe [[surface integral]]    is calculated in the sense of [[Hadamard regularization]]. Normal <math> n_y </math> is directed outside of chamber i.e. in side of convexity of surface. Vector <math> \\mathbf x </math> lays on the surface.\n\nBoundary condition for convex black-body (for example ball) differes by sign of first item in the integral as far as  derivative changes sign on the surface for going from physical space to adjunct one. \nNormal is directed outside of black-body.\n\nAt last, boundary condition for arbitrary surface, containing convex  and concave  parts, conserves its form under requirement that first sign is (+) for convex part and sign (-) for concave that. \n\n==Realizations==\nA ''realization'' of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01950 Viney Ghai, Harpreet Singh, and Prabhat K. Agnihotri, ''Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces,'' ACS Applied Nano Particles]</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the diameter of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].

Then the mature mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it is translated. The polypeptide chain then folds and is post-translationally modified.]]\n\n'''Protein biosynthesis''' (or '''protein synthesis''') is a core biological process, occurring inside [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[homeostasis|balancing]] the loss of cellular [[protein]]s (via [[Proteolysis|degradation]] or [[Protein targeting|export]]) through the production of new proteins. Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme]]s, structural proteins or [[hormone]]s and therefore, are crucial biological components. As a result, protein synthesis is regulated at multiple steps <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=  Sixth}}</ref>. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are some distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule [[messenger RNA]] by enzymes - called [[RNA polymerases]] - in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form which undergoes processing and modification through post-transcriptional modifications. The now mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The amino acids are joined together by [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, a protein must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]] required to function as an enzyme. In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease, as changes and errors in this process through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Nucleotide structure within a polynucleotide chain.png\n | alt1 = Shows the structure of \n | caption1 = Illustrate the structure of a nucleotide with the 5 carbons labelled demonstrating the 5' nature of the phosphate group and 3' nature of hydroxyl group needed to form the connective phosphodiester bonds\n | image2 = Directionality of DNA molecule.png\n | alt2 = Shows the two polynucleotide strands within the DNA molecule joined by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs.

DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

This directionality is because the underlying nucleotide subunits are asymmetrical with a phosphate group on one side of the pentose sugar and a base on the other. The five carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered from 1' (where ' means prime) to 5'. The phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides are formed by joining the hydroxyl group of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of another nucleotide. Based on the carbon numbers, the phosphate group of the nucleotide is said to be 5' and the oxygen which links to the next nucleotide is termed 3\". Hence, one strand of DNA runs in a 5' to 3' direction and the complementary DNA strand runs in the opposite direction from 3' to 5' <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>. \n\n[[File:Process of DNA transcription.png|300px|thumb|Illustrates the conversion of the template strand of DNA to the pre-mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase.]]\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene at the 3' end to the 5' end of the gene. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA in the 5'-to-3' direction. RNA polymerase catalyses the formation of [[phosphodiester bonds]] between nucleotides capable of complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of nucleotides to the growing polynucleotide chain by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand. Behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

RNA polymerase builds the pre-mRNA molecule at a rate of 20 nucleotides per second enabling the production of thousands of pre-mRNA molecules from the same gene in an hour.

However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of 4 bases - [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] (G, C, A and T) - RNA is also composed of 4 bases - guanine, cytosine, adenine and [[uracil]]. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil which is able to base pair with adenine. Therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil <ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

These distinct 5' and 3' mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is present and intact, if both the 5' cap and 3' tail are present <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThis processed pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon]]s, introns are nucleotide sequences within the gene that do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences which directly encode a protein.

The ribosome moves along the mature mRNA molecule incorporating tRNA and producing a polypeptide chain.]] \n\nTranslation is the process of synthesising an amino acid polypeptide chain from the mRNA template molecule. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of a polypeptide chain folding from its initial primary structure through to the quaternary structure.]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm <ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref>.

Examples of processes which add chemical groups to the target protein include [[Protein methylation|methylation]], [[Protein acetylation|acetylation]] and [[Protein phosphorylation|phosphorylation]].\n\nMethylation is the reversible addition of a [[methyl group]] onto an amino acid catalysed by an enzyme known as a [[methyltransferase]]. Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. One example of a protein which is commonly methylated is a [[histone]], DNA is wrapped around histones in the nucleus, a highly specific pattern of [[histone methylation]] is used to control gene transcription in the nucleus <ref name=\"Murn 2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Murn |first1=Jernej |last2=Shi |first2=Yang |title=The winding path of protein methylation research: milestones and new frontiers |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=517\u2013527 |doi=10.1038/nrm.2017.35}}</ref>.\n\nHistone-based regulation of gene transcription is also modified by acetylation.

Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]]. The phosphate group is removed from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by a protein [[kinase]] and transferred onto the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] group of the target amino acid, this produces [[adenosine diphosphate]] as a byproduct. This processed can be reversed and the phosphate group removed by a protein [[phosphatase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex or can alter the level of protein activity <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>.\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right).]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding or malfunctioning. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n===Sickle Cell Disease===\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia illustrating the different red blood cell shapes and differing blood flow within blood vessels.]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is the single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref> which changes codon 6 from encoding glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\"/>.\n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are some distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule [[messenger RNA]] by enzymes - called [[RNA polymerases]] - in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form which undergoes processing and modification through post-transcriptional modifications. The now mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The amino acids are joined together by [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, a protein must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]] required to function as an enzyme. In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease, as changes and errors in this process through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

This directionality is because the underlying nucleotide subunits are asymmetrical with a phosphate group on one side of the pentose sugar and a base on the other. The five carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered from 1' (where ' means prime) to 5'. The phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides are formed by joining the hydroxyl group of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of another nucleotide. Based on the carbon numbers, the phosphate group of the nucleotide is said to be 5' and the oxygen which links to the next nucleotide is termed 3\". Hence, one strand of DNA runs in a 5' to 3' direction and the complementary DNA strand runs in the opposite direction from 3' to 5' <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>. \n\n[[File:Process of DNA transcription.png|300px|thumb|Illustrates the conversion of the template strand of DNA to the pre-mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase.]]\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene at the 3' end to the 5' end of the gene. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA in the 5'-to-3' direction. RNA polymerase catalyses the formation of [[phosphodiester bonds]] between nucleotides capable of complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of nucleotides to the growing polynucleotide chain by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand. Behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

RNA polymerase builds the pre-mRNA molecule at a rate of 20 nucleotides per second enabling the production of thousands of pre-mRNA molecules from the same gene in an hour. Despite the fast rate of synthesis, the RNA polymerase enzyme has its own proofreading mechanism which allows it to remove incorrect nucleotides (which are not complementary to the template strand of DNA) from the growing pre-mRNA molecule through an excision reaction <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThe pre-mRNA molecule synthesised is complementary in sequence to the template DNA strand and shares the same nucleotide sequence as the coding DNA strand. However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of 4 bases - [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] (G, C, A and T) - RNA is also composed of 4 bases - guanine, cytosine, adenine and [[uracil]]. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil which is able to base pair with adenine. Therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil <ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

These distinct 5' and 3' mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is present and intact, if both the 5' cap and 3' tail are present <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThis processed pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon]]s, introns are nucleotide sequences within the gene that do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences which directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule, therefore, in order to produce an mature mRNA molecule encoding a protein,  splicing must occur <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

The ribosome moves along the mature mRNA molecule incorporating tRNA and producing a polypeptide chain.]] \n\nTranslation is the process of synthesising an amino acid polypeptide chain from the mRNA template molecule. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain <ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>. In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule. There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref>.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>.\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains <ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of a polypeptide chain folding from its initial primary structure through to the quaternary structure.]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm <ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref>.

Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids [[lysine]] and [[arginine]].

Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]]. The phosphate group is removed from [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by a protein [[kinase]] and transferred onto the [[hydroxy|hydroxyl]] group of the target amino acid, this produces [[adenosine diphosphate]] as a byproduct. This processed can be reversed and the phosphate group removed by a protein [[phosphatase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex or can alter the level of protein activity <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>.\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]] <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right).]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding or malfunctioning. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n===Sickle Cell Disease===\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia illustrating the different red blood cell shapes and differing blood flow within blood vessels.]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref>. Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anaemia, the most common missense mutation is the single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the haemoglobin B subunit gene <ref name=\"StatPearls 2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Mangla |first1=Ankit |last2=Ehsan |first2=Moavia |last3=Maruvada |first3=Smita |title=Sickle Cell Anemia |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482164/ |website=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |accessdate=12 March 2020 |date=2020|pmid=29489205 }}</ref> which changes codon 6 from encoding glutamic acid to encoding valine <ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\"/>.\n\nThis change in the primary structure of the haemoglobin B subunit alters the functionality of the haemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual <ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2|doi-access=free }}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rearranged figures", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}

His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier.

During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=82}} On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier USS ''Midway''.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers.

During two combat tours, he shot down nine enemy aircraft to become a [[flying ace]].\n\nHe was an early member of the [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration squadron and flew the lead \"solo\" position. His work as a [[test pilot]] included aircraft, electronic systems, and operational tactics such as developing techniques for delivering nuclear weapons from small fighter aircraft. He commanded increasingly larger air units including [[VFA-11|VF-11]] and Carrier Air Group Ten as well as training organizations that helped the Navy transition from propeller to jet aircraft. He commanded two Navy ships, served as the head of Navy Fighter Design, and was a key contributor to fighter studies that resulted in the development of jet aircraft that {{as of|2015|lc=y}} are still in active service.\n\nFeightner was the only pilot to land the dash-1 variant of the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] aboard a carrier. He led VF-11 to become the first Atlantic fleet unit in which every pilot received the coveted \"E\" award in a single exercise. After retiring from the Navy, Feightner promoted aviation and shared his experiences with others.\n\n==Early life==\nFeightner was born on October 14, 1919 in [[Lima, Ohio]], a small town in the northwest part of the state, to Amos Evan and Mary Story (Roths) Feightner.{{sfnp|Wooldridge|1993|p=78}}<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=stpsnwT7jFoC&pg=PA510&dq=%22Amos+Evan+and+Mary+Story+(Roths)+Feightner%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiBv8Th7M7oAhULheAKHd7BA9sQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ]</ref> He attended [[Findlay College]] in Findlay, Ohio{{sfnp|Astor|2005|p=3}} and learned to fly in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP).

But he faced an eight-month delay before acceptance since the Army flight program could not cope with the large influx of people.

Feightner also tested the [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]], the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], and the [[Grumman F7F Tigercat]].<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p12>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |page=12}}</ref> When Colonel [[Charles Lindbergh]] came to evaluate the Tigercat, Feightner, as F7F project pilot, provided the pre-flight instruction.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_pp_14_15>{{cite book |last = Eanett |year=2005 |title=Interview Transcript |pages=14&ndash;15}}</ref>\n\n[[File:F7U-1 CVB-41 landing 1951.jpg|left|thumb|Feightner landing F7U-1, No. 415, on the USS Midway in 1951]]\nFeightner was assigned as the Navy's project pilot for the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]], a carrier-based jet [[fighter-bomber]] with [[swept wing]]s and an unusual [[Tailless aircraft|tailless]] design.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability tests of the Cutlass on board the {{USS|Midway|CV-41|6}}.{{sfnp|Gardner|2010|p=72}} Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=82}} On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier USS ''Midway''.{{sfnp|Powell|2008|p=37}} Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme nose-up attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the [[Landing Signal Officer]] (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly [[ramp strike|struck the ramp]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=83}} Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did not live up to its potential and remained in service less than four years.{{sfnp|Grossnick|1995|p=481}}\n\n===Blue Angels===\nIn January 1952, Feightner received orders to the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron&mdash;the Blue Angels. The squadron had been directed to add the Cutlass to their performance although neither Feightner nor Blue Angels commander [[Roy Marlin Voris|\"Butch\" Voris]] believed the aircraft was ready for formation flying.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}} The F7U was the Navy's first operational aircraft fitted with a hydraulic [[flight control system]] and reliability was still poor.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=46}} In the event of failure, the mechanical backup system required eleven seconds before control was restored.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=47}} The solution was to fly the F7Us separately from the rest of the team thereby creating the diamond and solo roles that remain to the present day. Feightner recruited former Blue Angel Lt. Harding C. \"Mac\" Macknight to fly the second Cutlass.{{sfnp|Wilcox|2006|p=239}}\n\n[[File:F7U-1 Blue Angels 1952.jpg|right|thumb|Blue Angels F7U-1 Cutlass in 1952]]\nAt the start of the 1952 show season, fuel control problems grounded the team's [[Grumman F9F Panther]]s leaving the Cutlasses to put on the primary demonstration between March and June.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=50}} During a show at [[Saufley Field]] in Florida, Feightner experienced a total loss of hydraulics on a full afterburner takeoff and steep climb. While trying to gain enough altitude for ejection he was able to stay with the aircraft until the back up control system engaged. He clipped trees on the end of the runway, causing the left engine to flame out. With hydraulic fluid streaming back in a bright flame, he made a hard turn and got the plane back on the runway, much to the excitement of the crowd.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=49}} Feightner and Macknight performed maneuvers that showed off the best attributes of the F7U. The two solos would approach each other from opposite ends of the runway and, after passing each other, would roll the aircraft, deploy [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and light [[afterburner]]s. In Feightner's opinion, \"There just is not an airplane like it anywhere.\"{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=51}}\n\nMaintenance issues and additional near-fatal accidents put an end to Blue Angel Cutlass performances.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=52}} While traveling to an airshow at [[Naval Air Station Glenview]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], both F7Us experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engines failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=53}} With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare Airport]] after Feightner's former VF-3 commander. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=86}} After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at [[Naval Air Station Memphis]], the F7Us were given to the station's training center.{{sfnp|Veronico|2005|p=56}}\n\n===Return to testing===\nIn September 1952, Feightner returned to flight test as the development officer for Air Development Squadron Three ([[VX-3 (Squadron)|VX-3]]).<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6/> VX-3 was located at [[Atlantic City Air National Guard Base|NAS Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]], and was responsible for testing fighter aircraft, systems, and munitions.{{sfnp|Lurie|2004|p=48}} In this new role, he tested aircraft systems (rather than the airplanes themselves) and determined what tactics would most effectively utilize those systems.<ref name=USN_Oral_History_Transcript_p6>{{cite book |last = Eanett |title=Interview Transcript |year=2005 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nOn December 3, 1953, Feightner participated in the first public demonstration of the [[Aircraft catapult#Steam catapult|steam catapult]] chosen  to launch heavy jet aircraft from the short decks of aircraft carriers. Flying a propeller-driven [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD Skyraider]] at the [[Naval Air Material Center]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Feightner described the steam-powered launch as \"much better for the pilot\" due to the relatively gentle start that eliminated the shock of other catapult techniques.<ref name=NAN_Feb_54>{{cite journal |last= |first=|date=February 1954 |title=From David to Brown |journal=Naval Aviation News |volume= |issue= |pages=1&ndash;2 |publisher=United States Navy |location=Washington, D.C. |doi= |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201231458/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1954/feb54.pdf |archivedate=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFeightner contributed to the development of weapon delivery tactics for the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]].{{sfnp|Mersky|2014|p=98}} The F2H-2B was modified for the attack role and had strengthened wings and pylons to accommodate a heavy weapon such as the  [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mark 7]] or [[Mark 8 nuclear bomb]].{{sfnp|Francillon|1990|p=81}} The F2H-2B testing on which Feightner worked included the longest non-stop, round trip flight from a carrier&mdash;more than 2,800 miles.

In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] and the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the first president to win a third term and then later a fourth term, giving rise to concerns about the potential issues involved with a president serving an unlimited number of terms. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 24, 1947, afhaljhfhnd submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratification]]. That process was completed on February 27, 1951, after the amendment had been ratified by the requisite 36 of the then-48 [[U.S. state|states]] (as neither [[Alaska]] nor [[Hawaii]] had been [[Admission to the Union|admitted as states]]), and its provisions [[Coming into force|came into force]] on that date.\n\nThe amendment prohibits any individual who has been elected president twice from being elected again. Under the amendment, an individual who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting greater than two years is also prohibited from winning election as president more than once. Scholars debate whether the amendment prohibits affected individuals from succeeding to the presidency under any circumstances or whether it only applies to presidential elections.\n\n==Text==\n<!-- Do not edit the words Article or President, they are capitalized as per the citation-->\n{{quote|'''Section 1.'''

Roosevelt]]'s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, the notion of presidential [[term limit]]s has long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president's role). Many\u2014including [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]]\u2014supported a lifetime appointment for presidents, while others favored fixed terms appointments. Virginia's [[George Mason]] denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to establishment of an [[elective monarchy]].<ref name=BuckleyMetzger>{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment| last1=Buckley| first1=F.

X, section 1.</ref>  Ultimately, the Framers approved four-year terms with no restriction on the amount of time a person could serve as president.\n\nThough dismissed by the Constitutional Convention, the concept of term limits for U.S. presidents took hold during the presidencies of [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. As his second term entered its final year in 1796, George Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by the unrelenting attacks from his political opponents, which had escalated after the signing of the [[Jay Treaty]], and believed that he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to stand for reelection to a third term, a decision he announced to the nation through a ''[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]]'' in September 1796.<ref>{{cite book| last=Ferling| first=John| authorlink=John E.

Following [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s reelection victory in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], there were serious discussions within Republican political circles about the possibility of his running again in 1876. Interest in a third term for Grant evaporated however, in the light of negative public opinion and opposition from members of Congress, and Grant left the presidency in 1877, after two terms. Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], but narrowly lost to [[James Garfield]], who would go on to win the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]].<ref name=PeabodyGant/>\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley's assassination]] ({{age in days|Mar 4 1901|Sep 14 1901}} days into his second term), and was subsequently elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. While he declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]], where he lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term. Many of Wilson's advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked that his name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Year of the Six Presidents |last=Pietrusza |first=David |publisher=Carroll and Graf |location=New York |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-78671-622-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 187\u2013200] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 }}</ref> Democratic Party leaders were unwilling to support Wilson, however, and the nomination eventually went to [[James M.

When the convention came, Roosevelt sent a message to the convention, saying he would run only if [[Draft (politics)|drafted]], saying delegates were free to vote for whomever they pleased.

Both these provisions were removed when the full Senate took up the bill, but a new provision was, however, added. Put forward by [[Robert A.

In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] and the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the first president to win a third term and then later a fourth term, giving rise to concerns about the potential issues involved with a president serving an unlimited number of terms. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 24, 1947, and submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratification]]. That process was completed on February 27, 1951, after the amendment had been ratified by the requisite 36 of the then-48 [[U.S. state|states]] (as neither [[Alaska]] nor [[Hawaii]] had been [[Admission to the Union|admitted as states]]), and its provisions [[Coming into force|came into force]] on that date.\n\nThe amendment prohibits any individual who has been elected president twice from being elected again. Under the amendment, an individual who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting greater than two years is also prohibited from winning election as president more than once.

Roosevelt]]'s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, the notion of presidential [[term limit]]s has long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president's role). Many\u2014including [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]]\u2014supported a lifetime appointment for presidents, while others favored fixed terms appointments. Virginia's [[George Mason]] denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to establishment of an [[elective monarchy]].<ref name=BuckleyMetzger>{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment| last1=Buckley| first1=F.

As his second term entered its final year in 1796, George Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by the unrelenting attacks from his political opponents, which had escalated after the signing of the [[Jay Treaty]], and believed that he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to stand for reelection to a third term, a decision he announced to the nation through a ''[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]]'' in September 1796.<ref>{{cite book| last=Ferling| first=John| authorlink=John E.

Following [[Ulysses S.

Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], but narrowly lost to [[James Garfield]], who would go on to win the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]].<ref name=PeabodyGant/>\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley's assassination]] ({{age in days|Mar 4 1901|Sep 14 1901}} days into his second term), and was subsequently elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. While he declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]], where he lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term.

Introduced by [[Earl C. Michener]], the measure passed 285\u2013121, with support from 47 Democrats, on February 6, 1947. Meanwhile, the Senate developed its own proposed amendment, which initially differed from the House proposal by requiring that the amendment be submitted to [[state ratifying conventions]] for ratification, rather than to the state legislatures, and by prohibiting any person who had served more than 365 days in each of two terms from further presidential service. Both these provisions were removed when the full Senate took up the bill, but a new provision was, however, added. Put forward by [[Robert A. Taft]], it clarified procedures governing the number of times a vice president who succeeded to the presidency might be elected to office.

Because of this apparent ambiguity, there may be a loophole in the 22nd Amendment whereby a two-term former president could be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency as a result of the incumbent's death, resignation, or removal from office (or even succeed to the presidency from some other stated office in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]).<ref name=PeabodyGant/><ref>{{cite web| url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/| title=The 22nd Amendment Doesn't Say What You Think It Says | publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm| location=Blandon, Pennsylvania| last=Ready| first=Joel A. |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that the 22nd Amendment and 12th Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the presidential line of succession.<ref>{{cite web| title=Constitutional Sleight of Hand| last=Franck| first=Matthew J.| date=July 31, 2007| accessdate=June 12, 2008| work=[[National Review]]|url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613214946/http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archivedate=June 13, 2008}}</ref> Others contend that the [[original intent]] of the 12th Amendment concerns qualification for ''service'' (age, residence, and citizenship), while the 22nd Amendment, concerns qualifications for ''election'', and thus ([[Strict constructionism|strictly applying the text]]) a former two-term president is still eligible to ''serve'' as vice president (neither amendment restricts the number of times an individual can be elected to the vice presidency), and then succeed to the presidency to serve out the balance of the term (though prohibited from running for election to an additional term).<ref>{{cite news |title=Why the Constitution permits a Gore-Clinton ticket |authorlink=Michael C.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur.

Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers. On the next day Hambirrao along with his senior generals Rupaji Bhosle and Anandrao Makaji met Sambhaji at Panhala. Sambhaji was delighted at the arrival of Hambirrao on his side<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Patil|first=Vishwas|title=Sambhaji|publisher=Mehta Publishing House|year=2016|isbn=9788177666519|location=Pune|pages=196-208}}</ref> . Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens. In order to accomplish the task, Kakar Khan destroyed more than 100 temples surrounding Burhanpur and conducting torture, plunder, killing, cutting of women's ears and men's eyes for the wealth.

Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur.

Sambhaji held a ceremony at Panhala to acknowledge Hambirrao's support. He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place of 16th January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions. Peshwa Moropant had died meanwhile, his position was given to his son Nilopant Pingale. [[Annaji Datto Sachiv|Anaji Datto]] was also pardoned but he was transferred to Mujumdar and his former post of Suranvis was given to [[Abaji Sondev]] <ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />. In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali. Senior ministers Anaji Datto, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Awji, Somaji Datto, Awji Balaji and others were arrested. Sambhaji had pardoned them before and they still conspired to poison him. Sambhaji gave the order to execute the traitors by trampling them under elephant.

Soyarabai was guilty for her actions and commited suicide by poisoning herself. Sambhaji was very sad at the demise of Soyarabai which is evident from the letter sent by him to Bakre Shastri of Kudal wherein he mentions that 'Soyarabai had a pure heart'.

Kakar was at the duty of collecting [[Jizya]] tax from the citizens.

They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the [[gunpowder magazine]] during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone [[causeway]] from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad.

[[Keshav Pandit]] was employed for Sambhaji's education. Keshav Pandit, alias Keshav Bhatta of Shringarpur, was an erudite scholar in the Nitishastra and Sanskrit language and literature. He seems to have deeper knowledge of the different forms of Sanskrit literature; Hindu jurisprudence and the Puranas. He also seems to have made Sambhaji familiar with the famous works of different sciences and music written by ancient scholars in the Sanskrit language.<ref name=\"Joshi1980\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ngBAAAAMAAJ&q=Keshav+Pandit+Sambhaji&dq=Keshav+Pandit+Sambhaji&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4nJWctqfaAhXMPo8KHa3gDC8Q6AEIJzAA|title=Chhatrapati Sambhaji, 1657\u20131689 A.D.|last=Joshi|first=Pandit Shankar|date=1980|publisher=S.
