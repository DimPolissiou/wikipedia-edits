Ribault was sent out by French [[Huguenots]] to find a suitable place for a settlement. Ribault named the rivers he saw the Seine and the Some, known today as the St. Marys and Satilla Rivers. Ribault described the area as, \"Fairest, fruitfulest and pleasantest of all the world.\"<ref name=\":2\">[http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/ogh/Camden_County,_Georgia \"]  [http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/ogh/Camden_County,_Georgia Camden County History\"] Our Georgia History</ref>\n\nIn 1565, [[Spain]] became alarmed by the French settlements and sent out a large force to take over and settle the area. During that time, the Spaniards attempted to convert the Native Americans to [[Catholicism]]. At least two missions operated on Cumberland Island, ministering to the [[Timucuan]] people, who had resided on the island for at least four thousand years.\n\nCompeting British and Spanish claims to the territory between their respective colonies of South Carolina and Florida was a source of international tension, and the colony of Georgia was founded in 1733 in part to protect the British interests. The Spanish theoretically lost their claim to the territory in 1742 after the [[Battle of Bloody Marsh]] (on [[St. Simons Island]]). However, settlement south of the [[Altamaha River]] (what is now Glynn and Camden Counties) was discouraged by both the British and Spanish governments. One group of settlers led by Edmund Gray sparked Spanish military action after settling on the [[Satilla River]] in the 1750s near present-day Burnt Fort, and were subsequently disbanded by the Royal Governor [[John Reynolds (Royal Navy officer)|John Reynolds]].<ref name=\":0\">Hamer, Marguerite Bartlett. \"Edmund Gray and His Settlement at New Hanover.\" The Georgia Historical Quarterly, ISSN 0016-8297, 03/1929, Volume 13, Issue 1, pp. 1 - 12</ref>\n\n[[James Oglethorpe|General Oglethorpe]] was at [[Cumberland Island]] when Tomochichi gave the barrier island its name. Later, he erected a hunting lodge on Cumberland named Dungeness, which was the predecessor of the famous Greene and Carnegie Dungeness Mansions. He also founded Fort St. Andrews on the north end of Cumberland Island as well as a strong battery, Fort Prince Williams, on the south end. Fort Prince Williams commanded the entrance to the St. Marys River, but had become a ruin by the Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1763, Spain, under a treaty of peace with [[Great Britain]], ceded [[Florida]] to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. After this, the boundaries of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were extended from the Altamaha (now the southern boundary of McIntosh County) to the St. Marys River (the current southern boundary of Camden). In 1765, four parishes were laid out between the Altamaha and St. Marys Rivers. These were St. Davids, St. Patricks, St. James, and the parishes of St. Marys and St. Thomas.\n\n===The early American era===\nLargely due to security issues arising from proximity to powerful Indian groups and British Florida, Georgia was the last colony to join in the [[American Revolutionary War|War for Independence]] in 1775. In the [[Constitution of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Constitution of 1777]] St. Thomas and St. Marys Parishes were formed into Camden County, named for [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Charles Pratt]], 1st [[Earl Camden]] in England, a supporter of American independence. Originally Camden County was larger and also included parts of present-day Ware, Brantley, and Charlton Counties, which were re-designated in the nineteenth century.\n\nAlso under the 1777 state constitution, Glynn County and Camden County had limited and restricted representation in the new patriotic Georgia government due to their extreme \"state of alarm\" throughout the war.<ref>Revolutionary Records of Georgia. Volume 1. page 285.</ref> Between 1776 and 1778 Camden County saw the construction of numerous forts, three failed American campaigns against the British at St. Augustine, and numerous depredations by raiders of various allegiance. One of the most notorious of these raiders was [[Daniel McGirt]]h.<ref>Martha Condray Searcy. ''The Georgia-Florida Contest in the American Revolution. ''University of Alabama Press, 1985. See also, Wilbur H. Siebert, \"Privateering in Florida Waters and Northwards in the American Revolution\". ''Florida Historical Quarterly XXII. 1943. 62-73. ''</ref> A significant loyalist faction existed in Camden County, headed by the brothers of [[James Wright (governor)|Royal Governor James Wright]], Charles and German Wright. They built a fort on the St. Marys River in 1775 to protect their lands and chattel during the war after repeated attacks by patriot banditti. Wright's Fort became a rendezvous for a group of loyalists called the \"Florida Rangers\". Two skirmishes were fought by Loyalist and Continental forces over Wright's Fort, and both times American troops failed to rout the Loyalists from the area. Finally, retreating British soldiers burned it down in 1778. The Americans rebuilt it when they invaded East Florida, and then burned it down to prevent it falling into enemy hands. The archaeological site was rediscovered in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/Lamar/images/PDFs/publication_62.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612161945/http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/Lamar/images/PDFs/publication_62.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary economic enterprise of the county was rice planting, particularly along the Satilla River. [[Sea Island Cotton|Sea Island cotton]] was grown on Cumberland Island, and short-staple cotton was grown on the mainland along with sugar cane. Various forest products including [[turpentine]] and timber were produced, mainly for consumption in the naval industry and the West Indies.<ref name=\":1\"/> Camden County also served as a hub of backcountry trade with American settlers and various Indian groups, and as a shipyard and shipping center centered around the town of St. Marys. The land in Camden County was owned by fewer than 300 people throughout the colonial and antebellum eras. Most of the white population worked in trades or as tenant farmers, while nearly all black residents were slaves. Until the 1840s (and increasingly strict black codes), Camden County had a small population of free black workers, mainly involved in day labor or maritime industry.\n\nCamden County was the site of many trading posts with the Native Americans, who by the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries consisted mainly of people of the [[Creek Nation]]. From America's earliest years and even after Indian Removal in the 1830s, the county was a site of significant conflict between settlers and Indians, leading to a small series of local Indian wars, and displacement of both Indian and local American refugees. An important step towards establishing boundaries in the Early Federal period came with the [[Treaty of Colerain]] which was signed on June 29, 1796 on the St. Marys between United States agents and the Creeks.\n\nOn January 15, 1815, British troops led by [[Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet|Sir George Cockburn]] landed on Cumberland Island. Their goal was to attack the fort at [[Battle of Point Peter|Point Peter]]. They quickly overwhelmed the small American forced and took Ft. Point Peter easily. After the skirmish, British soldiers occupied the county through February. They raided the town of St. Marys, as well as many plantations and smaller settlements. Although New Orleans was the last major battle of the war, the skirmish at Point Peter happened even later, almost a month after the [[Treaty of Ghent]] had been signed. The British occupation of Camden County led to the liberation of an estimated 1,485 slaves from Georgia and Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forgotteninvasion.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210030533/http://www.forgotteninvasion.com/index.html |archivedate=2012-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nCamden County was on an international border until the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819 between the United States and [[Spain]], making the Florida provinces American territory.\n\n===The Civil War and Reconstruction===\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, the population was 5,482 of which 1,721 were white.

Ribault was sent out by French [[Huguenots]] to find a suitable place for a settlement. Ribault named the rivers he saw the Seine and the Some, known today as the St. Marys and Satilla Rivers. Ribault described the area as, \"Fairest, fruitfulest and pleasantest of all the world.\"<ref name=\":2\">[http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/ogh/Camden_County,_Georgia \"]  [http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/ogh/Camden_County,_Georgia Camden County History\"] Our Georgia History</ref>\n\nIn 1565, [[Spain]] became alarmed by the French settlements and sent out a large force to take over and settle the area. During that time, the Spaniards attempted to convert the Native Americans to [[Catholicism]]. At least two missions operated on Cumberland Island, ministering to the [[Timucuan]] people, who had resided on the island for at least four thousand years.\n\nCompeting British and Spanish claims to the territory between their respective colonies of South Carolina and Florida was a source of international tension, and the colony of Georgia was founded in 1733 in part to protect the British interests. The Spanish theoretically lost their claim to the territory in 1742 after the [[Battle of Bloody Marsh]] (on [[St. Simons Island]]). However, settlement south of the [[Altamaha River]] (what is now Glynn and Camden Counties) was discouraged by both the British and Spanish governments. One group of settlers led by Edmund Gray sparked Spanish military action after settling on the [[Satilla River]] in the 1750s near present-day Burnt Fort, and were subsequently disbanded by the Royal Governor [[John Reynolds (Royal Navy officer)|John Reynolds]].<ref name=\":0\">Hamer, Marguerite Bartlett. \"Edmund Gray and His Settlement at New Hanover.\" The Georgia Historical Quarterly, ISSN 0016-8297, 03/1929, Volume 13, Issue 1, pp. 1 - 12</ref>\n\n[[James Oglethorpe|General Oglethorpe]] was at [[Cumberland Island]] when Tomochichi gave the barrier island its name. Later, he erected a hunting lodge on Cumberland named Dungeness, which was the predecessor of the famous Greene and Carnegie Dungeness Mansions. He also founded Fort St. Andrews on the north end of Cumberland Island as well as a strong battery, Fort Prince Williams, on the south end. Fort Prince Williams commanded the entrance to the St. Marys River, but had become a ruin by the Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1763, Spain, under a treaty of peace with [[Great Britain]], ceded [[Florida]] to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. After this, the boundaries of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] were extended from the Altamaha (now the southern boundary of McIntosh County) to the St. Marys River (the current southern boundary of Camden). In 1765, four parishes were laid out between the Altamaha and St. Marys Rivers. These were St. Davids, St. Patricks, St. James, and the parishes of St. Marys and St. Thomas.\n\n===The early American era===\nLargely due to security issues arising from proximity to powerful Indian groups and British Florida, Georgia was the last colony to join in the [[American Revolutionary War|War for Independence]] in 1775. In the [[Constitution of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Constitution of 1777]] St. Thomas and St. Marys Parishes were formed into Camden County, named for [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Charles Pratt]], 1st [[Earl Camden]] in England, a supporter of American independence. Originally Camden County was larger and also included parts of present-day Ware, Brantley, and Charlton Counties, which were re-designated in the nineteenth century.\n\nAlso under the 1777 state constitution, Glynn County and Camden County had limited and restricted representation in the new patriotic Georgia government due to their extreme \"state of alarm\" throughout the war.<ref>Revolutionary Records of Georgia. Volume 1. page 285.</ref> Between 1776 and 1778 Camden County saw the construction of numerous forts, three failed American campaigns against the British at St. Augustine, and numerous depredations by raiders of various allegiance. One of the most notorious of these raiders was [[Daniel McGirt]]h.<ref>Martha Condray Searcy. ''The Georgia-Florida Contest in the American Revolution. ''University of Alabama Press, 1985. See also, Wilbur H. Siebert, \"Privateering in Florida Waters and Northwards in the American Revolution\". ''Florida Historical Quarterly XXII. 1943. 62-73. ''</ref> A significant loyalist faction existed in Camden County, headed by the brothers of [[James Wright (governor)|Royal Governor James Wright]], Charles and German Wright. They built a fort on the St. Marys River in 1775 to protect their lands and chattel during the war after repeated attacks by patriot banditti. Wright's Fort became a rendezvous for a group of loyalists called the \"Florida Rangers\". Two skirmishes were fought by Loyalist and Continental forces over Wright's Fort, and both times American troops failed to rout the Loyalists from the area. Finally, retreating British soldiers burned it down in 1778. The Americans rebuilt it when they invaded East Florida, and then burned it down to prevent it falling into enemy hands. The archaeological site was rediscovered in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/Lamar/images/PDFs/publication_62.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612161945/http://shapiro.anthro.uga.edu/Lamar/images/PDFs/publication_62.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary economic enterprise of the county was rice planting, particularly along the Satilla River. [[Sea Island Cotton|Sea Island cotton]] was grown on Cumberland Island, and short-staple cotton was grown on the mainland along with sugar cane. Various forest products including [[turpentine]] and timber were produced, mainly for consumption in the naval industry and the West Indies.<ref name=\":1\"/> Camden County also served as a hub of backcountry trade with American settlers and various Indian groups, and as a shipyard and shipping center centered around the town of St. Marys. The land in Camden County was owned by fewer than 300 people throughout the colonial and antebellum eras. Most of the white population worked in trades or as tenant farmers, while nearly all black residents were slaves. Until the 1840s (and increasingly strict black codes), Camden County had a small population of free black workers, mainly involved in day labor or maritime industry.\n\nCamden County was the site of many trading posts with the Native Americans, who by the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries consisted mainly of people of the [[Creek Nation]]. From America's earliest years and even after Indian Removal in the 1830s, the county was a site of significant conflict between settlers and Indians, leading to a small series of local Indian wars, and displacement of both Indian and local American refugees. An important step towards establishing boundaries in the Early Federal period came with the [[Treaty of Colerain]] which was signed on June 29, 1796 on the St. Marys between United States agents and the Creeks.\n\nOn January 15, 1815, British troops led by [[Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet|Sir George Cockburn]] landed on Cumberland Island. Their goal was to attack the fort at [[Battle of Point Peter|Point Peter]]. They quickly overwhelmed the small American forced and took Ft. Point Peter easily. After the skirmish, British soldiers occupied the county through February. They raided the town of St. Marys, as well as many plantations and smaller settlements. Although New Orleans was the last major battle of the war, the skirmish at Point Peter happened even later, almost a month after the [[Treaty of Ghent]] had been signed. The British occupation of Camden County led to the liberation of an estimated 1,485 slaves from Georgia and Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forgotteninvasion.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210030533/http://www.forgotteninvasion.com/index.html |archivedate=2012-12-10 }}</ref>\n\nCamden County was on an international border until the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819 between the United States and [[Spain]], making the Florida provinces American territory.\n\n===The Civil War and Reconstruction===\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, the population was 5,482 of which 1,721 were white.

It includes the soundtrack to the 1967 [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|television film of the same name]]. The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the [[Parlophone]] label, while the [[Capitol Records]] LP release in the US occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year. It was not released as an eleven-track LP in the UK until 1976.\n\nIn their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967) and the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic sound]] they had pursued since ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966). The project was instigated by [[Paul McCartney]] in April 1967, but after the band recorded the song \"[[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|Magical Mystery Tour]]\", it lay dormant until the death of their manager [[Brian Epstein]] in late August. Recording then took place alongside filming and editing, and as the Beatles furthered their public association with [[Transcendental Meditation]] under teacher [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].\n\nThe sessions have been characterised by some biographers as aimless and unfocused, with the band members overly indulging in sound experimentation and exerting greater control over production. McCartney contributed three of the soundtrack songs, including the widely covered \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\", while [[John Lennon]] and [[George Harrison]] contributed \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" and \"[[Blue Jay Way]]\", respectively. The sessions also produced \"[[Hello, Goodbye]]\", issued as a single accompanying the soundtrack record, and items of [[incidental music]] for the film. Further to the Beatles' desire to experiment with record formats and packaging, the EP and LP included a 24-page booklet containing song lyrics, colour photos from film production, and colour story illustrations by cartoonist [[Bob Gibson (artist)|Bob Gibson]].\n\nDespite widespread media criticism of the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' film, the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In the UK, it topped the EPs chart compiled by ''[[Record Retailer]]'' and peaked at number 2 on the magazine's singles chart (later the [[UK Singles Chart]]) behind \"Hello, Goodbye\". The album topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1969. When [[EMI]] issued the Beatles' catalogue on compact disc in 1987, the track listing was standardised to the 1967 US LP.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nAfter the Beatles completed ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in April 1967, [[Paul McCartney]] wanted to create a film that captured a psychedelic theme similar to that represented by author and [[LSD]] proponent [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[Merry Pranksters]] on the [[US West Coast]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=254}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=439}} Titled ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', it would combine Kesey's idea of a psychedelic bus ride with McCartney's memories of Liverpudlians holidaying on [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] tours.{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=218}} The film was to be unscripted: various \"ordinary\" people were to travel on a coach and have unspecified \"magical\" adventures.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=90}} The Beatles began recording music for the soundtrack in late April, but the film idea then lay dormant. Instead, the band continued recording songs for the [[United Artists]] animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and, in the case of \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", for their appearance on the ''[[Our World (TV special)|Our World]]'' satellite broadcast on 25 June,{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=276\u201377}} before travelling over the summer months and focusing on launching their company [[Apple Corps|Apple]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=354}}\n\nIn late August, while the Beatles were attending a [[Transcendental Meditation]] seminar held by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] [[The Beatles in Bangor|in Wales]], their manager [[Brian Epstein]] died of a prescription drug overdose.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=276\u201377}} During a band meeting on 1 September, McCartney suggested they proceed with ''Magical Mystery Tour'',{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|pp=252\u201353}} which Epstein had given his approval to earlier in the year.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=263}} McCartney was keen to ensure the group had a point of focus after the loss of their manager.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=230}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=439\u201340}} His view was at odds with his bandmates' wishes, with [[George Harrison]] especially eager to pursue their introduction to meditation.{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=217}} According to publicist [[Tony Barrow]], McCartney envisaged ''Magical Mystery Tour'' as \"open[ing] doors for him\" personally and as a new career phase for the band in which he would be the \"executive producer\" of their films.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=38}}{{refn|group=nb|Barrow also said that McCartney was concerned that if the others travelled to India to study with the Maharishi, it would mean the end of the Beatles.{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=217}}}} [[John Lennon]] later complained that the project was typical of McCartney's \"tendency\" to want to work as soon as he had songs ready to record, yet he himself was unprepared and had to set about writing new material.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=263, 285}}\n\n==Recording and production==\n===Recording history===\nThe Beatles first recorded the film's [[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|title song]], with sessions taking place at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London between 25 April and 3 May. An instrumental jam was recorded on 9 May for possible inclusion in the film, although it was never completed.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=274}} According to Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]], the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' sessions \"began in earnest\" on 5 September; filming started on 11 September, and the two activities became increasingly \"intertwined\" during October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=122}} Most of the 16 September session was dedicated to taping a basic track for McCartney's \"[[Your Mother Should Know]]\", only for McCartney to then decide to return to the version he had previously discarded, from 22\u201323 August.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|pp=122, 126}} The latter sessions marked the Beatles' first in close to two months{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=117}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=179}} and took place at a facility new to the band \u2013 Chappell Recording Studios in central London \u2013 since they were unable to book EMI at short notice.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=122}}\n\nMany Beatles biographers characterise the group's post-''Sgt. Pepper'' recording sessions of 1967 as aimless and undisciplined.<ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\">{{cite magazine|last=Harris|first=John|title=The Day the World Turned Day-Glo!|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=March 2007|page=89}}</ref> The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD was at its height during that summer{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=129}} and, in author [[Ian MacDonald]]'s view, this resulted in a lack of judgment in their recordings as the band embraced randomness and sonic experimentation.<ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\" />{{refn|group=nb|According to MacDonald, the Beatles' \"native sharpness\" began to re-emerge in late August, after their two-month holiday, but \"never fully returned after ''Sgt. Pepper''\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=263\u201364}}}} [[George Martin]], the group's producer, chose to distance himself from their work at this time; he said that much of the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' recording was \"disorganised chaos\". [[Ken Scott]], who became their senior recording engineer during the sessions, recalled, \"the Beatles had taken over things so much that I was more their right-hand man than George Martin's\".{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=173}}{{refn|group=nb|Martin said the band's \"undisciplined, sometimes self-indulgent\" method of working during ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was preceded by the \"anarchy\" they had introduced to the recording of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' track \"[[Lovely Rita]]\". Then, an entire session was dedicated to overdubbing backing vocals, sundry noises and a paper-and-comb \"orchestra\".{{sfn|Heylin|2007|pp=153\u201354}}}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles magical mystery tour.jpg|thumb|The Beatles filming the sequence for \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" at [[RAF West Malling]]]]\nEarly, pre-overdub mixes of some of the film songs were prepared on 16 September,{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=126}} before the Beatles performed the music sequences during a six-day shoot at [[RAF West Malling]], a [[Royal Air Force]] base in Kent.{{sfn|Winn|2009|pp=79, 117}} The recording sessions continued alongside editing of the film footage, which took place in an editing suite in [[Soho]] and was mostly overseen by McCartney.{{sfn|Black|2002|pp=137\u201338}} The process led to a struggle between him and Lennon over the film's content.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=161}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison began working on the soundtrack to the psychedelic film ''[[Wonderwall (film)|Wonderwall]]'' in November 1967.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=283}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=151}} According to director [[Joe Massot]], Harrison accepted the commission because ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was \"Paul's project\" and he welcomed the opportunity to have a free hand in creating a film soundtrack.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=265}}}} The Beatles also recorded \"[[Hello, Goodbye]]\" for release as a single accompanying the soundtrack record.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=128}} That his film song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" was relegated to the B-side of the single, in favour of McCartney's pop-oriented \"Hello, Goodbye\", was another source of rancour for Lennon.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=232}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=138, 144, 340}} He later recalled, \"I began to submerge.\"{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Aankomst Maharish Makesh Yogi op Schiphol.

All four band members attended the 17 October memorial service for Epstein, held at the New London Synagogue on [[Abbey Road, London|Abbey Road]], close to EMI Studios, and the 18 October world premiere of ''[[How I Won the War]]'', a film in which Lennon had a starring role.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=280\u201382}} Recording for ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was completed on 7 November.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=130}} That day, the title song was given a new [[Barker (occupation)|barker]]-style introduction by McCartney (replacing Lennon's effort, which was nevertheless retained in the version used in the film){{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=176}} and an overdub of traffic sounds.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=130}}\n\nThree pieces of [[incidental music]] were recorded but omitted from the soundtrack record.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=142}} In the case of \"Shirley's Wild Accordion\", the scene was cut from the film.{{sfn|Carr|Tyler|1978|p=70}} Featuring an [[accordion]] score by arranger [[Mike Leander]], it was performed by Shirley Evans with percussion contributions from Starr and McCartney,{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=128}} and recorded at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in October.{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=189}} \"Jessie's Dream\" was taped privately by the Beatles and copyrighted to McCartney\u2013Starkey\u2013Harrison\u2013Lennon,{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=128}} while the third item was a brief [[Mellotron]] piece used to orchestrate the line \"The magic is beginning to work\" in the film.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=142}}{{refn|group=nb|The film also included  \"[[She Loves You]]\", played on a fairground organ; an orchestral version of \"[[All My Loving]]\"; and \"[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]\", performed by the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]].{{sfn|Womack|2014|pp=600\u201301}} In addition, the coda of \"Hello, Goodbye\" played over the end credits.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=129}}}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Production techniques and sounds===\n{{quote box|quote=They half knew what they wanted and half didn't know, not until they'd tried everything.

Pepper''{{sfn|Prendergast|2003|p=194}} and the psychedelic sound they had introduced in 1966 with ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.{{sfn|Reising|LeBlanc|2009|pp=98\u201399}}  Author [[Mark Hertsgaard]] highlights \"I Am the Walrus\" as the fulfilment of the band's \"guiding principle\" during the sessions \u2013\u00a0namely to experiment and be \"different\".{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=167}} To satisfy Lennon's request that his voice should sound like \"it came from the moon\", the engineers gave him a low-quality microphone to sing into and saturated the signal from the preamp microphone.{{sfn|Guesdon|Margotin|2013|p=430}} In addition to the song's string and horn arrangement, Martin wrote a score for the sixteen backing vocalists (the [[Mike Sammes Singers]]), in which their laughter, exaggerated vocalising and other noises evoked the LSD-inspired mood that Lennon sought for the piece.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|pp=166\u201367}} The orchestral arrangement and the vocal score were recorded on a separate four-track tape, which Martin and Scott then manually synchronised with the tape containing the band's performance.{{sfn|Guesdon|Margotin|2013|p=430}} The track was completed with Lennon overdubbing live radio signals found at random, finally settling on a [[BBC Third Programme]] broadcast of Shakespeare's ''[[The Tragedy of King Lear]]''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=128}}\n\nAccording to musicologist Thomas MacFarlane, ''Magical Mystery Tour'' shows the Beatles once more \"focusing on colour and texture as important compositional elements\" and exploring the \"aesthetic possibilities\" of studio technology.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=40}} \"[[Blue Jay Way]]\" features extensive use of three studio techniques employed by the Beatles over 1966\u201367:{{sfn|Guesdon|Margotin|2013|p=436}} [[flanging]], an audio delay effect;{{sfn|Womack|2014|pp=156\u201357}} sound-signal rotation via a [[Leslie speaker]];{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=122}} and (in the [[stereophonic|stereo]] mix only) reversed tapes.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=141}} In the case of the latter technique, a recording of the completed track was played backwards and faded in at key points during the performance,{{sfn|Guesdon|Margotin|2013|p=437}} creating an effect whereby the backing vocals appear to answer each line of Harrison's lead vocal in the verses.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=141}} Due to the limits of [[Multitrack recording|multitracking]], the process of feeding in reversed sounds was carried out live during the final mixing session.{{sfn|Guesdon|Margotin|2013|p=437}}{{refn|group=nb|Described by Lewisohn as \"quite problematical\",{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=130}} the process was not repeated for the [[monaural|mono]] mix of \"Blue Jay Way\".{{sfn|Guesdon|Margotin|2013|p=437}} Lewisohn adds that, like Lennon's \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"I Am the Walrus\", the song \"makes fascinating listening for anyone interested in what could be achieved in a 1967 recording studio\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=123}}}} A [[tape loop]] of decelerated guitar sounds was used on \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\"{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=132}} to create a swooshing bird-like effect towards the end of that song.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=138}} Lennon and Starr prepared seven minutes' worth of tape loops as a coda to \"[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]\", but this was discarded,{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=127}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=182}} leaving the track to end with a 30-second burst of Mellotron sounds.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=122}}\n\nAlthough he recognises ''Sgt. Pepper'' as the highpoint of the Beatles' application of sound \"colorisation\", musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] says that the band introduced some effective \"new touches\" during this period. He highlights the slow guitar [[tremolo]] on \"Flying\", the combination of female and male vocal chorus, cello [[Glissando|glissandi]] and found sounds on \"I Am the Walrus\", and the interplay between the lead vocal and [[viola]]s on \"Hello, Goodbye\".{{sfn|Everett|2006|p=88}} In MacFarlane's description, the songs reflect the Beatles' growing interest in stereo mixes, as \"remarkable sonic qualities\" are revealed in the placement of sounds across the stereo image, making for a more active listening experience.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n== Songs ==\n===Soundtrack===\n''Magical Mystery Tour'' included six tracks, a number that posed a challenge for the Beatles and their UK record company, [[EMI]], as there were too few for an [[LP record|LP album]] but too many for an [[Extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=131}} One idea considered was to issue an EP that played at 33'''\u2153''' [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], but this would have caused a loss of audio fidelity that was deemed unacceptable. The solution chosen was to issue the music in the innovative format of a double EP.{{sfn|Neaverson|1997|p=53}} It was the first example of a double EP in Britain.{{sfn|Neaverson|1997|p=53}}{{sfn|Larkin|2006|p=488}}\n\nAccording to music journalist [[Rob Chapman (journalist)|Rob Chapman]], each of the new tracks \"represents a distinct facet of the group's psychedelic vision\". He gives these as, in order of the EP's sequencing: celebration, nostalgia, absurdity, innocence, bliss and dislocation.{{sfn|Chapman|2015|p=}} Musicologist Russell Reising says that the songs variously further the Beatles' exploration of the thematic links between a psychedelic trip and travelling, and address the relationship between travel and time.{{sfn|Reising|LeBlanc|2009|pp=102\u201303, 105\u201306}} Ethnomusicologist David Reck comments that despite the Beatles' association with Eastern culture at the time, through their championing of the Maharishi, just two of the EP's songs directly reflect this interest.{{sfn|Reck|2008|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n====\"Magical Mystery Tour\"====\n{{listen\n|filename=Magical Mystery Tour (Beatles song - sample).ogg\n|title=\"Magical Mystery Tour\"\n|description=Excerpt from the [[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|opening title track]].\n}}\n\n\"[[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|Magical Mystery Tour]]\" was written as the main theme song shortly after McCartney conceived the idea for the film.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|pp=109\u201310}} In [[Hunter Davies]]' contemporary account of the 25 April session, McCartney arrived with the chord structure but only the opening refrain (\"Roll up / Roll up for the mystery tour\"), necessitating a brainstorming discussion the following day to complete the lyrics.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=103}} Like \"[[Sgt.

Pepper''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=121}} Its lyrical premise centres on the history of hit songs across generations.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=454}} He originally offered it for the ''Our World'' broadcast, but the Beatles favoured Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" for its social significance.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=224}} McCartney later said he wrote the song as a production number for ''Magical Mystery Tour'',{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=355}} where it provides the film's closing, [[Busby Berkeley]]\u2013style dance sequence.{{sfn|Greene|2016|pp=39\u201340}} In author Doyle Greene's view, the lyrics advocate generational understanding in the manner of \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\" but, unlike in the latter song, to the point of \"maternal authority and youth compliance\", and contrast sharply with the confrontational message of the EP's next track.{{sfn|Greene|2016|pp=40\u201341}}{{refn|group=nb|Greene adds that the sense of old-fashioned compliance in \"Your Mother Should Know\" is lessened in the film sequence for the song.

Bemused by this, Lennon set out to write a lyric that would confound analysis from scholars and music journalists.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=133}} In addition to drawing on Carroll's imagery and Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', he reworked a nursery rhyme from his school days,{{sfn|Courrier|2009|p=191}} and referenced [[Edgar Allan Poe]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=267}} and (in the vocalised \"googoogajoob\"s) [[James Joyce]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=138}} Author Jonathan Gould describes \"I Am the Walrus\" as \"the most overtly 'literary' song the Beatles would ever record\",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=444}} while MacDonald deems it \"[Lennon's] ultimate anti-institutional rant \u2013 a damn-you-England tirade that blasts education, art, culture, law, order, class, religion, and even sense itself\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=267}}\n\n====\"The Fool on the Hill\"====\nMcCartney wrote the melody for \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\" during the ''Sgt. Pepper'' sessions but the lyrics remained incomplete until September.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=121}} The song is about a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=455}} In Everett's interpretation, the fool's innocence leaves him adrift from and unwilling to engage with a judgmental society.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=138, 139\u201340}} McCartney said the idea was inspired by the Dutch design collective [[the Fool (design collective)|the Fool]], who derived their name from the [[The Fool (tarot)|tarot card of the same name]], and possibly by the Maharishi.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=343, 365\u201366}}{{refn|group=nb|In the recollection of [[Alistair Taylor]], a former assistant of Epstein, the song originated after he and McCartney were walking on [[Primrose Hill]] in north London and a man appeared before them but suddenly vanished.

For once, the U.S. release went better than the British original ... The result was simply the best set of Beatles tunes so far on a single disc.\"<ref name=\"DuNoyer/Blender\" /> [[AllMusic]] critic [[Richie Unterberger]] opined that the psychedelia was \"even spacier in parts\" than on ''Sgt. Pepper'', but \"there's no vague overall conceptual/thematic unity to the material, which has made ''Magical Mystery Tour'' suffer slightly in comparison. Still, the music is mostly great.\"<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\" /> Scott Plagenhoef of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' describes the EP-exclusive tracks as \"low key marvels\".<ref name=\"Plagenhoef/Pitchfork\" /> He says that while the album lacks a progressive quality from the band's previous work, it \"is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles' career\", and the mixed nature of the collection \"matters little when the music itself is so incredible\".{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=598}}\n\nWriting in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] said that the album was \"a lot goopier than ''Sgt. Pepper'', though lifted by the cheerful 'All You Need Is Love' and the ghostly 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' Her Majesty the Queen had the best comment: 'The Beatles are turning awfully funny, aren't they?'\"{{sfn|Brackett|Hoard|2004|p=53}} [[Neil McCormick]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the combination of soundtrack and singles meant the album lacked cohesion, but he still found it an \"intriguing psychedelic companion piece\" to ''Sgt. Pepper'' and highlighted \"I Am the Walrus\" as a \"mad, surrealist epic ... in which Lennon takes the concept of lyrical and musical nonsense and just explodes it all over the speakers\".<ref name=\"McCormick/DT\" /> Reviewing for ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' in 2002, [[Charles Shaar Murray]] said ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was the Beatles album he turned to most often following Harrison's death the previous year and that it evokes an era \"when society still seemed to be opening up rather than closing down\".{{sfn|Shaar Murray|2002|pp=128, 130}} Given its experimental qualities, he deemed it \"the other half of the double-album that ''Sgt. Pepper'' should have been\".{{sfn|Shaar Murray|2002|p=128}} Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', [[Mark Kemp]] views ''Magical Mystery Tour'' as a work of \"symphonic sprawl\" that marks the culmination of a five-year period in which the Beatles led pop music's expansion into [[world music]], psychedelia, [[avant-pop]] and [[electronica]], while bringing the genre a bohemian audience for the first time. He says that while the album resembles a ''Sgt. Pepper'' \"Part 2\", it \"breathes easier and includes stronger songs\" and benefits from the lack of a \"forced concept\".<ref name=\"Kemp/Paste\" />\n\nAmong Beatles biographers, Jonathan Gould says the album's resequencing of the EP songs heightens the project's \"''Pepper'' redux\" quality, with its opening title track recalling \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"I Am the Walrus\" providing the \"weighty end\" in the manner of \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". He similarly views \"The Fool on the Hill\" as the \"[[Fixing a Hole]]\"\u2013style \"cool, contemplative ballad\", just as Harrison provides \"another droning epic\" and McCartney offers \"another archaic number\" in \"Your Mother Should Know\", which he finds a \"halfhearted attempt at satiric nostalgia\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=453, 454}} Chris Ingham, writing in ''The Rough Guide to the Beatles'', says that the soundtrack's reputation suffers from its association with the film's failure, yet while three of the tracks are rightly overlooked, \"The Fool on the Hill\", \"Blue Jay Way\" and \"I Am the Walrus\" remain \"essential Beatlemusic\".{{sfn|Ingham|2006|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n''Magical Mystery Tour'' was ranked at number 138 in [[Paul Gambaccini]]'s 1978 book ''[[Critic's Choice: Top 200 Albums]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/album/A119.htm|title=The Beatles ''Magical Mystery Tour''|publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]|accessdate=7 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017204738/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/album/A119.htm|archive-date=17 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> based on submissions from a panel of 47 critics and broadcasters.{{sfn|Heylin|2007|p=265}}<ref>Leopold, Todd (7 March 2007).

It includes the soundtrack to the 1967 [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|television film of the same name]]. The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the [[Parlophone]] label, while the [[Capitol Records]] LP release in the US occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year. It was not released as an eleven-track LP in the UK until 1976.\n\nIn their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967) and the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic sound]] they had pursued since ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966). The project was instigated by [[Paul McCartney]] in April 1967, but after the band recorded the song \"[[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|Magical Mystery Tour]]\", it lay dormant until the death of their manager [[Brian Epstein]] in late August. Recording then took place alongside filming and editing, and as the Beatles furthered their public association with [[Transcendental Meditation]] under teacher [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].\n\nThe sessions have been characterised by some biographers as aimless and unfocused, with the band members overly indulging in sound experimentation and exerting greater control over production. McCartney contributed three of the soundtrack songs, including the widely covered \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\", while [[John Lennon]] and [[George Harrison]] contributed \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" and \"[[Blue Jay Way]]\", respectively. The sessions also produced \"[[Hello, Goodbye]]\", issued as a single accompanying the soundtrack record, and items of [[incidental music]] for the film. Further to the Beatles' desire to experiment with record formats and packaging, the EP and LP included a 24-page booklet containing song lyrics, colour photos from film production, and colour story illustrations by cartoonist [[Bob Gibson (artist)|Bob Gibson]].\n\nDespite widespread media criticism of the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' film, the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In the UK, it topped the EPs chart compiled by ''[[Record Retailer]]'' and peaked at number 2 on the magazine's singles chart (later the [[UK Singles Chart]]) behind \"Hello, Goodbye\". The album topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1969. When [[EMI]] issued the Beatles' catalogue on compact disc in 1987, the track listing was standardised to the 1967 US LP.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\nAfter the Beatles completed ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in April 1967, [[Paul McCartney]] wanted to create a film that captured a psychedelic theme similar to that represented by author and [[LSD]] proponent [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[Merry Pranksters]] on the [[US West Coast]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=254}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=439}} Titled ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', it would combine Kesey's idea of a psychedelic bus ride with McCartney's memories of Liverpudlians holidaying on [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] tours.{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=218}} The film was to be unscripted: various \"ordinary\" people were to travel on a coach and have unspecified \"magical\" adventures.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=90}} The Beatles began recording music for the soundtrack in late April, but the film idea then lay dormant. Instead, the band continued recording songs for the [[United Artists]] animated film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and, in the case of \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", for their appearance on the ''[[Our World (TV special)|Our World]]'' satellite broadcast on 25 June,{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=276\u201377}} before travelling over the summer months and focusing on launching their company [[Apple Corps|Apple]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=354}}\n\nIn late August, while the Beatles were attending a [[Transcendental Meditation]] seminar held by [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] [[The Beatles in Bangor|in Wales]], their manager [[Brian Epstein]] died of a prescription drug overdose.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=276\u201377}} During a band meeting on 1 September, McCartney suggested they proceed with ''Magical Mystery Tour'',{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|pp=252\u201353}} which Epstein had given his approval to earlier in the year.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=263}} McCartney was keen to ensure the group had a point of focus after the loss of their manager.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=230}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=439\u201340}} His view was at odds with his bandmates' wishes, with [[George Harrison]] especially eager to pursue their introduction to meditation.{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=217}} According to publicist [[Tony Barrow]], McCartney envisaged ''Magical Mystery Tour'' as \"open[ing] doors for him\" personally and as a new career phase for the band in which he would be the \"executive producer\" of their films.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=38}}{{refn|group=nb|Barrow also said that McCartney was concerned that if the others travelled to India to study with the Maharishi, it would mean the end of the Beatles.{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=217}}}} [[John Lennon]] later complained that the project was typical of McCartney's \"tendency\" to want to work as soon as he had songs ready to record, yet he himself was unprepared and had to set about writing new material.{{sfn|Miles|2001|pp=263, 285}}\n\n==Recording and production==\n===Recording history===\nThe Beatles first recorded the film's [[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|title song]], with sessions taking place at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London between 25 April and 3 May. An instrumental jam was recorded on 9 May for possible inclusion in the film, although it was never completed.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=274}} According to Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]], the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' sessions \"began in earnest\" on 5 September; filming started on 11 September, and the two activities became increasingly \"intertwined\" during October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=122}} Most of the 16 September session was dedicated to taping a basic track for McCartney's \"[[Your Mother Should Know]]\", only for McCartney to then decide to return to the version he had previously discarded, from 22\u201323 August.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|pp=122, 126}} The latter sessions marked the Beatles' first in close to two months{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=117}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=179}} and took place at a facility new to the band \u2013 Chappell Recording Studios in central London \u2013 since they were unable to book EMI at short notice.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=122}}\n\nMany Beatles biographers characterise the group's post-''Sgt. Pepper'' recording sessions of 1967 as aimless and undisciplined.<ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\">{{cite magazine|last=Harris|first=John|title=The Day the World Turned Day-Glo!|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=March 2007|page=89}}</ref> The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD was at its height during that summer{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=129}} and, in author [[Ian MacDonald]]'s view, this resulted in a lack of judgment in their recordings as the band embraced randomness and sonic experimentation.<ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\" />{{refn|group=nb|According to MacDonald, the Beatles' \"native sharpness\" began to re-emerge in late August, after their two-month holiday, but \"never fully returned after ''Sgt. Pepper''\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=263\u201364}}}} [[George Martin]], the group's producer, chose to distance himself from their work at this time; he said that much of the ''Magical Mystery Tour'' recording was \"disorganised chaos\". [[Ken Scott]], who became their senior recording engineer during the sessions, recalled, \"the Beatles had taken over things so much that I was more their right-hand man than George Martin's\".{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=173}}{{refn|group=nb|Martin said the band's \"undisciplined, sometimes self-indulgent\" method of working during ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was preceded by the \"anarchy\" they had introduced to the recording of the ''Sgt.

Then, an entire session was dedicated to overdubbing backing vocals, sundry noises and a paper-and-comb \"orchestra\".{{sfn|Heylin|2007|pp=153\u201354}}}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles magical mystery tour.jpg|thumb|The Beatles filming the sequence for \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" at [[RAF West Malling]]]]\nEarly, pre-overdub mixes of some of the film songs were prepared on 16 September,{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=126}} before the Beatles performed the music sequences during a six-day shoot at [[RAF West Malling]], a [[Royal Air Force]] base in Kent.{{sfn|Winn|2009|pp=79, 117}} The recording sessions continued alongside editing of the film footage, which took place in an editing suite in [[Soho]] and was mostly overseen by McCartney.{{sfn|Black|2002|pp=137\u201338}} The process led to a struggle between him and Lennon over the film's content.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=161}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison began working on the soundtrack to the psychedelic film ''[[Wonderwall (film)|Wonderwall]]'' in November 1967.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=283}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=151}} According to director [[Joe Massot]], Harrison accepted the commission because ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was \"Paul's project\" and he welcomed the opportunity to have a free hand in creating a film soundtrack.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=265}}}} The Beatles also recorded \"[[Hello, Goodbye]]\" for release as a single accompanying the soundtrack record.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=128}} That his film song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" was relegated to the B-side of the single, in favour of McCartney's pop-oriented \"Hello, Goodbye\", was another source of rancour for Lennon.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1996|p=232}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=138, 144, 340}} He later recalled, \"I began to submerge.\"{{sfn|Stark|2005|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Aankomst Maharish Makesh Yogi op Schiphol.

Pepper'' as the highpoint of the Beatles' application of sound \"colorisation\", musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] says that the band introduced some effective \"new touches\" during this period. He highlights the slow guitar [[tremolo]] on \"Flying\", the combination of female and male vocal chorus, cello [[Glissando|glissandi]] and found sounds on \"I Am the Walrus\", and the interplay between the lead vocal and [[viola]]s on \"Hello, Goodbye\".{{sfn|Everett|2006|p=88}} In MacFarlane's description, the songs reflect the Beatles' growing interest in stereo mixes, as \"remarkable sonic qualities\" are revealed in the placement of sounds across the stereo image, making for a more active listening experience.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n== Songs ==\n===Soundtrack===\n''Magical Mystery Tour'' included six tracks, a number that posed a challenge for the Beatles and their UK record company, [[EMI]], as there were too few for an [[LP record|LP album]] but too many for an [[Extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=131}} One idea considered was to issue an EP that played at 33'''\u2153''' [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], but this would have caused a loss of audio fidelity that was deemed unacceptable. The solution chosen was to issue the music in the innovative format of a double EP.{{sfn|Neaverson|1997|p=53}} It was the first example of a double EP in Britain.{{sfn|Neaverson|1997|p=53}}{{sfn|Larkin|2006|p=488}}\n\nAccording to music journalist [[Rob Chapman (journalist)|Rob Chapman]], each of the new tracks \"represents a distinct facet of the group's psychedelic vision\". He gives these as, in order of the EP's sequencing: celebration, nostalgia, absurdity, innocence, bliss and dislocation.{{sfn|Chapman|2015|p=}} Musicologist Russell Reising says that the songs variously further the Beatles' exploration of the thematic links between a psychedelic trip and travelling, and address the relationship between travel and time.{{sfn|Reising|LeBlanc|2009|pp=102\u201303, 105\u201306}} Ethnomusicologist David Reck comments that despite the Beatles' association with Eastern culture at the time, through their championing of the Maharishi, just two of the EP's songs directly reflect this interest.{{sfn|Reck|2008|pp=70\u201371}}\n\n====\"Magical Mystery Tour\"====\n{{listen\n|filename=Magical Mystery Tour (Beatles song - sample).ogg\n|title=\"Magical Mystery Tour\"\n|description=Excerpt from the [[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|opening title track]].\n}}\n\n\"[[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|Magical Mystery Tour]]\" was written as the main theme song shortly after McCartney conceived the idea for the film.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|pp=109\u201310}} In [[Hunter Davies]]' contemporary account of the 25 April session, McCartney arrived with the chord structure but only the opening refrain (\"Roll up / Roll up for the mystery tour\"), necessitating a brainstorming discussion the following day to complete the lyrics.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=103}} Like \"[[Sgt.

Bemused by this, Lennon set out to write a lyric that would confound analysis from scholars and music journalists.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=133}} In addition to drawing on Carroll's imagery and Shakespeare's ''King Lear'', he reworked a nursery rhyme from his school days,{{sfn|Courrier|2009|p=191}} and referenced [[Edgar Allan Poe]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=267}} and (in the vocalised \"googoogajoob\"s) [[James Joyce]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=138}} Author Jonathan Gould describes \"I Am the Walrus\" as \"the most overtly 'literary' song the Beatles would ever record\",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=444}} while MacDonald deems it \"[Lennon's] ultimate anti-institutional rant \u2013 a damn-you-England tirade that blasts education, art, culture, law, order, class, religion, and even sense itself\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=267}}\n\n====\"The Fool on the Hill\"====\nMcCartney wrote the melody for \"[[The Fool on the Hill]]\" during the ''Sgt.

For once, the U.S. release went better than the British original ... The result was simply the best set of Beatles tunes so far on a single disc.\"<ref name=\"DuNoyer/Blender\" /> [[AllMusic]] critic [[Richie Unterberger]] opined that the psychedelia was \"even spacier in parts\" than on ''Sgt. Pepper'', but \"there's no vague overall conceptual/thematic unity to the material, which has made ''Magical Mystery Tour'' suffer slightly in comparison. Still, the music is mostly great.\"<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\" /> Scott Plagenhoef of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' describes the EP-exclusive tracks as \"low key marvels\".<ref name=\"Plagenhoef/Pitchfork\" /> He says that while the album lacks a progressive quality from the band's previous work, it \"is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles' career\", and the mixed nature of the collection \"matters little when the music itself is so incredible\".{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=598}}\n\nWriting in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'', [[Rob Sheffield]] said that the album was \"a lot goopier than ''Sgt. Pepper'', though lifted by the cheerful 'All You Need Is Love' and the ghostly 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' Her Majesty the Queen had the best comment: 'The Beatles are turning awfully funny, aren't they?'\"{{sfn|Brackett|Hoard|2004|p=53}} [[Neil McCormick]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the combination of soundtrack and singles meant the album lacked cohesion, but he still found it an \"intriguing psychedelic companion piece\" to ''Sgt. Pepper'' and highlighted \"I Am the Walrus\" as a \"mad, surrealist epic ... in which Lennon takes the concept of lyrical and musical nonsense and just explodes it all over the speakers\".<ref name=\"McCormick/DT\" /> Reviewing for ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' in 2002, [[Charles Shaar Murray]] said ''Magical Mystery Tour'' was the Beatles album he turned to most often following Harrison's death the previous year and that it evokes an era \"when society still seemed to be opening up rather than closing down\".{{sfn|Shaar Murray|2002|pp=128, 130}} Given its experimental qualities, he deemed it \"the other half of the double-album that ''Sgt. Pepper'' should have been\".{{sfn|Shaar Murray|2002|p=128}} Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', [[Mark Kemp]] views ''Magical Mystery Tour'' as a work of \"symphonic sprawl\" that marks the culmination of a five-year period in which the Beatles led pop music's expansion into [[world music]], psychedelia, [[avant-pop]] and [[electronica]], while bringing the genre a bohemian audience for the first time. He says that while the album resembles a ''Sgt. Pepper'' \"Part 2\", it \"breathes easier and includes stronger songs\" and benefits from the lack of a \"forced concept\".<ref name=\"Kemp/Paste\" />\n\nAmong Beatles biographers, Jonathan Gould says the album's resequencing of the EP songs heightens the project's \"''Pepper'' redux\" quality, with its opening title track recalling \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"I Am the Walrus\" providing the \"weighty end\" in the manner of \"[[A Day in the Life]]\". He similarly views \"The Fool on the Hill\" as the \"[[Fixing a Hole]]\"\u2013style \"cool, contemplative ballad\", just as Harrison provides \"another droning epic\" and McCartney offers \"another archaic number\" in \"Your Mother Should Know\", which he finds a \"halfhearted attempt at satiric nostalgia\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=453, 454}} Chris Ingham, writing in ''The Rough Guide to the Beatles'', says that the soundtrack's reputation suffers from its association with the film's failure, yet while three of the tracks are rightly overlooked, \"The Fool on the Hill\", \"Blue Jay Way\" and \"I Am the Walrus\" remain \"essential Beatlemusic\".{{sfn|Ingham|2006|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n''Magical Mystery Tour'' was ranked at number 138 in [[Paul Gambaccini]]'s 1978 book ''[[Critic's Choice: Top 200 Albums]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/album/A119.htm|title=The Beatles ''Magical Mystery Tour''|publisher=[[Acclaimed Music]]|accessdate=7 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017204738/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/album/A119.htm|archive-date=17 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> based on submissions from a panel of 47 critics and broadcasters.{{sfn|Heylin|2007|p=265}}<ref>Leopold, Todd (7 March 2007).

It is found primarily in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]] basins, and formerly in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Going on maximum size, it is the second most massive living species of bony fish behind the [[ocean sunfish]]<ref name=\"Huso huso\">[http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/speciesSummary.php?ID=2067&genusname=Huso&speciesname=huso Huso huso.] Fishbase.com. Accessed on 11 January 2008</ref>. Heavily fished for the female's valuable [[roe]], known as [[beluga caviar]], wild populations have been greatly reduced by [[overfishing]] and [[poaching]].\n\n==Etimology==\nThe common name for the sturgeon, as for the unrelated [[beluga whale]], is derived from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439 (''beliy''), meaning \"white\", probably referring to the extensive pale colour on the flancs and belly in beluga compared to other sturgeons. </br>\nOther common names are morun ([[Romania|Ro]]), moruna ([[Bulgaria|Bu]]), viza ([[Hungary|Hu]]), vyza velka ([[Czech Republic|Cz]]), vyza ([[Slovakia|Slov]]), storione ladano or storione attilo ([[Italy|It]]), grand esturgeon ([[France|F]]), Hausen ([[Germany|G]])<ref name=\":0\">Vecsei, P., Sucui, R., & Peterson, D.

The series of longitudinal scutes are five: dorsal (1 series, 9-17 scutes), lateral (2 series, one per side, 28-60 scutes each) and ventral series (2 series, one per side, 7-14 scutes each).

It became widely known in the United States after comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] parodied it in his 1940 film ''[[The Great Dictator]]''. Comedy group [[The Three Stooges]] also made fun of it in two of their [[short subject]] comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamian, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly after the war and sold 60 years later at an auction in [[San Francisco]] for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced [[Ethiopia]] with [[Italian East Africa]] and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.\n\n==Origin==\nTwo limited editions of the globe were made in Berlin in the mid 1930s, one for the [[Nazi Party]] and another for German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] himself.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} The one made for Hitler was nearly the size of a [[Volkswagen]] car and manufactured at a great expense. It changed Abyssinia (today's [[Ethiopia]]) to [[Italian East Africa]]. The other was made of standard wood with no special features.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} The actual number of globes produced cannot be verified as the factory that produced the globe, along with its archives, was destroyed in air raids in 1943.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}}\n\nWolfram Pobanz, [[Poles|Polish]] historian and globe enthusiast, believes that even though it was located in his office, Hitler was probably not particularly fond of the globe, declaring:\n\n{{cquote|Hitler probably didn't think anything about the globe. There's no picture of Hitler beside the globe. He controlled all photographs of himself. If the globe had actually meant anything special to Hitler, there would surely be a photograph.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} }}\n\nIn 1938, Hitler decided that the [[Reich Chancellery#Old Reich Chancellery|old Reich Chancellery]] was not big enough to house the ministries of [[Nazi Germany]].

It became widely known in the United States after comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] parodied it in his 1940 film ''[[The Great Dictator]]''. Comedy group [[The Three Stooges]] also made fun of it in two of their [[short subject]] comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamian, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly after the war and sold 60 years later at an auction in [[San Francisco]] for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced [[Ethiopia]] with [[Italian East Africa]] and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.\n\n==Origin==\nTwo limited editions of the globe were made in Berlin in the mid 1930s, one for the [[Nazi Party]] and another for German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] himself.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} The one made for Hitler was nearly the size of a [[Volkswagen]] car and manufactured at a great expense. It changed Abyssinia (today's [[Ethiopia]]) to [[Italian East Africa]]. The other was made of standard wood with no special features.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} The actual number of globes produced cannot be verified as the factory that produced the globe, along with its archives, was destroyed in air raids in 1943.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}}\n\nWolfram Pobanz, [[Poles|Polish]] historian and globe enthusiast, believes that even though it was located in his office, Hitler was probably not particularly fond of the globe, declaring:\n\n{{cquote|Hitler probably didn't think anything about the globe. There's no picture of Hitler beside the globe. He controlled all photographs of himself. If the globe had actually meant anything special to Hitler, there would surely be a photograph.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} }}\n\nIn 1938, Hitler decided that the [[Reich Chancellery#Old Reich Chancellery|old Reich Chancellery]] was not big enough to house the ministries of [[Nazi Germany]]. He assigned his favorite architect [[Albert Speer]] to build the new Chancellery.{{sfn|BBC 2015}} After the massive renovations were completed in early 1939 per Hitler's insistence, the globe was moved to the F\u00fchrer's new office located at the heart of the new Chancellery, where it remained until the Soviets occupied the building in April 1945.{{sfn|BBC 2015}}\n\n==Whereabouts==\nNumerous globes purported to have been owned by Hitler exist throughout the world, although the authenticity of many of them is doubtful.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} There are a total of three in Berlin: one at a geographical institute, another at the [[M\u00e4rkisches Museum|Marcher Museum]], and the third at the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum|German Historical Museum]].{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} Another two reside in public collections in [[Munich]].{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}} Many of the globes show Germany with a bullet hole or simply wiped out, an act committed out of contempt by either Soviet or American soldiers.{{sfn|de Quetteville|2007}}\n[[File:Dictator charlie5.jpg|thumb|left|The Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders being parodied in ''The Great Dictator'']]\n\nBased on photographic evidence, none of these globes are the iconic one from Hitler's office in the Chancellery.{{sfn|Kimmelman|2007}}\n\nIn May 1945, one globe allegedly owned by Hitler was found by American soldier John Barsamian among the ruins of the ''[[Kehlsteinhaus]]'' (\"Eagle's Nest\"), a personal retreat near the [[Bavarian Alps]] used by Hitler on several occasions before the war.
