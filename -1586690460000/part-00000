Various governmental sponsors have recently exercised their right to prevent employees from leaving the country, effectively holding them against their will for no good reason. Some individuals after resigning have not been issued with their exit permits, denying them their basic right to leave the country. Many sponsors do not allow the transfer of one employee to another sponsor. This does not apply to special sponsorship of a Qatar Financial Center-sponsored worker, where it is encouraged and regulated that sponsorship should be uninhibited and assistance should be given to allow for such transfers of sponsorship. \nIn May 2014, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, Chairman of Qatar's National Human Rights Committee (NHRC), said that Doha had officially announced the end of the current sponsorship system, and had passed a new law replacing it with a new one in which contracts are signed between the workers and their employers.

Under the provisions of Qatar's sponsorship law, sponsors have the unilateral power to cancel workers' residency permits, deny workers' ability to change employers, report a worker as \"absconded\" to police authorities, and deny permission to leave the country. As a result, sponsors may restrict workers' movements and workers may be afraid to report abuses or claim their rights.<ref>[[Qatar|Qatar on Wikipedia.org]] 23 December 2012 {{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\nQatar's government is keen to protect the status quo and does not want to compromise its cultural values or standard of living by allowing foreigners to become a permanent part of society. The only route to becoming a naturalized citizen is by marriage to a national; even this, however, does not guarantee citizenship, particularly for non-Muslims.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances only, Qatar's ruler might grant citizenship to a foreigner who has provided outstanding service to the state over a number of years. A generous employer might reward a loyal worker who has made a major contribution to the company over many years by providing him with a work and residence permit, renewable each year until the employee reaches the age of 60. After one's retirement, however, the employer would have to be a figure of considerable influence to maintain this gift and satisfy the labor authorities. In this case, one would not be a citizen, but merely be allowed to remain in the country indefinitely based on yearly renewable permits. In most cases, the retired person who reaches 60 years old has to leave the country and end his contract, but he can return upon granting of a special visa.\n\nQatari authorities require employers not to issue a contract for more than 20 consecutive years; there is no chance for workers and employees to get a visa renewed if the contract has passed 20 years with the same employer. This is because the Qatari government does not want to commit itself to paying pensions or retirement end of service for people who lived for 20 years, and at the same time avoids the possibility that the person may ask for nationality or citizenship.\n\nChildren of foreigners born in Qatar do not have rights of local citizenship and automatically assume the nationality of the parents. On the other hand, if the father is a national of Qatar, the child will usually be granted local nationality and may later become a national of Qatar and obtain a local passport. If the father is a foreigner and the mother is a Qatari citizen the child is not granted any citizenship rights.\n\nIn many cases, the child is not affected, but any children that he has might not enjoy the same rights of nationality, citizenship, abode, etc. as his parents and grandparents.<ref>[http://www.justlanded.com/english/Qatar/Qatar-Guide/Visas-Permits/Citizenship Qatar: Is it possible to become a national of Qatar? ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102064818/http://www.justlanded.com/english/Qatar/Qatar-Guide/Visas-Permits/Citizenship |date=2 January 2013 }} 23 December 2012</ref>\n\n=== LGBT rights in Qatar ===\n{{Main|LGBT rights in Qatar}}\n[[Sodomy]] between consenting male adults in Qatar is illegal, and subject to a sentence of up to five years in prison.<ref>Ready, Freda.

Various governmental sponsors have recently exercised their right to prevent employees from leaving the country, effectively holding them against their will for no good reason. Some individuals after resigning have not been issued with their exit permits, denying them their basic right to leave the country. Many sponsors do not allow the transfer of one employee to another sponsor. This does not apply to special sponsorship of a Qatar Financial Center-sponsored worker, where it is encouraged and regulated that sponsorship should be uninhibited and assistance should be given to allow for such transfers of sponsorship. \nIn May 2014, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, Chairman of Qatar's National Human Rights Committee (NHRC), said that Doha had officially announced the end of the current sponsorship system, and had passed a new law replacing it with a new one in which contracts are signed between the workers and their employers.

As a result, sponsors may restrict workers' movements and workers may be afraid to report abuses or claim their rights.<ref>[[Qatar|Qatar on Wikipedia.org]] 23 December 2012 {{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\nQatar's government is keen to protect the status quo and does not want to compromise its cultural values or standard of living by allowing foreigners to become a permanent part of society. The only route to becoming a naturalized citizen is by marriage to a national; even this, however, does not guarantee citizenship, particularly for non-Muslims.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances only, Qatar's ruler might grant citizenship to a foreigner who has provided outstanding service to the state over a number of years. A generous employer might reward a loyal worker who has made a major contribution to the company over many years by providing him with a work and residence permit, renewable each year until the employee reaches the age of 60. After one's retirement, however, the employer would have to be a figure of considerable influence to maintain this gift and satisfy the labor authorities. In this case, one would not be a citizen, but merely be allowed to remain in the country indefinitely based on yearly renewable permits. In most cases, the retired person who reaches 60 years old has to leave the country and end his contract, but he can return upon granting of a special visa.\n\nQatari authorities require employers not to issue a contract for more than 20 consecutive years; there is no chance for workers and employees to get a visa renewed if the contract has passed 20 years with the same employer. This is because the Qatari government does not want to commit itself to paying pensions or retirement end of service for people who lived for 20 years, and at the same time avoids the possibility that the person may ask for nationality or citizenship.\n\nChildren of foreigners born in Qatar do not have rights of local citizenship and automatically assume the nationality of the parents. On the other hand, if the father is a national of Qatar, the child will usually be granted local nationality and may later become a national of Qatar and obtain a local passport. If the father is a foreigner and the mother is a Qatari citizen the child is not granted any citizenship rights.\n\nIn many cases, the child is not affected, but any children that he has might not enjoy the same rights of nationality, citizenship, abode, etc. as his parents and grandparents.<ref>[http://www.justlanded.com/english/Qatar/Qatar-Guide/Visas-Permits/Citizenship Qatar: Is it possible to become a national of Qatar? ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102064818/http://www.justlanded.com/english/Qatar/Qatar-Guide/Visas-Permits/Citizenship |date=2 January 2013 }} 23 December 2012</ref>\n\n=== LGBT rights in Qatar ===\n{{Main|LGBT rights in Qatar}}\n[[Sodomy]] between consenting male adults in Qatar is illegal, and subject to a sentence of up to five years in prison.<ref>Ready, Freda.

In 1917 a [[train ferry]] was introduced on the lake operating from Kalemie, but is long gone.\n* '''Katanga line:''' Kabalo (Lualaba River port and junction with Great Lakes line) \u2013 Kamungu - Katumba \u2013 ''[[Kabongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Kabongo]]'' (or a town 8&nbsp;km south-east) \u2013 [[Kamina]] (junction with Kasia line) - Bukama (Lualaba River port) \u2013 Tenke (junction with [[Benguela Railway]]) - [[Likasi]] \u2013 [[Lubumbashi]] - [[Sakania]] - [[Zambia]], {{RailGauge|1067mm}}. There are a number of short branch lines in the mining areas between Tenke and Kolwezi. The section from near Kabongo to Kamina was described by UNJLC in 2006 as 'very degraded'.

This connects the Katanga line to the river port at Ilebo from where boats can reach Kinshasa. Freight is transferred to river barges, but in 2006 UNJLC reports the river service operates sporadically. On 1 August 2007 a passenger train ran out of control on the line 170&nbsp;km north-west of Kananga and 7 coaches overturned, killing about 100 people.\n* '''Katanga-Benguela line:''' A branch of the Katanga Railway was built from Tenke junction just north-west of Likasi via [[Kolwezi]] to [[Dilolo]] at the [[Angola]]n border to connect with the [[Benguela Railway]] {{RailGauge|1067mm}} from [[Luau, Moxico|Luau]] to the Atlantic port of [[Lobito]]. This allowed through passenger trains to run between Lubumbashi and Lobito, and freight trains to carry copper from the Zambian and Katangan [[Copperbelt]]s to a seaport for the export of [[copper]]. It was this purpose which provided the investment for the [[Benguela Railway]]. It did not operate through [[Angola]] from the 1970s, due to the civil war there. The line between Kolwezi and Dilolo was described by UNJLC in 2006 as 'very degraded'.

{"title_page": "2000 AD crossovers", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''2000 AD'' crossovers}}\n'''''2000 AD'' crossovers''' are [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] stories appearing in British comic ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'', its sister title the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', and other related output, such as novels, [[radio drama|audio plays]], films and [[role-playing game]]s.\n\nNot all of the stories told in ''2000 AD'' and its related publications exist in the same [[shared universe]], unlike in some other comics, for example, the [[DC Universe|DC]] and [[Marvel Universe|Marvel]] Universes. Indeed the majority of stories which have appeared in ''2000 AD'' since [[1977 in comics|1977]] have never been connected with each other. However, the series which are so connected are generally the most significant ones in the comic in terms of the number of issues they have appeared in, their popularity with readers, and their significance in the history of the comic.\n[[Image:2000AD logo.png|right|framed|''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' logo.]]\n\n==Stories set in a shared universe==\nThose ''2000 AD'' stories which occupy a shared universe and have crossed over with each other include:\n\n*''[[ABC Warriors]]''\n*''[[Durham Red]]''\n*''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]''\n*''[[Harlem Heroes]]''\n*''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]''\n*''[[Judge Dredd]]''\n*''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]''\n*''[[Robo Hunter]]''\n*''[[Ro-Busters]]''\n*''[[Rogue Trooper]]''\n*''Mercy Heights''\n*''[[Strontium Dog]]''\n*''[[Young Middenface]]''\n\n==Connections between stories==\nSeries can be linked to each other in either of two ways: '''[[Fictional crossover|crossovers]]''' and '''spin-offs'''. There are also combinations of both.\n\n===Crossovers===\nFirstly, series which were completely independent of each other when they were created \u2013 often by different writers, and sometimes even in different comics \u2013 were later linked to each other. This could be done either by a crossover story in which two or more characters from the respective series meet each other, or by a caption or piece of dialogue explicitly referring to events which occurred or characters who appeared in an earlier story in another series. Two examples of the former kind are the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories \"Top Dog\" and [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|\"Judgement Day\"]], which both featured Johnny Alpha from the series ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' in a major role. Alpha lived over half a century in Dredd's future, and the crossover was accomplished by having Alpha time-travel back to Dredd's era. An example of the second kind is the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]],\" which featured a dinosaur called [[Satanus (comics)|Satanus]] who was described as the clone of the offspring of the female dinosaur which had appeared in most episodes of the earlier series ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]].'' ''Flesh'' was a previously unconnected series about humans time travelling back to the Cretaceous era to harvest dinosaurs for their meat.\n\nSometimes the link between two series can be of paramount importance to the story (such as Alpha's appearance in ''Judge Dredd''); in other stories the reference can be a passing homage to an earlier tale with no effect whatsoever on the plot of the story in which it occurs (such as the reference to Satanus' ancestry in \"The Cursed Earth\"). In either case, once a connection between two series was established, it was often repeated. For example, \"Top Dog\" was followed up by \"Judgement Day,\" and the reference to ''Flesh'' in ''Judge Dredd'' was reciprocated by the cameo appearance of a [[Judge (2000 AD)|Mega-City judge]] in ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]] Book V,'' which was itself a crossover with ''Flesh'' because it featured Satanus in a major role.\n\nThis latter example illustrates how series were not just linked to each other in pairs, but in multitudes. [[Pat Mills]], the first editor of ''2000 AD'' and creator of many enduring series, was responsible for many such connections. He deliberately connected his own series ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' to ''Flesh'', and then linked ''Nemesis'' to both. (All three series were created by him, but they had originally had nothing to do with each other.) For example, ''ABC Warriors'' made a passing reference to a dinosaur being the son of Satanus. Satanus himself subsequently played an important part in ''[[Nemesis the Warlock#Book V|Nemesis Book V]]'', by which time the entire cast of ''ABC Warriors'' had themselves moved to the ''Nemesis'' strip. This therefore established that ''Judge Dredd, Flesh, Nemesis,'' and ''ABC Warriors'' all existed in the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]: a list which would be added to many more times.\n\n===Spin-offs===\nSecondly, a new series can be created as a deliberate offshoot from a parent series. This can also occur in two ways. One method was to take a [[sidekick|supporting character]] from an existing series and start a new series with that character in the lead (sometimes with the lead character from the original series appearing in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]). Two examples are [[Judge Anderson]], first introduced in ''Judge Dredd'', being given her own series, ''Anderson: Psi Division,'' five years later; and [[Durham Red]] getting her own series after her debut in ''Strontium Dog''. Since ''Judge Dredd'' and ''Strontium Dog'' occupy the same universe, it follows that Anderson and Red do too (although they have never both appeared in the same story).\n\nAnother method was to create a brand new character for a new series, but to state from the outset that the story took place in an existing environment from an established strip. Most of the series in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' were created in this way. In ''2000 AD'' ''[[The 86ers]]'' was a series  set in the world of ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' which did not feature the established cast of its parent strip.\n\n=== Early issues ===\n\nIn the earliest issues and annuals, connections and crossovers would link up many of the earliest strips. The most prominent examples are ''Harlem Heroes'' ending and then the lead character's son turning up as a cadet judge in the next issue; ''The Cursed Earth'' linking Dredd's future to ''Flesh'' with Satanus, the cloned son of tyrannosaur One-Eye; and ''ABC Warriors'' starting as a prequel to ''Ro-Busters'', a sequel to ''Invasion!'', and then introducing a sequel to ''Flesh'' and ''The Cursed Earth'' with Satanus's son. Minor links included Ro-Jaws watching the Harlem Heroes and a comrade of Hammerstein referring to the under-construction Mega-City One in ''Ro-Busters'' flashbacks; a Mega-City Time Tour feature in an annual, where ''Flesh'' corporation Trans-Time offered holidays to both 2103 Mega-City One and 1999 Volgan-occupied England.<ref>Reprinted in ''Judge Dredd: The Restricted Files'' vol. 4</ref>\n\n===''Rogue Trooper''===\nThe series ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' was  both a crossover and a spin-off from itself. The original series ran in ''2000 AD'' from issues 228 to 635, when it ended. A completely [[Friday (2000 AD)|new series]] of ''Rogue Trooper'' then began in issue 650, by a different writer. This was not intended to be a sequel to the old version, but was a brand new, modernised reinterpretation of the character, with significant differences from the old version. It was not supposed to be set in the same universe or continuity, but was a total replacement (or \"[[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\") of both. However, years later and in the hands of a new writer, a story was written which established that the new and old Rogue Troopers were two different people inhabiting the same universe, and a convoluted continuity was contrived to explain their co-existence. In an unusually complicated crossover, the two Rogue Troopers actually met each other. This state of affairs did not continue for long, however, and the old version was killed off. Ironically, the new version declined in popularity and the strip was discontinued, only to be replaced with the original version, in stories set before the original's death.\n\nThere have been a number of less complicated ''Rogue Trooper'' spinoffs largely following the adventures of the other [[G.I. (comics)|G.I.s]], like [[Venus Bluegenes]], [[The 86ers|Rafaelle Blue]] and [[Tor Cyan]]. The new version of Rogue met Judge Dredd in a special story which took up the whole of issue 900 (the first time this had ever happened in what is usually an anthology comic containing five stories per issue).\n\n===''Laissez-faire'' approach===\nWhile ''2000 AD'' writers and editors have generally ensured that events occurring in spin-offs and their parent series are usually mutually consistent with each other, so that events in one such strip do not contradict events in another, much less care \u2013 if any \u2013 is taken to ensure a uniform continuity between crossover series. Therefore, while events which occur in the ''Anderson, Psi Division'' spin-off may have repercussions in ''Judge Dredd'' and ''vice versa'', the continuity of ''Strontium Dog'' might be ignored.\n\nThis can even occur within the crossover story itself: in \"Judgement Day\" Johnny Alpha travelled back in time from 2178 to 2114 to arrest a time-travelling criminal so he would not wipe out Earth (and thus, the future). The death of three billion people and destruction of five whole mega-cities then seemed to have no impact on Alpha's era. It was never explained in the story how an event as significant as a world war did not appear to be remembered by history in Alpha's era. On top of that, the future history of ''Strontium Dog'' bears little resemblance to ''Dredd'', with no mega-cities and mutants as an underclass in 'norm' cities in 2150. (''The Americans'' in Judge Dredd Megazine no. 283 implied that ''Strontium Dog's'' nuclear war ''will'' occur in 2150, but this was a [[MacGuffin]] to drive the story forward.)\n\nIn these cases, the crossover is not a serious attempt at world-building and continuity, simply a means of having two popular characters meet. Writer [[John Wagner]] has even stated that he does not view ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Dredd'' as being in the same continuity.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Wagner/22334044612?ref=mf Wagner's Facebook page], statement in reply to a November 6, 2009 comment</ref>\n\nWriters have also changed their minds over time. In the 2000s ''ABC Warriors'' stories, there is no attempt at fitting the Volgan War into Dredd's timeline or ''Harlem Heroes'' (but he does refer to ''Nemesis The Warlock'' in ''Dredd: Blood of Satanus II'', in order to declare ''Satanus Unchained'' out of canon). Other writers have also made no mention of this, and generally do not link up non-Dredd strips. It is also a habit of writers who created a strip to ignore the work of others if they feel like it. The John Wagner story ''Origins'' refers to Pat Mills' ''Dredd'' stories but makes no attempt to acknowledge ''Invasion!'', ''ABC Warriors'', and ''Ro-Busters'' (or ''Harlem Heroes''); ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'' acknowledges and retcons his death under Alan Grant, but deliberately erases ''Strontium Dogs'' (with a narrator calling Peter Hogan's strips the work of \"notorious fantasist Ho Gan\"). In the sequel series ''Savage'', Mills acknowledges the original ''Invasion!'' (to the extent that there's a King Charles III in the 2000s, just as prog 1 said) but ignores the prequel strip ''Disaster 1990!''. And while ''Harlem Heroes'' was linked to ''Dredd'', the sequel strip ''Inferno'' was left separate until Al Ewing's ''Dredd Year One: Wear Iron'' novella.\n\n==Crossovers==\nAs most of the ''2000 AD'' crossovers occur on the same timeline, not in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], the majority of crossovers take place thanks to the widespread, but temperamental, [[time travel]] technology that was invented at the beginning of the 22nd century.\n\n===Stories by Pat Mills===\n[[Pat Mills]] was responsible for the majority of the crossovers.\n\n*''Judge Dredd'': \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\" introduced the dinosaur [[Satanus (comics)|Satanus]] and linked ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' to ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]''.<ref>Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books), p. 103</ref>\n*''[[ABC Warriors]]'': \"Golgotha\", in the first series, featured the son of Satanus and linked ''ABC Warriors'' to ''Flesh''.\n*''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]'': \"[[Nemesis the Warlock#Book Four|Book IV:]] The Gothic Empire\" introduced both the ABC Warriors and the [[Ro-Jaws]] character from ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' to Nemesis. \"[[Nemesis the Warlock#Book Five|Book V:]] The Vengeance of Thoth\" featured the return of Satanus in a major role, and a cameo by a judge of Mega-City One, linking ''Nemesis'' to ''Flesh'' and ''Judge Dredd''. In a later ''Dredd'' strip by Mills, Dredd referred to Satanus' return to the [[Cretaceous]] in ''Nemesis'' (how he knew about it was not explained).\n*[[Hammerstein (comics)#Hammerstein in Judge Dredd|''Judge Dredd'': \"Hammerstein\"]] featured ABC Warrior [[Hammerstein (comics)|Hammerstein]] in the Cursed Earth outside Mega-City One, following the [[Atomic Wars]] started by President [[President Robert L. Booth|Booth]] in 2070. This linked ''ABC Warriors'' to ''Judge Dredd'', in addition to the existing Satanus connection. (This link was retconned away in other strips.)\n*The [[Volgans]] appear as the enemies of Bill Savage in ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', and also in early episodes of ''ABC Warriors'' as the enemies of the character [[Hammerstein (robot)#Character history|Hammerstein]] and the creators of the ABC warrior Blackblood. Flashback stories have shown more of the Volgan War, and Volgan robot Volkhan was introduced as a 'present' day villain in ''The Volgan War Book One''.\n*''[[Bill Savage|Savage]]'' ''Books 5, 6 ''and'' 7'' included characters and backstory from ''[[Ro-Busters]]''.\n*Another ''ABC Warriors'' story in 2012, \"Return to Earth,\" established further links between ''Savage'' and ''Ro-Busters''.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1800-1812</ref>\n\n===Stories by Ian Edginton===\nWriter [[Ian Edginton]] has begun linking his pseudo-historical strips together, both covertly and overtly. Images of both Jack Dancer from ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and [[Hastur]] from ''[[Leviathan (comic)|Leviathan]]'' later appeared in ''[[Stickleback (comics)|Stickleback]]''; the pub \"The Jolly Cripple\", a haunt of the ''Red Seas'' pirates, reappears as the haunt of the character Detective Valentine and contains a portrait of the original proprietress from ''Red Seas'';<ref>[http://disraeli-demon.blogspot.com/2007/01/references-in-stickleback-parts-1-2.html D'Blog of 'Israeli: References In Stickleback Parts 1 & 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ''Leviathan'' villain William Ashbless briefly appears in ''Stickleback'' as a member of the sinister City Fathers group.<ref>[http://disraeli-demon.blogspot.com/2007/02/stickleback-part-8-references.html D'Blog of 'Israeli: Stickleback Part 8 References<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the second ''Stickleback'', the eponymous lead visits the London-based Brotherhood of the Book from ''The Red Seas'', in the process meeting (and revealing history with) ''Seas'' villain Orlando Doyle. There is also an appearance by Herbert Sewell, an unfortunate and long-suffering scientist/time traveller in Edginton's ''Judge Dredd'' stories, being dragged into [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]; and an ogre of the same species seen in Edginton's ''American Gothic'' Wild West strip is seen at the villain's Wild West show. ''The Red Seas'' would later reveal that ''Stickleback's'' Orlando was from an alternate universe, and that the Brotherhood of the Book exists in multiple universes.\n\n''Ampney Crucis Investigates'' made the connections stronger: characters referred to the Leviathan ship and the myth of the Hollow Earth from ''The Red Seas''; the otherworldly monsters were given a similar background as in ''Stickleback''; and a shadowy antagonist was shown to have a staff with a bust of Hastur's head. Stickleback's son appears in the fourth ''Ampney Crucis'' story as an adult, London's crime lord in an alternate dimension where the [[First World War]] never happened; in the same world, an underground society of cyborg fanatics called \"Babbagists\" has sprung up around the works of Countess Bernoulli, a ''Stickleback'' villain.\n\n===Stories by John Smith===\nThe writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] often places a number of his characters in the same stories, which has become known among fans as [[Smithiverse|The Smithiverse]]. These have never been explicitly linked to the other ''2000 AD'' stories, but stand together as an independent universe of their own. However, one particular species of alien of Smith's creation has appeared in both the Smithiverse (in ''[[Firekind]]'' and ''[[Tyranny Rex]]'') and in a ''Judge Dredd'' universe story (''Pussyfoot 5'', a spin-off from ''Devlin Waugh'').\n\nSmithiverse stories include ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', ''[[Tyranny Rex]]'' and ''[[Firekind]]''.\n\n===Stories by other writers===\n\n====Judge Dredd stories====\n\nA number of characters have appeared in Judge Dredd stories (or vice versa).\n\n=====Ant Wars=====\nDredd spinoff ''Zancudo!'' by [[Simon Spurrier]] revealed itself to be a sequel to ''Ant Wars'', a 1970s strip about giant ants rampaging through South America, in the cliffhanger ending to Part 2. The giant ants were revealed to be living in the jungles near [[Ciudad Barranquilla]], and were at war with the giant mosquitos that formed the strip's villains.\n\n=====Harlem Heroes=====\nThe first [[Judge Giant]] was the son of Giant of the [[Harlem Heroes]], and his father was shown upon Giant's graduation from the Academy of Law.<ref>\"The Academy of Law\" (by [[John Wagner]])</ref> Later on, Judge Giant Jr (the first Judge Giant's son) would meet his aged grandfather a few days before he died.<ref>Judge Dredd Megazine #216</ref>\n\n=====Rogue Trooper=====\n[[Southers|Souther]] troops flee Nu-Earth back through time to Mega-City One in 2116.

Due to the distortion of reality, characters from dozens of 2000 AD strips made cameo appearances, either in the background or as parts of the plot (Dredd is attacked by the vampires from ''Fiends of the Eastern Front'' and then has to avoid Old One-Eye from ''Flesh'').\n\n=====Judge Dredd: \"The Cold Deck\" and \"Trifecta\"=====\n''The Cold Deck'' was a story written by [[Al Ewing]] which ran in ''2000 AD'' at the same time as two other series set in Dredd's world, ''[[Jack Point|The Simping Detective]]'' and ''[[Low Life (comics)|Low Life]]''. These stories initially appeared to have no other connection with each other, but after each of them had been running independently for a couple of issues their plotlines unexpectedly intertwined with each other, and it became apparent that Ewing had collaborated with the writers of the other two series, [[Simon Spurrier]] and [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]], to create a single large crossover story. The three series merged into a single story for their concluding part, called ''[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|Trifecta]]'', which took up every page of ''2000 AD'' #1812.\n\n====Rogue Trooper and Mercy Heights====\n*''Rogue Trooper'': \"Blue on Blue\" and sequels joined together the original and new versions of the character in the same continuity (see above).\n*''Mercy Heights'' was initially a new series with no connection to ''Rogue Trooper.'' When the series ended [[Tor Cyan]], a character from the series, began his own [[eponym]]ous series, in which it was eventually revealed that he was a [[G.I. (comics)|genetic infantryman]] like Rogue Trooper.\n\n==Spin-offs==\nThis list does not include direct sequels, such as ''Inferno'' and ''Savage''.\n\n===Judge Dredd spin-offs===\n{{Main|Judge Dredd Megazine}}\nJudge Dredd spin-offs include:\n*''[[Judge Anderson|Anderson: Psi Division]]''\n*''[[Armitage (comics)|Armitage]]''\n*''[[Banzai Battalion]]''\n*''[[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]]''\n*''[[Cursed Earth Koburn]]''\n*''[[The Dead Man]]''\n*''Devlin Waugh''\n**''[[Pussyfoot 5]]''\n*''[[Judge Janus|Janus: Psi Division]]''\n*''[[Judge Death]]''\n*''[[Judge Hershey]]''\n*''[[Juliet November]]''\n*''[[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]]''\n*''[[Judge Grice#Purgatory|Purgatory]]''\n*''[[Red Razors]]''\n*''[[Inspector Shimura|Shimura]]''\n*''[[Jack Point (the Simping Detective)|The Simping Detective]]''\n*''[[Tales from the Black Museum]]''\n*''Walter the Wobot''\n\n===Rogue Trooper spin-offs===\nThe original ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' led to:\n*The new version, [[Friday (2000 AD)|\"Friday\"]]\n*[[Venus Bluegenes]]\n*[[The 86ers]]\n*[[Rogue Trooper#Jaegir|Jaegir]]\n*Hunted\n\n''See also'' [[Tor Cyan]]\n\n===Other spin-offs===\n*''[[ABC Warriors]]'' was a spin-off from ''[[Ro-Busters]]''\n*''[[Deadlock (2000 AD)|Deadlock]]'' was a spin-off from ''[[ABC Warriors]]''\n*''[[Durham Red]]'', ''[[Young Middenface]]'', ''Tales From the Doghouse'' and ''Strontium Dogs'' were spin-offs from ''[[Strontium Dog]]''\n*''[[Tor Cyan]]'' was a spin-off from ''Mercy Heights''\n\n==Parallel universes==\nAs well as the tying together of a lot of the stories in ''2000 AD'', other [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] are known to co-exist alongside the main one, and some of them have intruded into it. Most famously in ''Judge Dredd'', this has happened with [[Judge Death]] and the [[Dark Judges]], coming from a reality where life is a crime. The aforementioned \"Helter Skelter\" had a wide range of deceased villains coming from alternate dimensions where they had won, and \"Rehab\" (progs 1644-8) featured an incursion from a utopian Earth where the Judges are pacifists focused on rehabilitation.\n\nSince 2003, ''Sinister Dexter'' has been running a storyline where criminals from a parallel Earth, led by \"Holy\" Moses Tanenbaum (dead in the main universe), have been trying to take over the city of Downlode in the main universe. When the other Earth was shown, it was revealed a major reason for the move was that China (\"the ChiComs\") were winning a war against Russia and rapidly advancing towards Downlode. The final part saw Sinister and Dexter chasing a target through other ''2000 AD'' strips, which turned out to be other realities.\n\n==Intercompany crossovers==\n[[Image:Lobo JudgeDredd panel.JPG|200px|thumb|Judge Dredd meets [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. Art by [[Val Semeiks]].]]\nThere have been numerous [[intercompany crossover]]s between ''2000 AD'' stories and with stories published by other companies ([[DC Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]]). Given his high-profile these often mix other characters with [[Judge Dredd]]. These include:\n\n===Aliens===\n{{Main|Judge Dredd vs. Aliens}}\n\n[[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Mr Bones|Mr Bones]] eventually manages to launch his revenge on Mega-City One, unleashing the [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorph]] (called the [[Incubus (demon)|Incubus]] here) into the Grand Hall of Justice itself.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd vs. Aliens]]: Incubus'' (written by [[John Wagner]] and [[Andy Diggle]], with art by [[Henry Flint]], in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' #1332\u20131335, [[2003 in comics|2003]], [[Trade paperback (comics)|tpb]], 104 pages, [[Rebellion Developments]], 2003, {{ISBN|1-904265-10-3}}, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], [[2004 in comics|2004]], {{ISBN|1-56971-983-7}})<br />[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=ALIENS Aliens crossover publication details]</ref> The story has been mentioned a few times, though the xenomorph's exact origin was kept quiet.\n\n===Batman===\n{{Main|Judgement on Gotham}}\n\nThere have been four crossovers with [[Batman]]: a team-up with Dredd to defeat the combined might of [[Judge Death]], Mean Machine, and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]], with the two heroes clashing; Dredd going to [[Gotham City]] to save Batman from the Ventriloquist; both heroes being part of a faked deathmatch run by the Riddler; and [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] and the Dark Judges teaming up, with the Joker becoming a fifth Dark Judge.<ref>''[[Judgement on Gotham]]'' (written by [[John Wagner]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], with art by [[Simon Bisley]], [[graphic novel]], [[1991 in comics|1991]]) and three sequels <br />[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=Specials&choice=BATMAN Batman crossover publication details]</ref>\n\nThe Batman crossovers have had significant impact on Dredd's world. A vision of the fourth crossover, ''Die Laughing'', causing Cassandra Anderson to return to being a Judge, as the crossover was written before she had quit and had been delayed. Judge Death was finally captured due to the events of ''Judgement on Gotham''. ''Die Laughing'' had the Dark Judges encased in plasteen crystals, which is how they would always be shown in later stories and the ''[[Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs.

Indeed the majority of stories which have appeared in ''2000 AD'' since [[1977 in comics|1977]] have never been connected with each other. However, the series which are so connected are generally the most significant ones in the comic in terms of the number of issues they have appeared in, their popularity with readers, and their significance in the history of the comic.\n[[Image:2000AD logo.png|right|framed|''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' logo.]]\n\n==Stories set in a shared universe==\nThose ''2000 AD'' stories which occupy a shared universe and have crossed over with each other include:\n\n*''[[ABC Warriors]]''\n*''[[Durham Red]]''\n*''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]''\n*''[[Harlem Heroes]]''\n*''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]''\n*''[[Judge Dredd]]''\n*''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]''\n*''[[Robo Hunter]]''\n*''[[Ro-Busters]]''\n*''[[Rogue Trooper]]''\n*''Mercy Heights''\n*''[[Strontium Dog]]''\n*''[[Young Middenface]]''\n\n==Connections between stories==\nSeries can be linked to each other in either of two ways: '''[[Fictional crossover|crossovers]]''' and '''spin-offs'''. There are also combinations of both.\n\n===Crossovers===\nFirstly, series which were completely independent of each other when they were created \u2013 often by different writers, and sometimes even in different comics \u2013 were later linked to each other. This could be done either by a crossover story in which two or more characters from the respective series meet each other, or by a caption or piece of dialogue explicitly referring to events which occurred or characters who appeared in an earlier story in another series. Two examples of the former kind are the ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories \"Top Dog\" and [[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|\"Judgement Day\"]], which both featured Johnny Alpha from the series ''[[Strontium Dog]]'' in a major role. Alpha lived over half a century in Dredd's future, and the crossover was accomplished by having Alpha time-travel back to Dredd's era. An example of the second kind is the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]],\" which featured a dinosaur called [[Satanus (comics)|Satanus]] who was described as the clone of the offspring of the female dinosaur which had appeared in most episodes of the earlier series ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]].'' ''Flesh'' was a previously unconnected series about humans time travelling back to the Cretaceous era to harvest dinosaurs for their meat.\n\nSometimes the link between two series can be of paramount importance to the story (such as Alpha's appearance in ''Judge Dredd''); in other stories the reference can be a passing homage to an earlier tale with no effect whatsoever on the plot of the story in which it occurs (such as the reference to Satanus' ancestry in \"The Cursed Earth\"). In either case, once a connection between two series was established, it was often repeated. For example, \"Top Dog\" was followed up by \"Judgement Day,\" and the reference to ''Flesh'' in ''Judge Dredd'' was reciprocated by the cameo appearance of a [[Judge (2000 AD)|Mega-City judge]] in ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]] Book V,'' which was itself a crossover with ''Flesh'' because it featured Satanus in a major role.\n\nThis latter example illustrates how series were not just linked to each other in pairs, but in multitudes. [[Pat Mills]], the first editor of ''2000 AD'' and creator of many enduring series, was responsible for many such connections. He deliberately connected his own series ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' to ''Flesh'', and then linked ''Nemesis'' to both. (All three series were created by him, but they had originally had nothing to do with each other.) For example, ''ABC Warriors'' made a passing reference to a dinosaur being the son of Satanus. Satanus himself subsequently played an important part in ''[[Nemesis the Warlock#Book V|Nemesis Book V]]'', by which time the entire cast of ''ABC Warriors'' had themselves moved to the ''Nemesis'' strip. This therefore established that ''Judge Dredd, Flesh, Nemesis,'' and ''ABC Warriors'' all existed in the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]: a list which would be added to many more times.\n\n===Spin-offs===\nSecondly, a new series can be created as a deliberate offshoot from a parent series. This can also occur in two ways. One method was to take a [[sidekick|supporting character]] from an existing series and start a new series with that character in the lead (sometimes with the lead character from the original series appearing in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]). Two examples are [[Judge Anderson]], first introduced in ''Judge Dredd'', being given her own series, ''Anderson: Psi Division,'' five years later; and [[Durham Red]] getting her own series after her debut in ''Strontium Dog''. Since ''Judge Dredd'' and ''Strontium Dog'' occupy the same universe, it follows that Anderson and Red do too (although they have never both appeared in the same story).\n\nAnother method was to create a brand new character for a new series, but to state from the outset that the story took place in an existing environment from an established strip. Most of the series in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' were created in this way. In ''2000 AD'' ''[[The 86ers]]'' was a series  set in the world of ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' which did not feature the established cast of its parent strip.\n\n=== Early issues ===\n\nIn the earliest issues and annuals, connections and crossovers would link up many of the earliest strips. The most prominent examples are ''Harlem Heroes'' ending and then the lead character's son turning up as a cadet judge in the next issue; ''The Cursed Earth'' linking Dredd's future to ''Flesh'' with Satanus, the cloned son of tyrannosaur One-Eye; and ''ABC Warriors'' starting as a prequel to ''Ro-Busters'', a sequel to ''Invasion!'', and then introducing a sequel to ''Flesh'' and ''The Cursed Earth'' with Satanus's son. Minor links included Ro-Jaws watching the Harlem Heroes and a comrade of Hammerstein referring to the under-construction Mega-City One in ''Ro-Busters'' flashbacks; a Mega-City Time Tour feature in an annual, where ''Flesh'' corporation Trans-Time offered holidays to both 2103 Mega-City One and 1999 Volgan-occupied England.<ref>Reprinted in ''Judge Dredd: The Restricted Files'' vol. 4</ref>\n\n===''Rogue Trooper''===\nThe series ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' was  both a crossover and a spin-off from itself. The original series ran in ''2000 AD'' from issues 228 to 635, when it ended. A completely [[Friday (2000 AD)|new series]] of ''Rogue Trooper'' then began in issue 650, by a different writer. This was not intended to be a sequel to the old version, but was a brand new, modernised reinterpretation of the character, with significant differences from the old version. It was not supposed to be set in the same universe or continuity, but was a total replacement (or \"[[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\") of both. However, years later and in the hands of a new writer, a story was written which established that the new and old Rogue Troopers were two different people inhabiting the same universe, and a convoluted continuity was contrived to explain their co-existence. In an unusually complicated crossover, the two Rogue Troopers actually met each other. This state of affairs did not continue for long, however, and the old version was killed off. Ironically, the new version declined in popularity and the strip was discontinued, only to be replaced with the original version, in stories set before the original's death.\n\nThere have been a number of less complicated ''Rogue Trooper'' spinoffs largely following the adventures of the other [[G.I. (comics)|G.I.s]], like [[Venus Bluegenes]], [[The 86ers|Rafaelle Blue]] and [[Tor Cyan]]. The new version of Rogue met Judge Dredd in a special story which took up the whole of issue 900 (the first time this had ever happened in what is usually an anthology comic containing five stories per issue).\n\n===''Laissez-faire'' approach===\nWhile ''2000 AD'' writers and editors have generally ensured that events occurring in spin-offs and their parent series are usually mutually consistent with each other, so that events in one such strip do not contradict events in another, much less care \u2013 if any \u2013 is taken to ensure a uniform continuity between crossover series. Therefore, while events which occur in the ''Anderson, Psi Division'' spin-off may have repercussions in ''Judge Dredd'' and ''vice versa'', the continuity of ''Strontium Dog'' might be ignored.\n\nThis can even occur within the crossover story itself: in \"Judgement Day\" Johnny Alpha travelled back in time from 2178 to 2114 to arrest a time-travelling criminal so he would not wipe out Earth (and thus, the future). The death of three billion people and destruction of five whole mega-cities then seemed to have no impact on Alpha's era. It was never explained in the story how an event as significant as a world war did not appear to be remembered by history in Alpha's era. On top of that, the future history of ''Strontium Dog'' bears little resemblance to ''Dredd'', with no mega-cities and mutants as an underclass in 'norm' cities in 2150. (''The Americans'' in Judge Dredd Megazine no. 283 implied that ''Strontium Dog's'' nuclear war ''will'' occur in 2150, but this was a [[MacGuffin]] to drive the story forward.)\n\nIn these cases, the crossover is not a serious attempt at world-building and continuity, simply a means of having two popular characters meet. Writer [[John Wagner]] has even stated that he does not view ''Strontium Dog'' and ''Judge Dredd'' as being in the same continuity.<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Wagner/22334044612?ref=mf Wagner's Facebook page], statement in reply to a November 6, 2009 comment</ref>\n\nWriters have also changed their minds over time. In the 2000s ''ABC Warriors'' stories, there is no attempt at fitting the Volgan War into Dredd's timeline or ''Harlem Heroes'' (but he does refer to ''Nemesis The Warlock'' in ''Dredd: Blood of Satanus II'', in order to declare ''Satanus Unchained'' out of canon). Other writers have also made no mention of this, and generally do not link up non-Dredd strips. It is also a habit of writers who created a strip to ignore the work of others if they feel like it. The John Wagner story ''Origins'' refers to Pat Mills' ''Dredd'' stories but makes no attempt to acknowledge ''Invasion!'', ''ABC Warriors'', and ''Ro-Busters'' (or ''Harlem Heroes''); ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'' acknowledges and retcons his death under Alan Grant, but deliberately erases ''Strontium Dogs'' (with a narrator calling Peter Hogan's strips the work of \"notorious fantasist Ho Gan\"). In the sequel series ''Savage'', Mills acknowledges the original ''Invasion!'' (to the extent that there's a King Charles III in the 2000s, just as prog 1 said) but ignores the prequel strip ''Disaster 1990!''. And while ''Harlem Heroes'' was linked to ''Dredd'', the sequel strip ''Inferno'' was left separate until Al Ewing's ''Dredd Year One: Wear Iron'' novella.\n\n==Crossovers==\nAs most of the ''2000 AD'' crossovers occur on the same timeline, not in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], the majority of crossovers take place thanks to the widespread, but temperamental, [[time travel]] technology that was invented at the beginning of the 22nd century.\n\n===Stories by Pat Mills===\n[[Pat Mills]] was responsible for the majority of the crossovers.\n\n*''Judge Dredd'': \"[[The Cursed Earth (Judge Dredd story)|The Cursed Earth]]\" introduced the dinosaur [[Satanus (comics)|Satanus]] and linked ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' to ''[[Flesh (comics)|Flesh]]''.<ref>Mills, Pat (2017) ''Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History'' (Millsverse Books), p. 103</ref>\n*''[[ABC Warriors]]'': \"Golgotha\", in the first series, featured the son of Satanus and linked ''ABC Warriors'' to ''Flesh''.\n*''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]'': \"[[Nemesis the Warlock#Book Four|Book IV:]] The Gothic Empire\" introduced both the ABC Warriors and the [[Ro-Jaws]] character from ''[[Ro-Busters]]'' to Nemesis. \"[[Nemesis the Warlock#Book Five|Book V:]] The Vengeance of Thoth\" featured the return of Satanus in a major role, and a cameo by a judge of Mega-City One, linking ''Nemesis'' to ''Flesh'' and ''Judge Dredd''. In a later ''Dredd'' strip by Mills, Dredd referred to Satanus' return to the [[Cretaceous]] in ''Nemesis'' (how he knew about it was not explained).\n*[[Hammerstein (comics)#Hammerstein in Judge Dredd|''Judge Dredd'': \"Hammerstein\"]] featured ABC Warrior [[Hammerstein (comics)|Hammerstein]] in the Cursed Earth outside Mega-City One, following the [[Atomic Wars]] started by President [[President Robert L. Booth|Booth]] in 2070. This linked ''ABC Warriors'' to ''Judge Dredd'', in addition to the existing Satanus connection. (This link was retconned away in other strips.)\n*The [[Volgans]] appear as the enemies of Bill Savage in ''[[Invasion! (2000 AD)|Invasion!]]'', and also in early episodes of ''ABC Warriors'' as the enemies of the character [[Hammerstein (robot)#Character history|Hammerstein]] and the creators of the ABC warrior Blackblood. Flashback stories have shown more of the Volgan War, and Volgan robot Volkhan was introduced as a 'present' day villain in ''The Volgan War Book One''.\n*''[[Bill Savage|Savage]]'' ''Books 5, 6 ''and'' 7'' included characters and backstory from ''[[Ro-Busters]]''.\n*Another ''ABC Warriors'' story in 2012, \"Return to Earth,\" established further links between ''Savage'' and ''Ro-Busters''.<ref>''2000 AD'' progs 1800-1812</ref>\n\n===Stories by Ian Edginton===\nWriter [[Ian Edginton]] has begun linking his pseudo-historical strips together, both covertly and overtly. Images of both Jack Dancer from ''[[The Red Seas]]'' and [[Hastur]] from ''[[Leviathan (comic)|Leviathan]]'' later appeared in ''[[Stickleback (comics)|Stickleback]]''; the pub \"The Jolly Cripple\", a haunt of the ''Red Seas'' pirates, reappears as the haunt of the character Detective Valentine and contains a portrait of the original proprietress from ''Red Seas'';<ref>[http://disraeli-demon.blogspot.com/2007/01/references-in-stickleback-parts-1-2.html D'Blog of 'Israeli: References In Stickleback Parts 1 & 2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and ''Leviathan'' villain William Ashbless briefly appears in ''Stickleback'' as a member of the sinister City Fathers group.<ref>[http://disraeli-demon.blogspot.com/2007/02/stickleback-part-8-references.html D'Blog of 'Israeli: Stickleback Part 8 References<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the second ''Stickleback'', the eponymous lead visits the London-based Brotherhood of the Book from ''The Red Seas'', in the process meeting (and revealing history with) ''Seas'' villain Orlando Doyle. There is also an appearance by Herbert Sewell, an unfortunate and long-suffering scientist/time traveller in Edginton's ''Judge Dredd'' stories, being dragged into [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]; and an ogre of the same species seen in Edginton's ''American Gothic'' Wild West strip is seen at the villain's Wild West show. ''The Red Seas'' would later reveal that ''Stickleback's'' Orlando was from an alternate universe, and that the Brotherhood of the Book exists in multiple universes.\n\n''Ampney Crucis Investigates'' made the connections stronger: characters referred to the Leviathan ship and the myth of the Hollow Earth from ''The Red Seas''; the otherworldly monsters were given a similar background as in ''Stickleback''; and a shadowy antagonist was shown to have a staff with a bust of Hastur's head. Stickleback's son appears in the fourth ''Ampney Crucis'' story as an adult, London's crime lord in an alternate dimension where the [[First World War]] never happened; in the same world, an underground society of cyborg fanatics called \"Babbagists\" has sprung up around the works of Countess Bernoulli, a ''Stickleback'' villain.\n\n===Stories by John Smith===\nThe writer [[John Smith (comics writer)|John Smith]] often places a number of his characters in the same stories, which has become known among fans as [[Smithiverse|The Smithiverse]]. These have never been explicitly linked to the other ''2000 AD'' stories, but stand together as an independent universe of their own. However, one particular species of alien of Smith's creation has appeared in both the Smithiverse (in ''[[Firekind]]'' and ''[[Tyranny Rex]]'') and in a ''Judge Dredd'' universe story (''Pussyfoot 5'', a spin-off from ''Devlin Waugh'').\n\nSmithiverse stories include ''[[Indigo Prime]]'', ''[[Tyranny Rex]]'' and ''[[Firekind]]''.\n\n===Stories by other writers===\n\n====Judge Dredd stories====\n\nA number of characters have appeared in Judge Dredd stories (or vice versa).\n\n=====Ant Wars=====\nDredd spinoff ''Zancudo!'' by [[Simon Spurrier]] revealed itself to be a sequel to ''Ant Wars'', a 1970s strip about giant ants rampaging through South America, in the cliffhanger ending to Part 2. The giant ants were revealed to be living in the jungles near [[Ciudad Barranquilla]], and were at war with the giant mosquitos that formed the strip's villains.\n\n=====Harlem Heroes=====\nThe first [[Judge Giant]] was the son of Giant of the [[Harlem Heroes]], and his father was shown upon Giant's graduation from the Academy of Law.<ref>\"The Academy of Law\" (by [[John Wagner]])</ref> Later on, Judge Giant Jr (the first Judge Giant's son) would meet his aged grandfather a few days before he died.<ref>Judge Dredd Megazine #216</ref>\n\n=====Rogue Trooper=====\n[[Southers|Souther]] troops flee Nu-Earth back through time to Mega-City One in 2116.

Due to the distortion of reality, characters from dozens of 2000 AD strips made cameo appearances, either in the background or as parts of the plot (Dredd is attacked by the vampires from ''Fiends of the Eastern Front'' and then has to avoid Old One-Eye from ''Flesh'').\n\n=====Judge Dredd: \"The Cold Deck\" and \"Trifecta\"=====\n''The Cold Deck'' was a story written by [[Al Ewing]] which ran in ''2000 AD'' at the same time as two other series set in Dredd's world, ''[[Jack Point|The Simping Detective]]'' and ''[[Low Life (comics)|Low Life]]''. These stories initially appeared to have no other connection with each other, but after each of them had been running independently for a couple of issues their plotlines unexpectedly intertwined with each other, and it became apparent that Ewing had collaborated with the writers of the other two series, [[Simon Spurrier]] and [[Rob Williams (comics)|Rob Williams]], to create a single large crossover story. The three series merged into a single story for their concluding part, called ''[[Trifecta (Judge Dredd story)|Trifecta]]'', which took up every page of ''2000 AD'' #1812.\n\n====Rogue Trooper and Mercy Heights====\n*''Rogue Trooper'': \"Blue on Blue\" and sequels joined together the original and new versions of the character in the same continuity (see above).\n*''Mercy Heights'' was initially a new series with no connection to ''Rogue Trooper.'' When the series ended [[Tor Cyan]], a character from the series, began his own [[eponym]]ous series, in which it was eventually revealed that he was a [[G.I. (comics)|genetic infantryman]] like Rogue Trooper.\n\n==Spin-offs==\nThis list does not include direct sequels, such as ''Inferno'' and ''Savage''.\n\n===Judge Dredd spin-offs===\n{{Main|Judge Dredd Megazine}}\nJudge Dredd spin-offs include:\n*''[[Judge Anderson|Anderson: Psi Division]]''\n*''[[Armitage (comics)|Armitage]]''\n*''[[Banzai Battalion]]''\n*''[[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]]''\n*''[[Cursed Earth Koburn]]''\n*''[[The Dead Man]]''\n*''Devlin Waugh''\n**''[[Pussyfoot 5]]''\n*''[[Judge Janus|Janus: Psi Division]]''\n*''[[Judge Death]]''\n*''[[Judge Hershey]]''\n*''[[Juliet November]]''\n*''[[Mean Machine Angel|Mean Machine]]''\n*''[[Judge Grice#Purgatory|Purgatory]]''\n*''[[Red Razors]]''\n*''[[Inspector Shimura|Shimura]]''\n*''[[Jack Point (the Simping Detective)|The Simping Detective]]''\n*''[[Tales from the Black Museum]]''\n*''Walter the Wobot''\n\n===Rogue Trooper spin-offs===\nThe original ''[[Rogue Trooper]]'' led to:\n*The new version, [[Friday (2000 AD)|\"Friday\"]]\n*[[Venus Bluegenes]]\n*[[The 86ers]]\n*[[Rogue Trooper#Jaegir|Jaegir]]\n*Hunted\n\n''See also'' [[Tor Cyan]]\n\n===Other spin-offs===\n*''[[ABC Warriors]]'' was a spin-off from ''[[Ro-Busters]]''\n*''[[Deadlock (2000 AD)|Deadlock]]'' was a spin-off from ''[[ABC Warriors]]''\n*''[[Durham Red]]'', ''[[Young Middenface]]'', ''Tales From the Doghouse'' and ''Strontium Dogs'' were spin-offs from ''[[Strontium Dog]]''\n*''[[Tor Cyan]]'' was a spin-off from ''Mercy Heights''\n\n==Parallel universes==\nAs well as the tying together of a lot of the stories in ''2000 AD'', other [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] are known to co-exist alongside the main one, and some of them have intruded into it. Most famously in ''Judge Dredd'', this has happened with [[Judge Death]] and the [[Dark Judges]], coming from a reality where life is a crime. The aforementioned \"Helter Skelter\" had a wide range of deceased villains coming from alternate dimensions where they had won, and \"Rehab\" (progs 1644-8) featured an incursion from a utopian Earth where the Judges are pacifists focused on rehabilitation.\n\nSince 2003, ''Sinister Dexter'' has been running a storyline where criminals from a parallel Earth, led by \"Holy\" Moses Tanenbaum (dead in the main universe), have been trying to take over the city of Downlode in the main universe. When the other Earth was shown, it was revealed a major reason for the move was that China (\"the ChiComs\") were winning a war against Russia and rapidly advancing towards Downlode. The final part saw Sinister and Dexter chasing a target through other ''2000 AD'' strips, which turned out to be other realities.\n\n==Intercompany crossovers==\n[[Image:Lobo JudgeDredd panel.JPG|200px|thumb|Judge Dredd meets [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. Art by [[Val Semeiks]].]]\nThere have been numerous [[intercompany crossover]]s between ''2000 AD'' stories and with stories published by other companies ([[DC Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]]). Given his high profile these often mix other characters with [[Judge Dredd]]. These include:\n\n===Aliens===\n{{Main|Judge Dredd vs. Aliens}}\n\n[[List of minor characters in Judge Dredd#Mr Bones|Mr Bones]] eventually manages to launch his revenge on Mega-City One, unleashing the [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorph]] (called the [[Incubus (demon)|Incubus]] here) into the Grand Hall of Justice itself.<ref>''[[Judge Dredd vs. Aliens]]: Incubus'' (written by [[John Wagner]] and [[Andy Diggle]], with art by [[Henry Flint]], in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' #1332\u20131335, [[2003 in comics|2003]], [[Trade paperback (comics)|tpb]], 104 pages, [[Rebellion Developments]], 2003, {{ISBN|1-904265-10-3}}, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], [[2004 in comics|2004]], {{ISBN|1-56971-983-7}})<br />[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=ALIENS Aliens crossover publication details]</ref> The story has been mentioned a few times, though the xenomorph's exact origin was kept quiet.\n\n===Batman===\n{{Main|Judgement on Gotham}}\n\nThere have been four crossovers with [[Batman]]: a team-up with Dredd to defeat the combined might of [[Judge Death]], Mean Machine, and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]], with the two heroes clashing; Dredd going to [[Gotham City]] to save Batman from the Ventriloquist; both heroes being part of a faked deathmatch run by the Riddler; and [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] and the Dark Judges teaming up, with the Joker becoming a fifth Dark Judge.<ref>''[[Judgement on Gotham]]'' (written by [[John Wagner]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], with art by [[Simon Bisley]], [[graphic novel]], [[1991 in comics|1991]]) and three sequels <br />[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&Comic=Specials&choice=BATMAN Batman crossover publication details]</ref>\n\nThe Batman crossovers have had significant impact on Dredd's world. A vision of the fourth crossover, ''Die Laughing'', causing Cassandra Anderson to return to being a Judge, as the crossover was written before she had quit and had been delayed. Judge Death was finally captured due to the events of ''Judgement on Gotham''. ''Die Laughing'' had the Dark Judges encased in plasteen crystals, which is how they would always be shown in later stories and the ''[[Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death]]'' video game; the 2002 story ''My Name is Death'' had Dredd refer to \"that Gotham clown\".\n\n===Lobo===\n[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], the intergalactic [[mercenary]], became a popular character when [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] took on the writing duties so a run-in with Dredd was a logical progression.<ref>''Judge Dredd vs. [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]: Psycho-Bikers vs The Mutants From Hell'' (written by [[John Wagner]] and [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], with pencils by [[Val Semeiks]], inks by [[John Dell]] and colours by [[Gloria Vasquez]], 48 pages, DC, [[1995 in comics|1995]], {{ISBN|1-56389-239-1}}) <br />[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=thrill&page=profiles&choice=LOBO Lobo crossover publication details]</ref>\n\n===Predator===\n{{Main|Predator vs. Judge Dredd}}\n\n[[Predator (alien)|The Predator]] has made many visits to Earth throughout history, and in a number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]], so it was almost inevitable that they would eventually clash with Dredd.

However writer [[Dave Stone]], who has written several ''Judge Dredd'' and ''Doctor Who'' novels, planned a crossover novel featuring both Dredd and the Doctor, called \"[[Burning Heart (novel)|Burning Heart]].\" This idea was cancelled due to the lack of success of the [[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|1995 ''Judge Dredd'' film]], and the book was published in 1997 as a ''Dr Who'' book without Dredd.<ref>\"I, Who\" Lars Pearson, Sidewinder Press, 1999</ref><ref>[http://finnclark.thiswaydown.org/Review/BurningHeart.html FinnClark.org (book review)]</ref> The Virgin Books ''Who'' stories featured the Guild of Adjudicators, a law enforcement agency who were often presented as similar to the Judges.\n\nIn the revived television series, the episode ''[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]'' was based on Mega-City One, and one character was deliberately dressed like [[Max Normal]].

Located in [[Hong Kong]], SPYC is an [[Medium of instruction|English medium of instruction]] (EMI) secondary school fully subsidised by the government with 4 classes each for Forms 1 to 5 and 5 classes for Form 6 (in the 2018/19 academic year). The school icon is an [[eagle]] symbolising [[courage]] and [[determination]].\n\n==School history==\n[[Rev Henry Noyes]], the school founder, was a minister of the U.S. Presbyterian Church. In 1879 he founded a beginners' school called An Hwoh School in Saki, [[Guangzhou]], offering Mathematics and Science. With a lot of hard work, Pui Ying emerged and bloomed. A chain of schools was established in Guangzhou, [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Jiangmen]] and Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1978, to celebrate the centennial, the Board of Directors established the 5th school; an Anglo-Chinese School named Shatin Pui Ying College, with [[Wong Wai Wah]] as the Principal. In the first year, the school operated on the campus of [[Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School]] at Lek Yuen Estate. In September 1979, the school could at last move into the 24-classroom premises in [[Wo Che]] Estate. The school [[library]] was opened in September 1982.\n\nIn order to enable the promotion of all Form 3 students to Form 4 in the school, the school altered the class structure to a symmetrical one. The [[Student Union]] was set up in September 1995 and [[Parent-Teacher Association]] in 1996. In 1996, Principal Wong retired and was succeeded by Vice Principal [[Yau Oi Yuen]]. The mixed ability classes replaced the elite system in September 1996.

In 1879 he founded a beginners' school called An Hwoh School in Saki, [[Guangzhou]], offering Mathematics and Science. With a lot of hard work, Pui Ying emerged and bloomed. A chain of schools was established in Guangzhou, [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Jiangmen]] and Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1978, to celebrate the centennial, the Board of Directors established the 5th school; an Anglo-Chinese School named Shatin Pui Ying College, with [[Wong Wai Wah]] as the Principal. In the first year, the school operated on the campus of [[Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School]] at Lek Yuen Estate. In September 1979, the school could at last move into the 24-classroom premises in [[Wo Che]] Estate. The school [[library]] was opened in September 1982.\n\nIn order to enable the promotion of all Form 3 students to Form 4 in the school, the school altered the class structure to a symmetrical one. The [[Student Union]] was set up in September 1995 and [[Parent-Teacher Association]] in 1996. In 1996, Principal Wong retired and was succeeded by Vice Principal [[Yau Oi Yuen]]. The mixed ability classes replaced the elite system in September 1996. In September 2015, Principal Yau retired and was succeeded by Vice Principal Chan Lai Fan, while Chan Tak Nam succeeded as Vice Principal.\n\nThe new wing building of the school has been in use since July 2005.
