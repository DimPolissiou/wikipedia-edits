Their first product, the Fairlight, was a glass-fibre body shell priced at \u00a349 for fitting to a Ford 8 or 10&nbsp;hp chassis.<ref name=car_mechanics>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Car Mechanics magazine advert |year=1959}}</ref> The first car, not destined for production, which subsequently became known as the Ginetta G1, was based on a pre-war [[Wolseley Hornet six]].<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |last=Georgano |first=N.   | authorlink=G.N. Georgano |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>\n\nThe four Walklett brothers each had their areas of expertise: Bob was the Managing Director, Douglas was the mechanical engineer and also handled the electrical work, Ivor was the designer and Trevers was the stylist, working closely with Ivor.\n\nFrom their original base, the company moved to [[Witham]], [[Essex]], in 1962, and between 1972 and 1974 operated from larger premises in Ballingdon Street adjacent to the railway bridge [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], before returning to Witham. In 1988, the Walklett brothers needed bigger premises and so moved the company to [[Scunthorpe]] where they could expand. On 7 November 1989, the Walkletts sold Ginetta to an international group of enthusiasts, based in [[Sheffield]] and run by managing director Martin Phaff. Ginetta was in a strong financial position at the time of its sale and the Walkletts went on to retire.\n\nUnder Phaff, the company went on to produce the Ginetta G20 and the Ginetta G33. It was during this period that the company hit troubled times.\n\n===21st century===\nIn late 2005, Ginetta was acquired by LNT Automotive, a company run by race car driver, engineer and businessman [[Lawrence Tomlinson]]. His aims were in line with the founders; to produce innovative, capable and great value sports cars.\n\nIn mid-2007, Ginetta moved to a factory near Leeds, with a target to sell 200 cars per year. Tomlinson himself penned the base specification for the [[Ginetta G50]], which marked 50 years of Ginetta production and became a successful [[GT4 European Cup|GT4]] car.\n\nIn March 2010, Ginetta acquired the [[Somerset]]-based sports car manufacturer Farbio, and re-badged their car as the [[Ginetta F400]]. In March 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G55|G55]], which competed in the [[Michelin]] [[Ginetta GT Supercup]] and was built to comply to the GT3 class regulations. In October 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G60|G60]], a two-door mid-engine sports car developed from the F400 and powered by a Ford-sourced 3.7-litre V6 engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/Ginetta-G60-2011-CAR-review/|title=Ginetta G60 (2011) CAR review|accessdate=21 October 2011|publisher=Car Magazine|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nModels produced by Ginetta include the following:\n\n===G2===\nGinetta's first car, the G2, was produced as a [[kit car]] for enthusiasts and consisted of a tubular frame chassis to take Ford components and aluminium body. About 100 were produced.\n\n===G3 and G4===\n[[File:Markg4.jpg|thumb|right|1964-1968 Ginetta G4R]]\nThe G3 was introduced with a glass fibre body in 1959 to be followed by the G4 in 1961.<ref>For road test see ''Motor Sport'', September 1962, Pages 690, 693.</ref>\n\nThe G4 used the new Ford 105E engine and had a glass fibre GT-style body along with the suspension updated to coil springing at the front with a Ford live axle at the rear. Whereas the G2 and G3 had been designed for racing, the G4 was usable as an everyday car but still was very competitive in motor sport with numerous successes. In 1963, a coup\u00e9 variant was introduced alongside the open top variant and a BMC axle replaced the Ford unit at the rear.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1963, Pages 345-346.</ref> In road tests, the car attains a top speed of  {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a 1,500&nbsp;cc engine.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1964, Pages 260-261.</ref> The series III version of 1966 added pop-up headlights. Production stopped in 1968 but was revived in 1981 with the Series IV which was two inches wider and three inches (76&nbsp;mm) longer than the III. Over 500 units were made up to 1969 with a variety of Ford engines. \n{{-}}\n\n===G10, G11 and G12===\n[[File:1965 Ginetta G12 sn 25.jpg|thumb|right|Ginetta G12]]\nLaunched at the 1965 Racing car show, the Ginetta G10 was meant to be a more powerful racing car than its predecessors. Weighing around {{cvt|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and fitted with a {{cvt|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], it was well received by the enthusiasts. Ginetta works driver Chris Meek secured a win with a prototype at the car's debut at Brands Hatch, beating a [[Jaguar E-Type]] which was considered to be the most successful GT racing car. However Ginetta failed to make a homologated version of the G10 in order for it to keep competing and as a result, it was forced out of the competition with a total production of only three cars. Following the reception the G10 had generated, Ginetta produced the G11, a street legal version of the G10 with the same body but with the Ford V8 replaced by the MGB 1800 engine. However, slow deliveries of the engine curbed production of the car and therefore only a handful were made.<ref>https://www.dkeng.co.uk/press/1451909267-94fe01c5a552f5a3b1ba64b0dcd53506.pdf|Ginetta G10 and G11</ref>\n\nUnveiled in 1966, the G12 was an evolution of the G4 but had many new features that made it stand apart from its predecessors. The car had a new tubular steel space frame chassis, with the cockpit section mounted to it for extra strength, while removable body work allowed for easy repair. The front suspension consisted of Triumph-derived uprights and double wishbones (with camber adjustment courtesy of rose-joints on the upper items) and coil springs. While, at the rear, the usual arrangement of single upper transverse links with lower reversed wishbones (with rose-joints) and radius arms was present, along with coil springs. The car was fitted with anti-roll bars for increased safety, and the Triumph-sourced Girling disc brakes at the front and rear ensured increased stopping power. Power came from a 1.0-litre Cosworth SCA [[inline-four engine]], though larger engines were fitted later such as an [[Aston Martin]] V8, but were less successful. The G12 dominated the competition in its class, outclassing [[Lotus Elan|Lotus Elan 26R]]s and [[Coventry Climax]]es, winning the 1,150&nbsp;cc MN series. Outside track racing, the G12 also found success at hill climb events, before it was replaced by the G16. Approximately 28 were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-2008/126/ginetta-g12|title=Ginetta G12|work=Motorsport Magazine|date=October 2008|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===G15===\n{{main|Ginetta G15}}\n[[File:Ginetta G15 875cc August 1972.JPG|thumb|1969 [[Ginetta G15]]]]\nIn 1967 the [[Ginetta G15|G15]], utilizing a rear-mounted 875&nbsp;cc [[Sunbeam Imp]] engine, was launched.<ref name=Sedgwick>Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 82</ref> This two-seat coup\u00e9 had a glass fibre body bolted to a tube chassis and used Imp rear and Triumph front suspension.

Called the GRS Tora Mark I it was first shown in October 1982, going on sale the next year. Although it was a two-door estate, it used the somewhat short front doors of a four-door Hunter, leading to limited rear seat access and somewhat awkward proportions. More troubling was that the Hunter's fuel tank and filler location meant that the rear gate opening was very high, limiting the cars utility. In October 1983, a GRS Tora Pickup was shown.<ref name=pyman2>[[#TP1|Pyman]], p. 6</ref> In August 1984 the GRS Tora Mark II started deliveries.<ref name=pyman2/> This version rectified the concerns with the rear opening, with a relocated fuel tank (and filler now mounted on the flank of the car) allowing for a full-height rear gate. Being more expensive than the simpler Mark I model the two were offered side by side. Sales of the GRS Tora helped Ginetta stay afloat in the 1980s, but by 1988 Tora production gradually came to a halt as the market was changing and donor cars were becoming rarer.\n\nAt the July 1989 Newark Kit Car Show, Ginetta showed a GRS Tora Mark III - unlike previous models, this was a four-door estate (of a rather beefy appearance) on [[Ford Cortina]] saloon underpinnings. It used the doors as well as the taillights of a Mark IV Cortina four-door saloon, and had Cortina engines or the option of a Perkins diesel. Only two were built, and Ginetta went back to its main business of making sports cars. All in all, about 320 Toras of all variants were built.<ref name=pyman1/>\n\n===G26, G27, G28, G30 and G31===\n{{multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = 200\n|image1= 1989 Ginetta G26 2.0 Front.jpg\n|caption1= Ginetta G26\n|image2= 1988 Ginetta G30 (front left).jpg\n|caption2= Ginetta G28\n|image3= Ginetta-G27-series3.jpg\n|caption3= Ginetta G27\n}}\nFollowing reorganisation, the company moved to [[Scunthorpe]] and started making cars in kit form again in the 1980s starting with the G27 and followed by the G26, G28, G30 and G31, with all cars using Ford parts. The G26 and G31 both used flip-up headlamps; the G26 and G30 were fastback coup\u00e9s while the G28 and G31 had a notchback profile.\n\nThe G27, which was introduced in November 1985, was a two-seater sports car derived from the G4.<ref name=Observer's_1986>John Bladon, The New Observer's Book of Automobiles, Twenty-ninth edition, 1986, page 79</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===G32 and G33===\n{{multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = 200\n|image1= Ginetta G33 V8.jpg\n|caption1= 1992 Ginetta G33\n|image2= G32 front.jpg\n|caption2= Ginetta G32\n}}\nIt was decided to re-enter the complete car business with the mid-engined [[Ginetta G32|G32]] with a choice of 1.6- or 1.9-litre four-cylinder engine, available as a coup\u00e9 or convertible and the G33 speedster which was equipped with a 3.9-litre [[Rover V8]] capable of a top speed of {{convert|145|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a 0-97&nbsp;km/h acceleration time of 5 seconds.

Their first product, the Fairlight, was a glass-fibre body shell priced at \u00a349 for fitting to a Ford 8 or 10&nbsp;hp chassis.<ref name=car_mechanics>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Car Mechanics magazine advert |year=1959}}</ref> The first car, not destined for production, which subsequently became known as the Ginetta G1, was based on a pre-war [[Wolseley Hornet six]].<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |last=Georgano |first=N.   | authorlink=G.N. Georgano |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>\n\nThe four Walklett brothers each had their areas of expertise: Bob was the Managing Director, Douglas was the mechanical engineer and also handled the electrical work, Ivor was the designer and Trevers was the stylist, working closely with Ivor.\n\nFrom their original base, the company moved to [[Witham]], [[Essex]], in 1962, and between 1972 and 1974 operated from larger premises in Ballingdon Street adjacent to the railway bridge [[Sudbury, Suffolk]], before returning to Witham. In 1988, the Walklett brothers needed bigger premises and so moved the company to [[Scunthorpe]] where they could expand. On 7 November 1989, the Walkletts sold Ginetta to an international group of enthusiasts, based in [[Sheffield]] and run by managing director Martin Phaff. Ginetta was in a strong financial position at the time of its sale and the Walkletts went on to retire.\n\nUnder Phaff, the company went on to produce the Ginetta G20 and the Ginetta G33. It was during this period that the company hit troubled times.\n\n===21st century===\nIn late 2005, Ginetta was acquired by LNT Automotive, a company run by race car driver, engineer and businessman [[Lawrence Tomlinson]]. His aims were in line with the founders; to produce innovative, capable and great value sports cars.\n\nIn mid-2007, Ginetta moved to a factory near Leeds, with a target to sell 200 cars per year. Tomlinson himself penned the base specification for the [[Ginetta G50]], which marked 50 years of Ginetta production and became a successful [[GT4 European Cup|GT4]] car.\n\nIn March 2010, Ginetta acquired the [[Somerset]]-based sports car manufacturer Farbio, and re-badged their car as the [[Ginetta F400]]. In March 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G55|G55]], which competed in the [[Michelin]] [[Ginetta GT Supercup]] and was built to comply to the GT3 class regulations. In October 2011, Ginetta launched the [[Ginetta G60|G60]], a two-door mid-engine sports car developed from the F400 and powered by a Ford-sourced 3.7-litre V6 engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/Ginetta-G60-2011-CAR-review/|title=Ginetta G60 (2011) CAR review|accessdate=21 October 2011|publisher=Car Magazine|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nModels produced by Ginetta include the following:\n\n===G2===\nGinetta's first car, the G2, was produced as a [[kit car]] for enthusiasts and consisted of a tubular frame chassis to take Ford components and aluminium body. About 100 were produced.\n\n===G3 and G4===\n[[File:Markg4.jpg|thumb|right|1964-1968 Ginetta G4R]]\nThe G3 was introduced with a glass fibre body in 1959 to be followed by the G4 in 1961.<ref>For road test see ''Motor Sport'', September 1962, Pages 690, 693.</ref>\n\nThe G4 used the new Ford 105E engine and had a glass fibre GT-style body along with the suspension updated to coil springing at the front with a Ford live axle at the rear. Whereas the G2 and G3 had been designed for racing, the G4 was usable as an everyday car but still was very competitive in motor sport with numerous successes. In 1963, a coup\u00e9 variant was introduced alongside the open top variant and a BMC axle replaced the Ford unit at the rear.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1963, Pages 345-346.</ref> In road tests, the car attains a top speed of  {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} with a 1,500&nbsp;cc engine.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1964, Pages 260-261.</ref> The series III version of 1966 added pop-up headlights. Production stopped in 1968 but was revived in 1981 with the Series IV which was two inches wider and three inches (76&nbsp;mm) longer than the III. Over 500 units were made up to 1969 with a variety of Ford engines. \n{{-}}\n\n===G10, G11 and G12===\n[[File:1965 Ginetta G12 sn 25.jpg|thumb|right|Ginetta G12]]\nLaunched at the 1965 Racing car show, the Ginetta G10 was meant to be a more powerful racing car than its predecessors. Weighing around {{cvt|900|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and fitted with a {{cvt|289|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine from the [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], it was well received by the enthusiasts. Ginetta works driver Chris Meek secured a win with a prototype at the car's debut at Brands Hatch, beating a [[Jaguar E-Type]] which was considered to be the most successful GT racing car. However Ginetta failed to make a homologated version of the G10 in order for it to keep competing and as a result, it was forced out of the competition with a total production of only three cars. Following the reception the G10 had generated, Ginetta produced the G11, a street legal version of the G10 with the same body but with the Ford V8 replaced by the MGB 1800 engine. However, slow deliveries of the engine curbed production of the car and therefore only a handful were made.<ref>https://www.dkeng.co.uk/press/1451909267-94fe01c5a552f5a3b1ba64b0dcd53506.pdf|Ginetta G10 and G11</ref>\n\nUnveiled in 1966, the G12 was an evolution of the G4 but had many new features that made it stand apart from its predecessors. The car had a new tubular steel space frame chassis, with the cockpit section mounted to it for extra strength, while removable body work allowed for easy repair. The front suspension consisted of Triumph-derived uprights and double wishbones (with camber adjustment courtesy of rose-joints on the upper items) and coil springs. While, at the rear, the usual arrangement of single upper transverse links with lower reversed wishbones (with rose-joints) and radius arms was present, along with coil springs. The car was fitted with anti-roll bars for increased safety, and the Triumph-sourced Girling disc brakes at the front and rear ensured increased stopping power. Power came from a 1.0-litre Cosworth SCA [[inline-four engine]], though larger engines were fitted later such as an [[Aston Martin]] V8, but were less successful. The G12 dominated the competition in its class, outclassing [[Lotus Elan|Lotus Elan 26R]]s and [[Coventry Climax]]es, winning the 1,150&nbsp;cc MN series. Outside track racing, the G12 also found success at hill climb events, before it was replaced by the G16. Approximately 28 were built.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/october-2008/126/ginetta-g12|title=Ginetta G12|work=Motorsport Magazine|date=October 2008|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===G15===\n{{main|Ginetta G15}}\n[[File:Ginetta G15 875cc August 1972.JPG|thumb|1969 [[Ginetta G15]]]]\nIn 1967 the [[Ginetta G15|G15]], utilizing a rear-mounted 875&nbsp;cc [[Sunbeam Imp]] engine, was launched.<ref name=Sedgwick>Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 82</ref> This two-seat coup\u00e9 had a glass fibre body bolted to a tube chassis and used Imp rear and Triumph front suspension.

Called the GRS Tora Mark I it was first shown in October 1982, going on sale the next year. Although it was a two-door estate, it used the somewhat short front doors of a four-door Hunter, leading to limited rear seat access and somewhat awkward proportions. More troubling was that the Hunter's fuel tank and filler location meant that the rear gate opening was very high, limiting the cars utility. In October 1983, a GRS Tora Pickup was shown.<ref name=pyman2>[[#TP1|Pyman]], p. 6</ref> In August 1984 the GRS Tora Mark II started deliveries.<ref name=pyman2/> This version rectified the concerns with the rear opening, with a relocated fuel tank (and filler now mounted on the flank of the car) allowing for a full-height rear gate. Being more expensive than the simpler Mark I model the two were offered side by side. Sales of the GRS Tora helped Ginetta stay afloat in the 1980s, but by 1988 Tora production gradually came to a halt as the market was changing and donor cars were becoming rarer.\n\nAt the July 1989 Newark Kit Car Show, Ginetta showed a GRS Tora Mark III - unlike previous models, this was a four-door estate (of a rather beefy appearance) on [[Ford Cortina]] saloon underpinnings. It used the doors as well as the taillights of a Mark IV Cortina four-door saloon, and had Cortina engines or the option of a Perkins diesel. Only two were built, and Ginetta went back to its main business of making sports cars.

Offering a 3.7-litre V6 engine generating a maximum power output of {{cvt|380|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, the car provided Ginetta with the basis for their Ginetta G55 GT3 car; a larger spec car which gives GT teams a 4.35L V8 powerplant.\n{{-}}\n\n===Akula===\n[[File:Ginetta Akula Genf 2019 1Y7A5901.jpg|thumb|[[Ginetta Akula]]]]\nOn 5 March 2019 at the [[Geneva International Motor Show]], Ginetta announced a new 600hp supercar called the Akula - Russian for \"shark\".\n{{-}}\n\n==Motorsport==\n===Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup===\n{{main|Ginetta GT4 Supercup}}\nThe [[Ginetta GT4 Supercup|Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup]] is a single-class race series which features both the [[Ginetta G50]] and [[Ginetta G55|G55]] sports cars; running in support of the [[British Touring Car Championship]].\n\nThe championship began as the Ginetta G50 Cup in 2008, supporting the [[British Formula 3 International Series|British Formula Three Championship]] and [[British GT Championship]]. In 2009 it moved to support the BTCC. In 2011, with the introduction of the Ginetta G55, the championship became the [[Ginetta GT4 Supercup|Michelin Ginetta GT4 SuperCup]].\n\nThe 2014 season will be the fourth running of the Michelin Ginetta GT4 Supercup, but it will be the first year in which the G50 GT4 and G55 GT4 cars are consolidated into one single class. In order to maintain fair competition, the two models will be equalised through a balance of performance test.\n\n===Protyre Motorsport Ginetta GT5 Challenge===\n{{main|Ginetta GT5 Challenge}}\n\nThe Protyre Motorsport [[Ginetta GT5 Challenge]] offers a unique, low-cost opportunity to race in a single-make racing championship, over seven race weekends supporting the [[British GT]] package. For 2014, the series will once again return to Spa for an international round alongside the Swedish Ginetta Challenge series.\n\nA popular entry-level championship for many GT racers, the series boasts packed grids with close racing. All weekends are triple headers, providing 21 races throughout the season, with all races counting towards the final championship positions.\n\n===Prototype===\n[[File:GinettaG60LTP1lemans2018.jpg|thumb|[[Ginetta G60-LT-P1]]]]\n\nGinetta supplies customer [[LMP3]] cars for the [[European Le Mans Series]] and [[Asian Le Mans Series]] as well as the [[IMSA Prototype Challenge]]. \n\nIn 2017 Ginetta developed a [[LMP1]] class car the [[Ginetta G60-LT-P1]].<ref>http://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/ginetta-announces-lmp1-chassis-for-2018/</ref> \nFor the 2018\u201319 FIA World Endurance Championship season Ginetta entered 2 G60-LT-P1 in the WEC series in conjunction with TRSM Racing Manor. \nAt the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans, the #5 car finished 5th in class, while the #6 car retired after 10 hours due to persistent electrical issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motorsport.com/wec/news/manor-ginetta-solid-building-block-1054780/|title= Ginetta LMP1 a solid building block for ManorDriver line up|publisher= Motorsports.com |date=2 July 2018 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> \n\n{{-}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book | author=Walklett, Bob | title=Ginetta - The Inside Story: 31 Years of British Specialist Car Manufacturer | publisher=Bookmarque Publishing | year=1994 | isbn=1-870519-28-0}}\n*{{cite book | author=Rose, John | title=Ginetta: The Illustrated History   | publisher=G T Foulis & Co Ltd | year=1988 | isbn=0-85429-685-9}}\n*{{cite book | author=Pyman, T | title=History of the Ginetta G4   | publisher=Bookmarque Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-870519-69-8}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ginetta vehicles}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104151925/http://www.ginettacars.com/ Official '''Ginetta Cars''' website]\n* [http://www.ginetta.org Ginetta Owners Club]\n* [http://www.ginetta.com Ginetta Racing Site]\n* [http://en.ginetta-club.com/ Ginetta Club] {{in lang|en}}\n\n{{Ginetta Cars |state=collapsed}}\n{{Automotive industry in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Ginetta seasons}}\n\n[[Category:Ginetta vehicles| ]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Leeds]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1958]]\n[[Category:1958 establishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "Mr.choppers", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:Ginetta G28.jpg\u2192File:1988 Ginetta G30 (front left).jpga G30; the G28 is a notchback", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginetta_Cars"}
