Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained alongside voice actor [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed with a starring role in the television movie ''[[Marian Rose White]]'' (1982) and her first feature film, ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983).\n\nAfter continuing to search for acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role in [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]] that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart\u2014Lisa's brother\u2014to be more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called ''The Simpsons''. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.\n\nBesides ''The Simpsons'', Cartwright has also voiced numerous other animated characters, including Daffney Gillfin in ''[[The Snorks]]'', [[List of Kim Possible characters#Rufus|Rufus]] in ''[[Kim Possible]]'', [[Buttons and Mindy|Mindy]] in ''[[Animaniacs]]'', Pistol in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', Margo Sherman in ''[[The Critic]]'', Todd Daring in ''[[The Replacements (TV series)|The Replacements]]'', and Charles \"Chuckie\" Finster, Jr. in ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' (a role she assumed in 2002, following the retirement of [[Christine Cavanaugh]]). In 2000, she published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', and four years later, adapted it into a [[one-person show|one-woman play]].

long-running role as [[Bart Simpson]] on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Cartwright moved to Hollywood in 1978 and trained alongside voice actor [[Daws Butler]]. Her first professional role was voicing Gloria in the animated series ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'', which she followed with a starring role in the television movie ''[[Marian Rose White]]'' (1982) and her first feature film, ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983).\n\nAfter continuing to search for acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role in [[The Simpsons shorts|a series of animated shorts]] about a [[dysfunctional family]] that was to appear on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of [[Lisa Simpson]], the middle child; when she arrived at the audition, she found the role of Bart\u2014Lisa's brother\u2014to be more interesting. [[Matt Groening]], the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called ''The Simpsons''. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.\n\nBesides ''The Simpsons'', Cartwright has also voiced numerous other animated characters, including Daffney Gillfin in ''[[The Snorks]]'', [[List of Kim Possible characters#Rufus|Rufus]] in ''[[Kim Possible]]'', [[Buttons and Mindy|Mindy]] in ''[[Animaniacs]]'', Pistol in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', Margo Sherman in ''[[The Critic]]'', Todd Daring in ''[[The Replacements (TV series)|The Replacements]]'', and Charles \"Chuckie\" Finster, Jr. in ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' (a role she assumed in 2002, following the retirement of [[Christine Cavanaugh]]). In 2000, she published her autobiography, ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', and four years later, adapted it into a [[one-person show|one-woman play]]. In 2017, she wrote and produced the film ''[[In Search of Fellini]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nCartwright was born in Dayton, Ohio,<ref name=\"Little\" /> on October 25, 1957, Frank and Miriam Cartwright's fourth of six children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nancycartwright.com/html/about/bio.html |title=Biography highlights |publisher=Nancycartwright.com |access-date=February 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511223935/http://www.nancycartwright.com/html/about/bio.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}</ref> She grew up in [[Kettering, Ohio]],<ref name=Cincinatti /> and discovered her talent for voices at an early age.

Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\">Hedetoft, Ulf. \"Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation.\" ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua Franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources.

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past.

During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer.

Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of [[propaganda]]. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as [[Tokyo Rose]].

Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\">Hedetoft, Ulf. \"Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation.\" ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/> After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\n==Internet==\n\n===Impact on political media===\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media.

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past.

The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.<ref name=\"chomsky2\">{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

It began on 15 April 2011 and ended on 5 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summary - Virsliga 2011 - Latvia|url=https://int.soccerway.com/national/latvia/virsliga/2011/regular-season/|publisher=Soccerway|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe competition was won by [[FK Ventspils]], who thus qualified for the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]]. Runners-up [[FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs|Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs]] and third-placed sides [[FC Daugava|Daugava Daugavpils]] earned spots for the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League]]. On the bottom end of the table, [[JFK Olimps/RFS]] were relegated after losing their play-off series against [[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|Spartaks J\u016brmala]].\n\nAll nine clubs played every other club four times during the course of the season: twice at home and twice away. In addition, there will be no direct relegation to the [[Latvian First League]] this year.<ref name=ClubMeeting>{{cite web|title=Virsl\u012bgas \u010dempion\u0101ta klubu un LFF san\u0101ksmes l\u0113mumi|url=http://www.lff.lv/lv/news/2011/jan/84/|publisher=[[Latvian Football Federation]]|accessdate=17 February 2011|language=Latvian}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n[[FK Jaun\u012bba R\u012bga|Jaun\u012bba R\u012bga]] finished [[2010 Latvian Higher League|the previous year]]'s competition in tenth place and were relegated to the Latvian First League. This ended a one-year stay in the top flight. Promoted to the Higher League from the First Division automatically were the previous season's First Division champions, [[FB Gulbene 2005|Gulbene 2005]], who are taking part in the top flight for the first time in their history in 2011.\n\n[[FC Tranzit]] finished 9th in the 2010 Higher League competition and were supposed to compete in a promotion/relegation playoff against the runners-up of the First Division, [[FC J\u016brmala]]. However, before this playoff took place, Tranzit informed the [[Latvian Football Federation]] that they were forfeiting their place in the Higher League altogether, ending a two-year stay in the top flight.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Therefore, FC J\u016brmala were promoted to the Higher League automatically. Like Gulbene, they are competing in the top flight for the first time in their history in 2011.\n\nFinally, [[SK Bl\u0101zma]] decided to withdraw from the league during the off-season. This ended a three-year stay in the top flight.
