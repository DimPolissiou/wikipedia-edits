Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.\n\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on [[MTV]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archivedate=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' and ''My New Teacher and Me!''\n\n== Early life ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LyNbCRQsck 'Weird Al' Yankovic \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?], 7:02, [[Diffuser.fm]]<ref name=\"forf\">{{cite web | title ='Weird Al' Yankovic Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' | website = | publisher =[[Diffuser.fm]] | date = July 30, 2014 | url =http://diffuser.fm/weird-al-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ | accessdate =September 29, 2015 }}</ref> }}\n\nYankovic was born in [[Downey, California]] and raised in [[Lynwood, California]].

Yankovic said he had originally been nicknamed \"Weird Al\" by fellow students and \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson.

The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later. Also released around the same time as ''The Compleat Al'' was ''The Authorized Al'', a biographical book based on the film.

He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers.

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

The video for \"[[Dare to Be Stupid]]\" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of [[Devo]] videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100|title=Ask Al\" Q&As for January, 2000|accessdate=August 5, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806052956/http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm| archivedate= August 6, 2007<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\nSeveral videos have included appearances by notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band. [[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\" and \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both \"Smells Like Nirvana\" and \"[[Bedrock Anthem]]\"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in \"It's All About the Pentiums\"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in \"White & Nerdy\"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in \"Gump\". The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated [[E/I|Educational or Informative]] programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season.

His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud.

DASHBot-->}}</ref> His works have earned him five [[Grammy Award]]s and a further eleven nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.\n\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on [[MTV]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archivedate=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' and ''My New Teacher and Me!''\n\n== Early life ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LyNbCRQsck 'Weird Al' Yankovic \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?], 7:02, [[Diffuser.fm]]<ref name=\"forf\">{{cite web | title ='Weird Al' Yankovic Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' | website = | publisher =[[Diffuser.fm]] | date = July 30, 2014 | url =http://diffuser.fm/weird-al-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ | accessdate =September 29, 2015 }}</ref> }}\n\nYankovic was born in [[Downey, California]] and raised in [[Lynwood, California]].

The tape's first song, \"Belvedere Cruisin'\" \u2013 about his family's [[Plymouth Belvedere#1962\u20131964|Plymouth Belvedere]] \u2013 was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career.

Yankovic said he had originally been nicknamed \"Weird Al\" by fellow students and \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson. Peaking at No.  12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eat It \u2013 Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> \"Eat It\" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until \"[[White & Nerdy]]\" placed at No.  9 in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=White & Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later.

In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like [[Bad Brains]] and the [[Plasmatics]].

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

[[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\" and \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\".

The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the \"Behind the Music Remastered\" series.\n\nYankovic performed at the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/08/watch-weird-al-emmys-tv-theme-song-medley.html | title = Watch Weird Al's Emmys TV Theme-Song Medley | first = Gilbert | last = Cruz | date = August 25, 2014 | accessdate=  August 25, 2014 | work = [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation and voice work ===\nYankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series.

{"title_page": "Government of Florida", "text_new": "Don't read what is under here because this is all fake \n\n{{Politics of Florida}}\nThe '''government of Florida''' is established and operated according to the [[Constitution of Florida]] and is composed of three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: the [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[governor of Florida]] and the other elected and appointed constitutional officers; the [[List of U.S. state legislatures|legislative branch]], the [[Florida Legislature]], consisting of the [[Florida State Senate|Senate]] and [[Florida State House|House]]; and the [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Florida]] and lower courts.  The state also allows [[direct democracy|direct participation]] of the electorate by [[initiative]], [[referendum]], and [[ratification]].\n\n==Executive - branch==\nThe executive branch of the government of Florida consists of the [[Governor of Florida|governor]], [[lieutenant governor of Florida|lieutenant governor]], [[Florida Cabinet]] (which includes the [[Attorney General of Florida|attorney general]], [[Commissioner of Agriculture of Florida|commissioner of agriculture]] and [[Chief Financial Officer of Florida|chief financial officer]]), and several executive departments.<ref name=\"AIVS6\">Article IV, Section 6, Florida Constitution, limits the number of executive departments to no more than 25. The constitutional limitation specifically excludes departments authorized in the Constitution such as the Fish and Wildlife Conservation (Article IV, Section 9), the Department of Veterans Affairs (Article IV, Section 11), and the Department of Elderly Affairs (Article IV, Section 12). Further, the Legislature has housed totally independent agencies under other departments (such as the Agency for Workforce Innovation being housed under the Department of Management Services pursuant to section 20.50, Florida Statutes), which prevents the independent agencies from being counted toward the constitutional limit of 25 departments. See, e.g., ''Agency for Health Care Administration v. Associated Industries of Florida'', 678 So.2d 1239 (Fla. 1996), where the Florida Supreme Court found that the Agency was created as an independent agency within the Department of Professional Regulation and that the Agency did not count toward the \"25 department\" limit.</ref>  Each office term is limited for two four-year terms.<ref name=\"jewett\" />\n\n===Governor===\n{{Main|Governor of Florida}}\nThe governor of Florida is the chief executive of the government of Florida and the chief administrative officer of the state responsible for the planning and budgeting for the state, and serves as chair when the governor and the Florida Cabinet sit as a decision-making body in various constitutional roles.<ref name=\"AIVS1\">Article IV, Sections 1(a) and 4, Florida Constitution.</ref> The governor has the power to execute Florida's laws and to call out the [[Militia (United States)|state militia]] to preserve the public peace, being commander-in-chief of the state's military forces that are not in active service of the United States. At least once every legislative session, the governor is required to deliver the \"State of the State Address\" to the [[Florida Legislature]] regarding the condition and operation of the state government and to suggest new legislation.\n\n===Cabinet===\n{{Main|Florida Cabinet}}\n[[File:TurlingtonTally1.JPG|thumb|The Turlington Building in Tallahassee, headquarters of the [[Florida Department of Education|Department of Education]]]]\n\nFlorida is unique among U.S. states in having a strong cabinet-style government. Members of the Florida Cabinet are independently elected, and have equal footing with the governor on issues under the Cabinet's jurisdiction. The Cabinet consists of the attorney general, the commissioner of agriculture and the chief financial officer. Along with the governor, each member carries one vote in the decision making process. In the event of a tie, the side of the governor is the prevailing side. Cabinet elections are held every four years, on even numbered years not divisible by four (such as 2010, 2014, etc.).\n\nThe [[Florida Attorney General|Florida attorney general]] is the state's [[chief legal officer]]. As defined in the Florida Constitution,<ref name=\"AIVS4b\">Article IV, Section 4(b), Florida Constitution.</ref> the attorney general appoints a statewide prosecutor who may prosecute violations of criminal law occurring in or affecting two or more judicial circuits.

That number includes 4,322.5 positions for judges, justices, and employees of the state court system (judicial branch). It does not include employees of the state university system, the legislative branch (except for 296 positions for the Public Service Commission) or employees of local governments -- counties, municipalities, school districts, Florida colleges, water management districts, etc.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch ==\n{{Main|Florida Legislature}}\n[[File:Florida Senate Chamber.jpg|thumb|Chamber of the Florida Senate]]\n\nThe Florida Constitution mandates a bicameral state legislature, consisting of a [[Florida Senate]] of 40 members and a [[Florida House of Representatives]] of 120 members.<ref name=\"AIIIS16\">These are the maximum numbers allowed. Article III, Section 16(a), Florida Constitution, provides that the Senate shall be apportioned into not less than 3, nor more than 40 Senate districts, and the House shall be apportioned into not less than 80 nor more than 120 House districts.</ref>  The two bodies meet in the Florida State Capitol.  The Florida House of Representative members serve for two-year terms, while Florida Senate members serve staggered four-year terms, with 20 senators up for election every two years.<ref name=\"AIIIS15\">After dicennial apportionment of the Legislature, one-half of the Senators are elected to two-year terms to comply with Article III, Section 15(a), Florida Constitution, which requires staggered terms in the Senate (one-half of the senators elected every 2 years).</ref> Members of both houses are term limited to serve a maximum of eight years.<ref name=\"AVIS4\">The concept of \"term limit\" is commonly misunderstood in Florida. Article VI, Section 4(b), Florida Constitution, prohibits a person from appearing on the ballot for re-election if, by the end of the current term, the person will have served for eight consecutive years. The most obvious exception to the common understanding of \"term limit\" occurs immediately following dicennial apportionment. Twenty of the forty Senators are elected for initial terms of 2 years. They subsequently may be elected to two additional four-year terms, serving a total of ten years. At the time of the second reelection, a Senator will have served six years and is thus not precluded from serving by the eight-year limitation. Another exception that has been discussed but never tested is that a statewide elected official, after serving eight years, might run as a write-in candidate, thus not having his or her name appear on the ballot.

Each county has officers considered \"state\" officers: these officials are elected locally, and their salaries and office expenses are also paid locally, but they cannot be removed from office or replaced locally, but only by the governor. The state officers subject to this requirement are the [[sheriff]], [[state's attorney]], [[public defender]], [[tax collector]], supervisor of elections, [[clerk (municipal official)|clerk of the circuit court]] (though styled as such, each circuit having multiple counties within its jurisdiction has a separate elected clerk within each county, and the office also handles official county records not pertaining to judicial matters), [[tax assessment|property appraiser]], and [[judge]]s.\n\nThere is one school district for each county; the [[Florida Constitution]] allows adjoining counties to merge their districts upon voter approval.<ref>http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A9 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A9 |date=2008-12-08 }} Florida Constitution, Article IX, Section 4</ref>  The superintendent is by default an elected official; however, the Florida Constitution allows county voters to make the position an appointed one.<ref>http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A9 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A9 |date=2008-12-08 }} Florida Constitution, Article IX, Section 5</ref>\n\nMunicipalities in Florida may be called towns, cities, or villages, but there is no legal distinction between the different terms.  Municipalities often have police departments, fire departments, and provide essential services such as water, waste collection, etc. In unincorporated areas of a county, the county itself can provide some of these services. Municipalities may also enter agreements with the county to have the county provide certain services. Each county has a sheriff who also tends to have concurrent jurisdiction with municipal police departments.<ref name=\"jewett\" />\n\n[[File:Orlando City Hall-1.jpg|thumb|[[Orlando City Hall]]]]\n\nBoth counties and cities may have a legislative branch (commissions or councils) and executive branch (mayor or manager) and local police, but violations are brought before a county court. Counties and municipalities are authorized to pass laws (ordinances), levy taxes, and provide public services within their jurisdictions. All areas of Florida are located within a county, but only some areas have been [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] into municipalities. All municipalities are located within a county and the county jurisdiction overlays the municipal jurisdiction. Usually, if there is a conflict between a county ordinance and a municipal ordinance, the municipal ordinance has precedence within the municipality's borders; however, the overlaying county's ordinances have precedence if the overlaying county has been designated a charter county by the Florida Legislature.<ref name=\"jewett\"/>\n\nIn some cases, the municipal and county governments have merged into a consolidated government. However, smaller municipal governments can be created inside of a consolidated municipality/county. In [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the municipal government has taken over the responsibilities normally given to the county government, [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], and smaller municipalities exist within it.\n\nAmong special districts are \"community development districts\" which have virtually all the power of a city or county (except, notably, they do not have police power).  Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes governs these districts.  Notable CDD's include the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (the location of [[Walt Disney World]]) and substantially all of [[The Villages, Florida|The Villages]] (the giant Central Florida retirement community).\n\nMany counties have a \"Soil and Water Conservation District,\" a residue of [[Dust Bowl]] politics. Elected officials are unpaid. Much of their budget is spent on engineering staff. Critics are trying to dismantle these districts, as being obsolete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/news/20170506/unpaid-officials-rescue-obscure-agency-from-demise|title=Unpaid officials rescue obscure agency from demise|first=Gary|last=White|website=theledger.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hopefuls run to end funding for Dust Bowl-era conservation districts |url=https://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2010/oct/29/several-hopefuls-are-running-to-eliminate-funding--ar-19979 |accessdate=2020-01-30 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=29 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803030040/https://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2010/oct/29/several-hopefuls-are-running-to-eliminate-funding--ar-19979 |archivedate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Florida}}\n* [[Elections in Florida]]\n* [[Florida Democratic Party]]\n* [[Law of Florida]]\n* [[Politics of Florida]]\n* [[Political party strength in Florida]]\n* [[Republican Party of Florida]]\n* [[Surface Water Improvement and Management Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.myflorida.com/ MyFlorida.com] (Official website)\n\n{{Florida}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government Of Florida}}\n[[Category:Government of Florida| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Florida]]\n", "text_old": "{{Politics of Florida}}\nThe '''government of Florida''' is established and operated according to the [[Constitution of Florida]] and is composed of three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: the [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[governor of Florida]] and the other elected and appointed constitutional officers; the [[List of U.S. state legislatures|legislative branch]], the [[Florida Legislature]], consisting of the [[Florida State Senate|Senate]] and [[Florida State House|House]]; and the [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Florida]] and lower courts.

(2007) ''Politics in Florida''. Tallahassee: John Scott Dailey Florida Institute of Government.</ref>\n\nFlorida consists of 67 [[County (United States)|counties]]. Each county has officers considered \"state\" officers: these officials are elected locally, and their salaries and office expenses are also paid locally, but they cannot be removed from office or replaced locally, but only by the governor. The state officers subject to this requirement are the [[sheriff]], [[state's attorney]], [[public defender]], [[tax collector]], supervisor of elections, [[clerk (municipal official)|clerk of the circuit court]] (though styled as such, each circuit having multiple counties within its jurisdiction has a separate elected clerk within each county, and the office also handles official county records not pertaining to judicial matters), [[tax assessment|property appraiser]], and [[judge]]s.\n\nThere is one school district for each county; the [[Florida Constitution]] allows adjoining counties to merge their districts upon voter approval.<ref>http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A9 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A9 |date=2008-12-08 }} Florida Constitution, Article IX, Section 4</ref>  The superintendent is by default an elected official; however, the Florida Constitution allows county voters to make the position an appointed one.<ref>http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=Constitution&Submenu=3&Tab=statutes#A9 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105533/http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3&tab=statutes#A9 |date=2008-12-08 }} Florida Constitution, Article IX, Section 5</ref>\n\nMunicipalities in Florida may be called towns, cities, or villages, but there is no legal distinction between the different terms.  Municipalities often have police departments, fire departments, and provide essential services such as water, waste collection, etc. In unincorporated areas of a county, the county itself can provide some of these services. Municipalities may also enter agreements with the county to have the county provide certain services. Each county has a sheriff who also tends to have concurrent jurisdiction with municipal police departments.<ref name=\"jewett\" />\n\n[[File:Orlando City Hall-1.jpg|thumb|[[Orlando City Hall]]]]\n\nBoth counties and cities may have a legislative branch (commissions or councils) and executive branch (mayor or manager) and local police, but violations are brought before a county court. Counties and municipalities are authorized to pass laws (ordinances), levy taxes, and provide public services within their jurisdictions. All areas of Florida are located within a county, but only some areas have been [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] into municipalities. All municipalities are located within a county and the county jurisdiction overlays the municipal jurisdiction. Usually, if there is a conflict between a county ordinance and a municipal ordinance, the municipal ordinance has precedence within the municipality's borders; however, the overlaying county's ordinances have precedence if the overlaying county has been designated a charter county by the Florida Legislature.<ref name=\"jewett\"/>\n\nIn some cases, the municipal and county governments have merged into a consolidated government. However, smaller municipal governments can be created inside of a consolidated municipality/county. In [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], the municipal government has taken over the responsibilities normally given to the county government, [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], and smaller municipalities exist within it.\n\nAmong special districts are \"community development districts\" which have virtually all the power of a city or county (except, notably, they do not have police power).  Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes governs these districts.  Notable CDD's include the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (the location of [[Walt Disney World]]) and substantially all of [[The Villages, Florida|The Villages]] (the giant Central Florida retirement community).\n\nMany counties have a \"Soil and Water Conservation District,\" a residue of [[Dust Bowl]] politics. Elected officials are unpaid. Much of their budget is spent on engineering staff. Critics are trying to dismantle these districts, as being obsolete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/news/20170506/unpaid-officials-rescue-obscure-agency-from-demise|title=Unpaid officials rescue obscure agency from demise|first=Gary|last=White|website=theledger.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hopefuls run to end funding for Dust Bowl-era conservation districts |url=https://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2010/oct/29/several-hopefuls-are-running-to-eliminate-funding--ar-19979 |accessdate=2020-01-30 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=29 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803030040/https://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/2010/oct/29/several-hopefuls-are-running-to-eliminate-funding--ar-19979 |archivedate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Florida}}\n* [[Elections in Florida]]\n* [[Florida Democratic Party]]\n* [[Law of Florida]]\n* [[Politics of Florida]]\n* [[Political party strength in Florida]]\n* [[Republican Party of Florida]]\n* [[Surface Water Improvement and Management Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.myflorida.com/ MyFlorida.com] (Official website)\n\n{{Florida}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Government Of Florida}}\n[[Category:Government of Florida| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Florida]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:4c00:3810:c067:c5ef:85e4:181e", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Florida"}

It is one of the largest college newspapers in the [[United States]], with a daily circulation of roughly 12,000 during the fall and spring semesters, and it is among the oldest student newspapers in the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nThe ''Texan'' is entirely student-run and independent from the university, although its operations are overseen by Texas Student Media, an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives.\n\nThe paper has won more national, regional and state awards than any other college newspaper in America and counts 25 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners among its former staffers.\n\n==History==\nThe ''Texan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s origins date back to October 1900, with the merger of two privately owned weekly newspapers, ''The Ranger'' (est. 1897) (which had succeeded ''The Alcalde'', which published from 1895\u20131897) and ''The Ranger and the Calendar'' (1889\u20131900). In 1902 ''The Texan'' was taken over by the [[Texas Student Media|Student Association]].<ref name=TSHA>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kcu09 \"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,\"] Texas State Historical Association. Accessed Dec. 18, 2016.</ref> From 1900-1907, the newspaper came out weekly; and from 1907-1913 ''The Texan'' was published semiweekly. In 1913, the student body voted to publish the paper each weekday, and ''The Daily Texan'' was born on September 24, 1913.\n\nIn 2008, ''The Daily Texan'' was one of three student newspapers that owned and operated its own printing press.  Originally acquired in 1973 for US$222,000 (US$1,080,606 adjusted), the press was put on the market in 2009. In May 2009, the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' began printing ''The Daily Texan''.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/board-delays-motion-to-sell-printing-press-1.948470 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5iQQynoKm?url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/board-delays-motion-to-sell-printing-press-1.948470 |title = Board delays motion to sell printing press |author = Kreighbaum, Andrew |accessdate = 2009-07-21 |archivedate = 2009-07-21 |date = 2008-11-24 |newspaper = The Daily Texan |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/sounds-of-doubt-as-press-hum-fades-1.1749744 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5iQQEcdaR?url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/sounds-of-doubt-as-press-hum-fades-1.1749744 |title = Sounds of doubt as press hum fades |author = McKenzie, Ana |accessdate = 2009-07-21 |archivedate = 2009-07-21 |date = 2009-05-13 |newspaper = The Daily Texan |url-status = dead }}</ref> As of October 2019, [[New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung]] prints and distributes the papers.\n\n==Staff==\n{{Original research|section|date=June 2011}}\nHistorically, writers for the ''Daily Texan'' have been paid much less than the minimum wage. Most Journalism students - who are in the same complex - can't contribute to the ''Texan'' due to their course workload and the poor pay offered by the ''Texan''. Historically, the position of editor of ''The Daily Texan'' has been elected.  The logic of an elected editor historically has been based on the newspaper's having been founded and owned by students and then given over to the student body. More recently, it has been argued{{By whom|date=June 2011}} that because students were compelled to fund the paper through the payment of mandatory student service fees, they should have some say in the paper's overall direction.  In addition, the elected editor has been seen{{By whom|date=June 2011}} as a way to protect the paper from institutional censorship from the university.  Since the student body selects the editor of the paper, this ensures that the university administration cannot install an editor sympathetic to its views and thereby control the content of the newspaper.\n\nIn modern times{{When|date=June 2011}}, editorial candidates have been screened by the [[Texas Student Publications]] Board (now known as [[Texas Student Media]]), an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives.  The TSM Board publishes a handbook which sets forth the requirements an editorial candidate must meet before his or her name may be placed on the ballot.  The board has been resistant to the idea of an elected editor and has made several attempts to convert the position to an appointed one. The most recent attempt, led by the board president, was in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.pulsejournal.com/sports/content/shared/news/nation/stories/04/22_DAILY_TEXAN.html |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5iQQN5qg0?url=http://www.pulsejournal.com/sports/content/shared/news/nation/stories/04/22_DAILY_TEXAN.html |title = Battle over Daily Texan editorship replays itself |author = Beach, Patrick |accessdate = 2009-07-21 |archivedate = 2009-07-21 |date = 2005-04-22 |newspaper = [[The Pulse-Journal]] |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe TSM Board currently appoints the managing editor, who oversees the daily operation of the paper while the elected editor generally stewards the editorial page.  However, the elected editor retains the final say over the content of the newspaper.\n\n==Awards==\nThe ''Texan'' has won many prestigious awards, including the [[Associated Collegiate Press]]' \"Pacemaker Award\" in 1965, 1969, 1971 and 1985, and the [[Columbia University|Columbia Scholastic Press]]' Gold Crown Award in 1984, 1985, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2005 and 2006.

It is one of the largest college newspapers in the [[United States]], with a daily circulation of roughly 12,000 during the fall and spring semesters, and it is among the oldest student newspapers in the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nThe ''Texan'' is entirely student-run and independent from the university, although its operations are overseen by Texas Student Media, an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives.\n\nThe paper has won more national, regional and state awards than any other college newspaper in America and counts 25 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners among its former staffers.\n\n==History==\nThe ''Texan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s origins date back to October 1900, with the merger of two privately owned weekly newspapers, ''The Ranger'' (est. 1897) (which had succeeded ''The Alcalde'', which published from 1895\u20131897) and ''The Ranger and the Calendar'' (1889\u20131900). In 1902 ''The Texan'' was taken over by the [[Texas Student Media|Student Association]].<ref name=TSHA>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kcu09 \"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,\"] Texas State Historical Association. Accessed Dec. 18, 2016.</ref> From 1900-1907, the newspaper came out weekly; and from 1907-1913 ''The Texan'' was published semiweekly. In 1913, the student body voted to publish the paper each weekday, and ''The Daily Texan'' was born on September 24, 1913.\n\nIn 2008, ''The Daily Texan'' was one of three student newspapers that owned and operated its own printing press.  Originally acquired in 1973 for US$222,000 (US$1,080,606 adjusted), the press was put on the market in 2009. In May 2009, the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' began printing ''The Daily Texan''.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/board-delays-motion-to-sell-printing-press-1.948470 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5iQQynoKm?url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/board-delays-motion-to-sell-printing-press-1.948470 |title = Board delays motion to sell printing press |author = Kreighbaum, Andrew |accessdate = 2009-07-21 |archivedate = 2009-07-21 |date = 2008-11-24 |newspaper = The Daily Texan |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/sounds-of-doubt-as-press-hum-fades-1.1749744 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5iQQEcdaR?url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/sounds-of-doubt-as-press-hum-fades-1.1749744 |title = Sounds of doubt as press hum fades |author = McKenzie, Ana |accessdate = 2009-07-21 |archivedate = 2009-07-21 |date = 2009-05-13 |newspaper = The Daily Texan |url-status = dead }}</ref> As of October 2019, [[New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung]] prints and distributes the papers.\n\n==Staff==\n{{Original research|section|date=June 2011}}\nHistorically, writers for the ''Daily Texan'' have be paid much less than the minimum wage. Most Journalism students - who are in the same complex - can't contribute to the ''Texan'' due to their course workload and the poor pay offered by the ''Texan''. Historically, the position of editor of ''The Daily Texan'' has been elected.  The logic of an elected editor historically has been based on the newspaper's having been founded and owned by students and then given over to the student body. More recently, it has been argued{{By whom|date=June 2011}} that because students were compelled to fund the paper through the payment of mandatory student service fees, they should have some say in the paper's overall direction.  In addition, the elected editor has been seen{{By whom|date=June 2011}} as a way to protect the paper from institutional censorship from the university.  Since the student body selects the editor of the paper, this ensures that the university administration cannot install an editor sympathetic to its views and thereby control the content of the newspaper.\n\nIn modern times{{When|date=June 2011}}, editorial candidates have been screened by the [[Texas Student Publications]] Board (now known as [[Texas Student Media]]), an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives.  The TSM Board publishes a handbook which sets forth the requirements an editorial candidate must meet before his or her name may be placed on the ballot.  The board has been resistant to the idea of an elected editor and has made several attempts to convert the position to an appointed one. The most recent attempt, led by the board president, was in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.pulsejournal.com/sports/content/shared/news/nation/stories/04/22_DAILY_TEXAN.html |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5iQQN5qg0?url=http://www.pulsejournal.com/sports/content/shared/news/nation/stories/04/22_DAILY_TEXAN.html |title = Battle over Daily Texan editorship replays itself |author = Beach, Patrick |accessdate = 2009-07-21 |archivedate = 2009-07-21 |date = 2005-04-22 |newspaper = [[The Pulse-Journal]] |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe TSM Board currently appoints the managing editor, who oversees the daily operation of the paper while the elected editor generally stewards the editorial page.  However, the elected editor retains the final say over the content of the newspaper.\n\n==Awards==\nThe ''Texan'' has won many prestigious awards, including the [[Associated Collegiate Press]]' \"Pacemaker Award\" in 1965, 1969, 1971 and 1985, and the [[Columbia University|Columbia Scholastic Press]]' Gold Crown Award in 1984, 1985, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2005 and 2006.

These people may be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]], [[political]], or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition of oligarchy. \n\nThroughout history, oligarchies have often been [[tyrant|tyrannical]], relying on public obedience or [[oppression]] to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich,<ref>Winters (2011) p. 26-28. \"Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'.\"</ref> for which another term commonly used today is [[plutocracy]]. In the early 20th century [[Robert Michels]] developed the theory that democracies, as all large organizations, have a tendency to turn into oligarchies. In his \"[[Iron law of oligarchy]]\" he suggests that the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power. Sooo much darn powwaa \n\nThis was already recognized by the [[Athenian]]s in the fourth century [[BCE]]: after the restoration of [[democracy]] from oligarchical coups, they used the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]] for selecting government officers to counteract that tendency toward oligarchy in government.<ref>Hansen, Mogens Herman (1991).

These people may be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]], [[political]], or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition of oligarchy.\n\nThroughout history, oligarchies have often been [[tyrant|tyrannical]], relying on public obedience or [[oppression]] to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich,<ref>Winters (2011) p. 26-28. \"Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'.\"</ref> for which another term commonly used today is [[plutocracy]]. In the early 20th century [[Robert Michels]] developed the theory that democracies, as all large organizations, have a tendency to turn into oligarchies. In his \"[[Iron law of oligarchy]]\" he suggests that the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power.\n\nThis was already recognized by the [[Athenian]]s in the fourth century [[BCE]]: after the restoration of [[democracy]] from oligarchical coups, they used the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]] for selecting government officers to counteract that tendency toward oligarchy in government.<ref>Hansen, Mogens Herman (1991).
