Immediately following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] of December 7, 1941, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]]. This executive order was president Roosevelt\u2019s authorization to hand authority to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] and military commanders to designate areas to detain people living in the United States whom may be a threat to the country and its interests.

First appearing in the show's [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]], Clara served as a companion of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel in fiction|time traveller]] known as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in his [[Eleventh Doctor|eleventh]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and [[Twelfth Doctor|twelfth]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) incarnations. She remains the longest serving companion since the show's revival in 2005.\n\nClara is initially presented to the audience during the seventh series as three distinct, though similarly named, people living in different eras. The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. She continues to travel with the Doctor after the mystery is resolved at the end of the series, witnessing him regenerate into his twelfth incarnation in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). The pair have various adventures together in the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth]] and [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] until she departs the show in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015). She reappears briefly in the Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon A Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nOswin Oswald is introduced in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|series 7]] premiere, \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\" (2012). She is the sole survivor of the [[starship]] ''Alaska'', which crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane [[Dalek]]s. Oswin then learns from the [[Eleventh Doctor]] (Matt Smith) that she has been converted from human into a Dalek and has coped by retreating into a fantasy of her own intact survival. She assists the Doctor and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|travelling companions]], [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]), to escape the planet unharmed, but at the cost of her own life.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Asylum of the Daleks |episode-link=Asylum of the Daleks |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Nick (director) |last2=Hurran |author-link2=Nick Hurran |first3=Marcus (producer) |last3=Wilson |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=1 September 2012 |season= |series-no=7 |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Later, in the 2012 Christmas special \"[[The Snowmen]]\", the Doctor meets a woman named Clara Oswin Oswald, whom he initially knows only as Clara.

First appearing in the show's [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]], Clara served as a companion of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel in fiction|time traveller]] known as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in his [[Eleventh Doctor|eleventh]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and [[Twelfth Doctor|twelfth]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) incarnations. She remains the longest serving companion since the show's revival in 2005.\n\nClara is initially presented to the audience during the seventh series as three distinct, though similarly named, people living in different eras. The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. She continues to travel with the Doctor after the mystery is resolved at the end of the series, witnessing him regenerate into his twelfth incarnation in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). The pair have various adventures together in the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth]] and [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] until she departs the show in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015). She reappears briefly in the Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon A Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nOswin Oswald is introduced in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|series 7]] premiere, \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\" (2012). She is the sole survivor of the [[starship]] ''Alaska'', which crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane [[Dalek]]s. Oswin then learns from the [[Eleventh Doctor]] (Matt Smith) that she has been converted from human into a Dalek and has coped by retreating into a fantasy of her own intact survival. She assists the Doctor and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|travelling companions]], [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]), to escape the planet unharmed, but at the cost of her own life.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Asylum of the Daleks |episode-link=Asylum of the Daleks |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Nick (director) |last2=Hurran |author-link2=Nick Hurran |first3=Marcus (producer) |last3=Wilson |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=1 September 2012 |season= |series-no=7 |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Later, in the 2012 Christmas special \"[[The Snowmen]]\", the Doctor meets a woman named Clara Oswin Oswald, whom he initially knows only as Clara.

{"title_page": "List of Grand Ole Opry Members", "text_new": "The [[Grand Ole Opry]] is a weekly [[country music]] concert show in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which began as a radio barn dance on November 28, 1925, by [[George D. Hay]] and has since became one of the genre's most enduring and revered stages. Each show consists of multiple guest artists as well as Opry members, who are selected by Opry management based on several factors including critical and commercial success, respect for the history of country music and commitment to appearing on the program. Publicly, once a new member is chosen, an existing member will ask the new member to join the Opry live on-air during the broadcast, usually when the new member is performing as a guest. Being invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry is considered one of country music's crowning achievements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/grand-ole-opry/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924175135/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/grand-ole-opry/ |archivedate=2013-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nOpry members have permission to perform at any Opry show they wish, with each show typically consisting of between five and seven members. Each show is split into four \"segments\", each hosted by a different Opry member who entertains the crowd, performs and introduces other members and guest artists. As such, the Opry has featured a large, rotating ensemble of members ranging from all-time greats and [[Neotraditional country|neotraditionalists]] to [[Contemporary Country|contemporary stars]]. As the Opry is a running series, membership requires that the performer appear regularly (at least 12 shows per year, according to rules in place for most of the 21st century, down from 26 in the 1960s) on the program to remain a member of the show, and if a performer ceases performing regularly at the Opry or runs afoul of management, they can be stripped of their membership; if the exiled performer reconciles and renews their commitment to the show, they can be reinstated. Membership expires when the performer dies; if a single member of a duo or group retires or dies, the surviving member(s) may continue to maintain Opry membership on the group's behalf.  The Opry, in general, allows performers who retire, or are no longer physically able to perform on a regular basis to stay as members. The Grand Ole Opry House maintains a wall of fame backstage that contains a name plate for every person who has ever been a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThere are currently 68 Grand Ole Opry members.<ref>As of March 29, 2020, 68 is the current and corrected member count. Past counts were inaccurate. This includes the Opry Square Dancers and excludes Jan Howard and Joe Diffie, due to their recent deaths. Rhonda Vincent is to be the 69th current member once [[COVID-19]] restrictions are lifted.</ref> Nine of the sixty-eight no longer perform or have officially retired. Over the course of the program's history, over 200 acts have held Opry membership since the show's inception. As of 2020, [[Jesse McReynolds]] of [[Jim & Jesse]] is the oldest living Opry member and [[Kelsea Ballerini]] is the youngest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment|title=Entertainment|website=ABC News|accessdate=9 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{legend|#ccccff|Indicates active members}}\n{{legend|#ccffcc|Indicates former active members who have since reduced to guest artist status}}\n{{legend|#ffcccc|<sup>\u2021</sup> Indicates acts in which one of the members is deceased or retired, and the other(s) maintain active membership}}\n\nActs with a <sup>\u2020</sup> are deceased.\n\n==1920s==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Induction date\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Henry Bandy<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|1925\n|\n|-\n|2\n|[[Humphrey Bate]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|October 18, 1925\n|\n|-\n|3\n|[[Uncle Jimmy Thompson]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|November 28, 1925\n|\n|-\n|4\n|The McGee Brothers<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|1926\n|\n|-\n|5\n|[[Uncle Dave Macon]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|April 17, 1926\n|\n|-\n|6\n|The Pickard Family<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|May 8, 1926\n|\n|-\n|7\n| [[Deford Bailey]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|June 19, 1926\n|\n|-\n|8\n|The Crook Brothers<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 24, 1926\n|\n|-\n|9\n|[[Sid Harkreader]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 24, 1926\n|\n|-\n|10\n|[[Binkley Brothers' Dixie Clodhoppers]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|October 30, 1926\n|\n|-\n|11\n|[[Theron Hale]] and his Daughters<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|October 30, 1926\n|\n|-\n|12\n|[[Fiddlin' Arthur Smith|Arthur Smith]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 16, 1927\n|\n|-\n|13\n|The Fruit Jar Drinkers<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|December 17, 1927\n|\n|-\n|14\n|[[The Gully Jumpers]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|December 24, 1927\n|\n|-\n|15\n|Kitty Cora Cline<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|March 24, 1928\n|\n|-\n|16\n|Ed Poplin and his Barn Dance Orchestra<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|April 21, 1928\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Uncle Joe Mangrum and Fred Schriver<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 30, 1928\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Mazy Todd<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|\n|Mazy Todd (1881-1935) was the lead fiddler for Uncle Dave Macon.

Hay]] and has since became one of the genre's most enduring and revered stages. Each show consists of multiple guest artists as well as Opry members, who are selected by Opry management based on several factors including critical and commercial success, respect for the history of country music and commitment to appearing on the program. Publicly, once a new member is chosen, an existing member will ask the new member to join the Opry live on-air during the broadcast, usually when the new member is performing as a guest. Being invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry is considered one of country music's crowning achievements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/grand-ole-opry/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924175135/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/grand-ole-opry/ |archivedate=2013-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nOpry members have permission to perform at any Opry show they wish, with each show typically consisting of between five and seven members. Each show is split into four \"segments\", each hosted by a different Opry member who entertains the crowd, performs and introduces other members and guest artists. As such, the Opry has featured a large, rotating ensemble of members ranging from all-time greats and [[Neotraditional country|neotraditionalists]] to [[Contemporary Country|contemporary stars]]. As the Opry is a running series, membership requires that the performer appear regularly (at least 12 shows per year, according to rules in place for most of the 21st century, down from 26 in the 1960s) on the program to remain a member of the show, and if a performer ceases performing regularly at the Opry or runs afoul of management, they can be stripped of their membership; if the exiled performer reconciles and renews their commitment to the show, they can be reinstated. Membership expires when the performer dies; if a single member of a duo or group retires or dies, the surviving member(s) may continue to maintain Opry membership on the group's behalf.  The Opry, in general, allows performers who retire, or are no longer physically able to perform on a regular basis to stay as members. The Grand Ole Opry House maintains a wall of fame backstage that contains a name plate for every person who has ever been a member of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThere are currently 68 Grand Ole Opry members.<ref>As of March 29, 2020, 68 is the current and corrected member count. Past counts were inaccurate. This includes the Opry Square Dancers and excludes Jan Howard and Joe Diffie, due to their recent deaths. Rhonda Vincent is to be the 69th current member once [[COVID-19]] restrictions are lifted.</ref> Nine of the sixty-eight no longer perform or have officially retired. Over the course of the program's history, over 200 acts have held Opry membership since the show's inception. As of 2020, [[Jesse McReynolds]] of [[Jim & Jesse]] is the oldest living Opry member and [[Kelsea Ballerini]] is the youngest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment|title=Entertainment|website=ABC News|accessdate=9 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{legend|#ccccff|Indicates active members}}\n{{legend|#ccffcc|Indicates former active members who have since reduced to guest artist status}}\n{{legend|#ffcccc|<sup>\u2021</sup> Indicates acts in which one of the members is deceased or retired, and the other(s) maintain active membership}}\n\nActs with a <sup>\u2020</sup> are deceased.\n\n==1920s==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4em;\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Induction date\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Henry Bandy<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|1925\n|\n|-\n|2\n|[[Humphrey Bate]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|October 18, 1925\n|\n|-\n|3\n|[[Uncle Jimmy Thompson]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|November 28, 1925\n|\n|-\n|4\n|The McGee Brothers<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|1926\n|\n|-\n|5\n|[[Uncle Dave Macon]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|April 17, 1926\n|\n|-\n|6\n|The Pickard Family<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|May 8, 1926\n|\n|-\n|7\n| [[Deford Bailey]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|June 19, 1926\n|\n|-\n|8\n|The Crook Brothers<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 24, 1926\n|\n|-\n|9\n|[[Sid Harkreader]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 24, 1926\n|\n|-\n|10\n|[[Binkley Brothers' Dixie Clodhoppers]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|October 30, 1926\n|\n|-\n|11\n|[[Theron Hale]] and his Daughters<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|October 30, 1926\n|\n|-\n|12\n|[[Fiddlin' Arthur Smith|Arthur Smith]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 16, 1927\n|\n|-\n|13\n|The Fruit Jar Drinkers<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|December 17, 1927\n|\n|-\n|14\n|[[The Gully Jumpers]]<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|December 24, 1927\n|\n|-\n|15\n|Kitty Cora Cline<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|March 24, 1928\n|\n|-\n|16\n|Ed Poplin and his Barn Dance Orchestra<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|April 21, 1928\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Uncle Joe Mangrum and Fred Schriver<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|July 30, 1928\n|\n|-\n|18\n|Mazy Todd<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|\n|Mazy Todd (1881-1935) was the lead fiddler for Uncle Dave Macon.

The school serves an average of 300 students consisting of 80-90 pupils in each grade level.  High school classes average around 20-30 students, including grade levels 9 through 12. The school's mascot is the [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. The school's colors are [[Purple]] and [[Silver (color)|Silver]]\n\n==Background==\nMCHS allows high school students to take [[high school]] classes and [[college]] courses at the same time, also known as Dual Enrollment. It was only in the year 2003 that they had ninth graders participating in the program as part of the transition to the [[Early College]] model conceptualized by the Middle College National Consortium.\n\nMost students have the opportunity to earn [[Course credit|credit]] and to complete from a year to even an AA Degree or an Honors AA Degree worth of college classes. Most students take 3 to 11 college units a semester. Students have educational plans that structure their learning so that they can complete their AA requirements at [[Santa Ana College]], while completing their high school course work.\n\nCollege courses are free to all MCHS students because educational partners such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] offer grants to pay for the students' college tuition and textbooks. MCHS has a high school academic counselor and a full-time SAC academic counselor who help students plan their courses. The school is staff by 13 teachers who are responsible for teaching the core curricula and many electives; the students spend their day taking both college and high school classes along with participating in many extra-curricular activities\n\n==Athletics==\nMiddle College High School has sports such as volleyball, soccer, football and basketball. Middle college also offers college sports in which students must be 18 years or older to participate. Most universities only check the high school and college grades for the student's sophomore and junior year. In order to take college courses while at MCHS, student's parents have to sign the CAPP form, a [[permission slip]], saying that the parents agree to let the student take the course that was assigned.\nStudents take college PE classes to fulfill their physical education classes. Such classes include yoga, dance (from ballet to hip hop), circuit training, track, swimming, aerobics, soccer, etc.\n\n==Achievements==\nAlthough the school is still growing, it has many achievements that are noteworthy: Honorable Mention as a CA Distinguished High School; growth in its API score; and a 100% pass rate on the [[CAHSEE]] for the last 7 consecutive years. Most recently, U.S. News & World Report ranks Middle College High among the 'Best High Schools' in the Nation.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}} In 2008, based on its API score, Middle College High School was ranked the 5th best High School in Orange County, California. In 2009 and 2015 MCHS was awarded [[National Blue Ribbon School|A Blue Ribbon Award]] and was named A [[California Distinguished School]]. In 2010, MCHS's score on the Star Tests was 890 and their goal on (2011) was to reach 900. On October 11, 2012, the current principal announced their Star Test score to be 906, making MCHS one of the only 10 schools in Orange County, CA to receive a score greater than 900. In 2016, MCHS was awarded [[National Blue Ribbon School|A Blue Ribbon Award]] and was named A [[California Distinguished School]] once again.\n\n==Clubs==\nMCHS currently hosts the following clubs:[[Environmentally friendly|Eco]], [[Basketball Club]], [[One Note Club]], [[Robotics]], Book Club, Film Club, M.A.G.E Club, [[Yearbook]], The Spellbinder, Cheer Club, M.A.D.
