{"title_page": "Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain", "text_new": "The '''site of the [[Roman conquest of Britain#Landing to Thames battle|Claudian invasion of Britain]]''' in AD 43 is a matter of academic debate.

And while [[Rutupi\u00e6]] ([[Richborough]], on the east coast of [[Kent]]) is often stated as the site of the landing (e.g. by [[Sheppard Frere]]),<ref>[[Sheppard Frere]] (1967), ''Britannia: A History of Roman Britain'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, London</ref> there are equally plausible arguments in favour of a landing further west along the south coast of Britain.\n\nThe only contemporary detailed account of the invasion comes from [[Cassius Dio]]'s ''Roman History'',<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60:19-22]</ref> written in the early 3rd century.

The three divisions would have then advanced from the coast and met at the [[River Medway]].\n\nOther historians dispute that the Romans landed in Kent. Dio describes how the troops saw a [[meteoroid|shooting star]] whilst at sea and were cheered by this [[omen]]. He adds that it travelled from east to west and that this was the direction the Romans were sailing in. However, a voyage from Boulogne to Kent sails from south to north.\n\nTaking Boulogne as the point of departure, historians such as [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]]<ref>[[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] (1982), ''Londinium: London in the Roman Empire''</ref> and J. G. F. Hind<ref>J G F Hind (1989), The Invasion of Britain in AD 43, ''Britannia'', 20, 1-21</ref> have used Dio's account to suggest a landing point much further west along the south coast of Britain, around [[the Solent]] or [[Southampton Water]]. This is supported by Dio's stated reason for the Roman invasion, that [[Verica]], the king of the [[Atrebates]] who lived in the area of modern-day [[Hampshire]], had appealed for Roman assistance after he was expelled in a coup, and by [[Suetonius]]'s assertion that Vespasian conquered the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Vespasian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]</ref>\n\nSimilarly Dio writes of an early victory when the Romans received the surrender of a tribe he calls the \"Bodunni\". No tribe of this name is known, but it is very similar to that of the [[Dobunni]] who occupied [[Gloucestershire]]. In this case, a landing point in the region of [[Chichester]] or [[Portsmouth]] might be expected.\n\nThe remains of military storehouses dating to the appropriate period have been found under [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], a 1st-century [[Roman villa]] near Chichester and, on the basis of this, and other archaeological evidence, archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]], formerly a proponent of the Kent hypothesis, has stated that he was becoming persuaded by the arguments in favour of a South Coast landing.<ref>[[Barry Cunliffe]] (1998), ''Fishbourne Roman Palace'', Tempus, Stroud, p 21</ref>\n\nOther historians argue that, as the Roman invasion fleet may have numbered as many as 1,000 ships, mostly slow and ungainly troop transports, its commanders would have wanted to minimise the time spent at sea because of the risk of contrary winds, and that this favours the short route to Kent rather than the longer journey up the Channel to the Solent. Richborough had a large natural harbour (long since silted up) which would have provided a suitable anchorage for the landing (though its capacity to hold more than a small part of the fleet has been questioned),<ref>E W Black (2000), \"Sentius Saturninus and the Roman Invasion of Britain\", ''Britannia'', 31, 1-10</ref> and there are archaeological remains of earthworks, interpreted as defensive ditches, dug to protect the anchorage, dating to the period of the invasion. There is also evidence at Richborough of a ceremonial arch, which may have commemorated Richborough's role in the invasion, but as the arch was not constructed until c AD 80, by which time Rutupi\u00e6 was the major port of entry into Britain from the continent, its relation to the events of the invasion is uncertain.\n\nThe British defence was led by [[Caratacus]] and [[Togodumnus]] of the [[Catuvellauni]], an eastern kingdom with influence over Kent, and the Romans' immediate objective seems to have been to secure a crossing of the River [[Thames]] in order to reach the territory of the Catuvellauni. The Dobunni, who Dio says were tributaries of the Catuvellauni, could have sent troops eastwards to their aid, who then surrendered to Plautius in Kent. In this scenario, Vespasian's western conquests could have taken place after the Thames crossing was secured.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Claudius sailed from Boulogne,<ref>Suetonius, ''Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#17 17]</ref> and it is usually assumed that the  main force under Plautius sailed from the same place, but it is possible that Plautius's forces sailed from the mouth of the [[Rhine]], which [[Strabo]] names as a point of departure used for crossings to Britain in the early 1st century; ships commonly sailed along the coast of [[Gallia Belgica|Belgic Gaul]] to the territory of the [[Morini]], before taking a relatively short open-sea crossing to Britain.<ref>[[Strabo]], ''Geography'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html#5.2 4:5.2]</ref> This would account for the westward journey in Dio's account. On the other hand, if the Rhine was the point of departure, and if the Catuvellauni were Plautius's objective, it could be argued that a landing south of the Thames would have been unnecessary and have entailed as much risk as a landing north of the river.\n\nThe three divisions mentioned by Dio also leave open the possibility that, while the main landing was in Kent, part of the force sailed to the Solent to aid Verica, or vice versa.

Many episodes of this series take place in part of the Saturn system, designated as \"Saturn Federation.\" The spaceship carrying the main characters is the Trans-Utopian, which travels frequently between Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Various moons of Saturn are mentioned, including Titan and Iapetus. There is also a large space station orbiting Saturn at which the Trans-Utopian docks, called \"Ring-Shepherd.\"\n*In the novel ''[[The True Meaning of Smekday]]'', the Boov, after leaving Earth, colonize one of Saturn's moons. It is \"a bit of a fixer-upper\", though.\n*The Daedalus Series, by Michael J.

In the books, Saturn is referred to as Great Xanath.\n*Many levels of the video game ''[[Overload (video game)|Overload]]'' take place in facilities located on the moons of Saturn.\n\n== Janus ==\n[[Image:Janus 2006 closeup by Cassini.jpg|right|80px|Janus]]\n[[Janus (moon)|Janus]] is a small inner moon of Saturn notable for having an orbit nearly identical to the orbit of the moon [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]]; the two swap orbital positions every four years.\n\n*Janus features prominently in [[Alastair Reynolds]]' science fiction novel ''[[Pushing Ice]]'' (2005). In the novel, Janus is revealed to be a shell containing an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] spacecraft which unexpectedly departs the [[solar system]] in the direction of a giant structure orbiting the star [[Spica]]. The novel tells the story of the crew of a human mining ship who establish a colony on the moon as it leaves the [[solar system]].\n\n== Mimas ==\n[[Image:Mimas shape.jpg|right|80px]]\n[[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] is a small, [[icy moon]] orbiting close to Saturn, notable for being scarred by [[Herschel (Mimantean crater)|Herschel crater]], whose diameter is very wide compared to the total circumference of the moon.\n\n*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'' the hero, knowing that Mimas is almost entirely made of ice, guides his ship on a collision course towards it, melts its surface with his weapons, and thus hides the ship in order to escape from his enemies, the people from the Sirius System.\n*In \"Zero Summer,\" a short story by [[Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan]], Mimas is the destination of a starship manned by two androids.\n* Mimas is a recurring location in the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' TV sitcom and its spinoff novels. In the episode \"[[Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode)|Dimension Jump]]\", Mimas hosts a Space Corps test base for test pilot [[Red Dwarf characters#Ace Rimmer|Arnold J. 'Ace' Rimmer]], while the first novel, ''[[Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'', begins with [[Dave Lister]] stranded in a seedy city on Mimas. Both the book and the series refer to the local delicacy \"Mimean Bladderfish\".\n*\"[[The First Duty]]\" (1992), episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Mimas is the site of an evacuation station to which four [[Starfleet]] cadets, including [[Wesley Crusher]], transport after their vessels collide.\n*In [[Grant Callin]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Mimas is one of the locations of an alien artifact. It is also the site of human colonization and mining called \"M-Base\".\n*In the table-top science fiction game ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', Mimas serves as a high-security prison for the most dangerous prisoners of the Ordo Malleus branch of the Inquisition.\n*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Mimas is home to a notable \"Outer\" family which has profound influence over Jovian/Saturnian satellite politics.\n*In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story ''Les Mortes d'Arthur'' (1985), Herschel crater (named Arthur in the story) is the site of the terrestrial part of the sixty-sixth Olympic Winter Games (2194) and the setting of a murder mystery.\n*In Alexander Janzer's science fiction novel ''Higher Reality'' (2015), Mimas is where the protagonist encounters a strange extraterrestrial craft while investigating the disappearance of the crew of a small outpost.\n\n== Enceladus ==\n[[Image:Enceladusstripes cassini.jpg|right|80px|Enceladus]]\n[[Enceladus]] is a small, icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, with an extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region. It is the source of material for Saturn's E Ring.\n\n*In the 1930s [[Buck Rogers]] [[old time radio]] show, Enceladus makes an appearance. In the story entitled \"[[Killer Kane]] and Ardala on Saturn's moon,\" the titular villains try to take over the peaceful government of the Saturnian moon. The moon is depicted as having an atmosphere and supporting a happy population of [[humanoid]] life. Buck races to the moon to set things right.\n*In ''[[Exosquad]]'', Enceladus was the location of a heavily fortified Pirate Clans' outpost and the site of the second battle between them and the [[Exofleet]] just prior to the beginning of the Terran-Neosapien war.\n*In Grant D. Callin's science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Enceladus is one of the locations of an alien artifact.\n*At the conclusion of the [[Time Machine (book series)|Time Machine]] book ''The Rings of Saturn'' (set in 2085), the spacecraft blows up Enceladus as it returns to [[Earth]] after meeting an alien life-form.\n*In [[Charles R. Pellegrino|Charles Pellegrino's]] ''Dust'', the narrative switches periodically to a robotic probe landing on Enceladus in search of life.\n*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Enceladus serves as one of the battlefields as Earth invades Saturn's inhabited satellites in the 23rd Century.\n*The History Channel show ''[[Life After People: The Series]]'', depicts the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft crashing into it and causing the bacteria on the craft to begin to inhabit it, eventually evolving into [[extraterrestrial life]].\n*In the ''[[Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal]]'' web comic ([http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1733 #1733]), Enceladus is depicted as having fish like creatures below its icy surface. These creatures are used in what appears to be the McDonald's [[Filet-O-Fish|Fish Fillet]].\n*In the [[GURPS]] sourcebook ''GURPS Space: Terradyne'', the Terradyne corporation detonates a nuclear explosion on Enceladus to alter its orbit to eventually impact [[Mars]], as part of its Martian [[terraforming]] project.\n*In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Cold Warriors]]\", Enceladus is referred to as \"Saturn's main dump moon\", and is the location of a specimen of the cold virus from the 20th century.\n*The ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'' stops at Enceladus in the fourth episode of ''[[Space Battleship Yamato 2199]]'' to acquire a rare metal for essential repairs, and to find possible survivors transmitting a distress signal. Isolated ''Yamato'' crew members are pursued by enemy forces, but are saved by an ice geyser. The moon is later used as a base for the Earth Defense Fleet by 2202.\n*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', characters occasionally refer to the \"Enceladian biota\" &ndash; microscopic alien organisms that some humans ingest, believing them to have medicinal value.\n*Michael J. Martinez's novel ''The Enceladus Crisis'' is set in part on Enceladus.\n*In the video game [[Destiny 2: Forsaken]] Cayde-6 leaves a coded message in the mission \"Ace in the Hole\" that goes as follows: \"If The Sun Over Nessus Escapes Nebula Cycle; Evac Labor After Dawn, Under Solstice\". If you take the first letter from each word, it spells the sentence IT'S ON ENCELADUS.\n*In Evan Rentz's novel ''Neighbor Earth: The Landing in Illinois'' (2019), Enceladus is the origin of the Saturn beasts, an intelligent extraterrestrial species whose discovery was claimed by the United States during the height of the [[Space Race]].\n\n== Tethys ==\n[[Image:Odysseus crater.jpg|right|80px|Tethys]]\n[[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] is a medium-sized icy moon orbiting close to Saturn, very similar to Dione.\n\n* An unnamed Tethys is the setting for the 1980 science fiction thriller ''[[Saturn 3]]''.\n* In the American animated television series ''[[Exosquad]]'', Tethys was the primary base of the Pirate Clans prior to the discovery of Chaos.\n* In the 1993 computer game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', an image of Tethys was used for a fictional planet called Tei-Tenga, which was cut from the game. The image can be still seen within the games textures.\n* Level 17 of the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' takes place in the Tethys H<sub>2</sub>O Mine.\n*In Warhammer 40,000, Tethys is the location of the Librarium Daemonicum, a repositary of the knowledge of the Ordo Malleus branch of the Inquisition.\nDue to the large crater on the surface of Tethys, some people call it \"The Death Moon\" due to it being similar to the Star Wars battle station, the Death Star, a moon-sized spacestation with a superlaser powerful enough to blow up planets.\n\n== Dione ==\n[[Image:Dione color south.jpg|right|80px|Dione]]\n[[Dione (moon)|Dione]] is a medium-sized icy moon orbiting close to Saturn\n*In [[Grant Callin|Grant D. Callin's]] science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] is one of the locations of an alien artifact.\n*In the early [[Noon Universe]] novel ''[[Space Apprentice]]'' by [[Strugatsky brothers]] as the heroes stop there on their way (one of them is a planetologist and has some interest in the moon's observatory) they found that its administrator made it a living hell for everybody. This revelation serves as one of the major plot points in the novel.\n*In [[Paul J. McAuley]]'s ''[[The Quiet War (novel)|The Quiet War]]'' (2008), Dione's Paris is the leading settlement amongst Saturn's inhabited \"Outer\" satellite colonies, and suffers heavily due to its vocal resistance.\n*In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', Dione has been broken into chunks and crashed onto the surface of [[Venus]] as part of a [[terraforming]] process.\n\n== Rhea ==\n[[Image:Rhea true color.jpg|right|80px]]\n[[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] is the second-largest moon of Saturn.\n\n* \"Valley of Pretenders\" by Dennis Clive (pseudonym of [[John Russell Fearn]]), published in ''Science Fiction'', March 1939.\n* \"Outpost of the Eons\" by Dirk Wylie (pseudonym of Joseph Harold Dockweiler), published in ''Astonishing Stories'', April 1943.\n* In the film ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', humanity builds a defense outpost on Rhea.\n* In the [[Red Rising]] book series, 60 years prior to the events of the books Rhea rebelled against the society and as a lesson to other inhabited moons and planets was 'glassed' (the surface bombarded until so hot it formed a layer of glass-like rock).\n\n== Titan ==\n[[Image:Titan in natural color Cassini.jpg|80px|right|Titan]]\n{{main|Titan in fiction}}\n[[Titan (moon)|Titan]] is the largest [[natural satellite|moon]] of [[Saturn]]. Its substantial [[atmosphere]] makes it the most [[Earth]]-like moon in the [[Solar System]] and hence a popular [[science fiction]] setting.\n<!--Please put additional references to Titan in the *Titan in fiction* main article, not in this space-->\n\n== Hyperion ==\n[[Image:Hyperion true.jpg|right|80px]]\n[[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] is the largest irregularly-shaped moon of Saturn, orbiting between Titan and Iapetus.\n\n* Level 16 of the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'' takes place in a [[methane]] mine on Hyperion.\n* In [[Dan Simmons]]'s ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'', the eponymous planet was first colonised by settlers from a colony on the moon Hyperion.\n* In [[Alastair Reynolds]]' science fiction novel ''[[On the Steel Breeze]]'' (2012), Hyperion is home to a colony of \"artists and malcontents\".\n* In the anime ''[[Infinite Ryvius]]'' (1999), Hyperion is the site of a self-governed colony independent of the rest of the Alliance.\n\n== Iapetus ==\n\n[[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] is a large moon orbiting further from Saturn than any of its other large satellites.  Half of its surface is very bright while the other half is extremely dark.  Investigations since 2004 have also noted its irregular shape, immense impact basins, and a high mountainous ridge on the equator.\n\n* In [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story \"The Comedian's Children\" (1958), a manned expedition to Iapetus in 2034 creates a public craze for black/white designs and \"bi-colored gimcrackery\", but is later linked to ''iapetitis'', a disease in children where one side of the body turns white and paralyzed, the other black.\n* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), astronaut Dave Bowman finds an enigmatic alien monolith waiting for him on the surface of Iapetus (referred to as \"Japetus\" throughout). Iapetus's two tone coloration is caused by a vast white ellipse on the moon's surface, with the monolith appearing as a black dot in its exact center. When the ''Voyager'' space probes arrived at Iapetus thirteen years later, they discovered that there was indeed a black region within the moon's brighter hemisphere. Clarke reports that [[Carl Sagan]], who was on the ''Voyager'' imaging team, sent him a photo, with the note \"Thinking of you ...\".<ref>Arthur C. Clarke, Introduction to ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' (1984)</ref>  Because of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)#Differences from the film|difficulties]] achieving a convincing model of Saturn's rings, the film version of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' relocated the monolith to an orbit around Jupiter. The three sequel novels written by Clarke follow the film rather than the novel in this matter.\n* Iapetus is the setting for ''[[The Saturn Game]]'' (1981) by [[Poul Anderson]].\n* Iapetus is the second site of the mysterious phenomenon called \"goorm\" in Sergei Pavlov's hard SF novel ''[[Moon Rainbow]]'' (1984), first being the Uranus' moon [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].\n* In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s futuristic novel ''[[The Memory of Whiteness]]'' (1985), Iapetus is populated by the descendants of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] colonists who retain a [[Communist]] political system.\n* In [[Grant Callin]]'s 1986 science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Iapetus is one of the locations of an alien artifact. There is also human colonization and mining at an installation called \"I-Base\".\n* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s [[Gaea trilogy]], Iapetus is used as a \"nest\" for a fledgling Titan.  One of the objectives of the ''Ringmaster'' mission to Saturn is to investigate the moon's dark region recently contracting to a narrow band; Gaea reveals this is the result of her offspring entering a new stage of development.  When it is fully mature, Iapetus will be shattered and the new Titan born out of its rubble.\n* In [[David Weber]]'s novel ''[[The Armageddon Inheritance]]'' (1993), genocidal aliens (the Achuultani) attempt to use Iapetus as a kinetic energy weapon to destroy all life on Earth.\n* In the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' universe, Iapetus acts as a dockyard for the Ordo Malleus fleet, as well as that of the Grey Knights chapter of Space Marines.\n* Iapetus appears in [[Ian McDonald (author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''Chaga''.\n* In [[Jack McDevitt]]'s ''[[The Engines of God]]'' (1996), there is a strange ice-made icon on Iapetus. It leads to a depressing discovery that every intelligent civilization of the Galaxy could be obliterated by an unknown Dark Force from the void between the Galaxy's arms.\n* Iapetus is the setting of the book ''Aliens: Steel Egg'' by John Shirley (2007).\n* In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'', a giant city known as the High Street is built along the spine of Iapetus's [[equatorial ridge]].\n* In the online comic by Joshua Quagmire, ''Bunz & Katz'' (November 2012 - current) Iapetus is revealed to be an ancient, near-derelict alien battle station which is \"awakened\" by the ''Cassini'' probe fly-by. The series' protagonists are the only surviving scouts from this station.\n\n==Phoebe==\n\n[[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] is a retrograde orbiting moon in the outer Saturn system. It is the largest of the Saturnian [[irregular moon]]s.\n\n*In [[James S.A. Corey]]'s ''Expanse'' series, Phoebe is actually an alien biological warhead that was accidentally captured by Saturn on its way to reprogram protozoan life on Earth. The extraction and use as a weapon of the protomolecular payload of Phoebe drives the primary conflicts of the series. After the protomolecule is used against [[433 Eros]], Phoebe is destroyed via thermonuclear bombardment by the Martian space navy to keep anyone else from obtaining samples, and to prevent it from getting loose in the system.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Saturn}}\n{{Astronomical locations in fiction}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Saturn's moons in fiction| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of astronomical locations in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Saturn System Montage - GPN-2000-000439.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Saturn and its moons]]\nSeveral of [[Saturn]]'s [[moons of Saturn|natural satellites]] have figured prominently in works of [[science fiction]].\n\n== Saturnian system ==\nSome works of fiction refer to several of Saturn's moons, or to no specific moon.\n*''[[Animorphs]]'' novel series.

In the novel, Janus is revealed to be a shell containing an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] spacecraft which unexpectedly departs the [[solar system]] in the direction of a giant structure orbiting the star [[Spica]]. The novel tells the story of the crew of a human mining ship who establish a colony on the moon as it leaves the [[solar system]].\n\n== Mimas ==\n[[Image:Mimas shape.jpg|right|80px]]\n[[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] is a small, [[icy moon]] orbiting close to Saturn, notable for being scarred by [[Herschel (Mimantean crater)|Herschel crater]], whose diameter is very wide compared to the total circumference of the moon.\n\n*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn]]'' the hero, knowing that Mimas is almost entirely made of ice, guides his ship on a collision course towards it, melts its surface with his weapons, and thus hides the ship in order to escape from his enemies, the people from the Sirius System.\n*In \"Zero Summer,\" a short story by [[Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan]], Mimas is the destination of a starship manned by two androids.\n* Mimas is a recurring location in the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' TV sitcom and its spinoff novels. In the episode \"[[Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode)|Dimension Jump]]\", Mimas hosts a Space Corps test base for test pilot [[Red Dwarf characters#Ace Rimmer|Arnold J.

Both the book and the series refer to the local delicacy \"Mimean Bladderfish\".\n*\"[[The First Duty]]\" (1992), episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Mimas is the site of an evacuation station to which four [[Starfleet]] cadets, including [[Wesley Crusher]], transport after their vessels collide.\n*In [[Grant Callin]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Saturnalia (Callin novel)|Saturnalia]]'', Mimas is one of the locations of an alien artifact. It is also the site of human colonization and mining called \"M-Base\".\n*In the table-top science fiction game ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', Mimas serves as a high-security prison for the most dangerous prisoners of the Ordo Malleus branch of the Inquisition.\n*In [[Paul J.

It is the source of material for Saturn's E Ring.\n\n*In the 1930s [[Buck Rogers]] [[old time radio]] show, Enceladus makes an appearance. In the story entitled \"[[Killer Kane]] and Ardala on Saturn's moon,\" the titular villains try to take over the peaceful government of the Saturnian moon. The moon is depicted as having an atmosphere and supporting a happy population of [[humanoid]] life. Buck races to the moon to set things right.\n*In ''[[Exosquad]]'', Enceladus was the location of a heavily fortified Pirate Clans' outpost and the site of the second battle between them and the [[Exofleet]] just prior to the beginning of the Terran-Neosapien war.\n*In Grant D.

He organized and briefly directed the [[lazaretto|quarantine facility]] for [[cholera]]-stricken seafarers and immigrants on [[Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Island]], and then performed his [[medical residency]] in a number of European hospitals before earning his degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]] and returning to Argentina, in 1910.  He then met a fellow [[Italian Argentine]], Clorinda Br\u00edgida Razori, and they married in 1914\u2014creating a lasting professional partnership, as well as marriage.<ref name=chagas/>\n\nThe onset of [[World War I]] returned Mazza to [[Europe]], where he was commissioned in 1916 by the [[Argentine Army]] to study the crisis of infectious disease in the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s. There, he befriended a well-known [[Brazil]]ian epidemiologist, [[Carlos Chagas]], who in 1909 had discovered [[American trypanosomiasis]]. Mazza was named Laboratories Director of the Clinical Hospital and Dean of the [[Bacteriology]] Course at the UBA, in 1920. Traveling to [[France]] in 1923, he and his wife accepted noted bacteriologist [[Charles Nicolle]]'s invitation to the [[Pasteur Institute]]'s [[Algiers]] branch, where they studied Dr. Nicolle's methods in the treatment of [[typhus]] (Nicolle was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for his efforts). Returning to Argentina in 1925, Mazza was given a prominent post in the UBA Surgical Clinic and shortly afterwards invited Nicolle to Buenos Aires, where they discussed the need for more vigorous action against the contagious diseases affecting the country's poor.<ref name=chagas/>\n\n===Struggle against disease and indifference===\nThese discussions resulted in support from the school's Dean of Anatomy, Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Arce]], for the establishment of a medical mission in Argentina's underdeveloped north. The Regional Pathologies Study Mission (MEPRA) was established in then-feudal [[Jujuy Province]], in February 1926. Installed in a railway car, Mazza laboratory undertook studies on trypanosomiasis and [[leishmaniasis]], among other diseases. Publishing regular reports, the mobile lab traveled from village to village to not only inform the then-mostly illiterate population of the nature of their common diseases; but also to help control the known disease vector ''[[Triatoma infestans]]'', a true bug ([[Hemiptera]]) known locally as the ''winchuka''<ref>{{Ref Laime}}</ref> ''(vinchuca)''. The death of a symptomatic [[dog]] in 1926 ultimately led to Mazza's confirmation of the existence of the causal pathogen,''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', in Argentina, in 1927.<ref name=chagas/>\n\nMazza established Scientific Societies in seven northern provinces in 1926-27 to help coordinate his studies and diffuse information. He was assisted by, among others, Dr. Guillermo Paterson, an [[English Argentine]] epidemiologist known for his work on [[malaria]]. His efforts, however, encountered indifference and, then, resistance from the area's landed gentry, who generally saw squalor and contagious disease as an externality, and feared that Mazza's efforts might trigger a peasant revolt. His campaign to incinerate rural [[thatch]]ed roofs, a habitat for vinchucas, was particularly controversial. A fascist, 1930 [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the aging President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]], moreover, led to the elimination of funding for the MEPRA the following year, after which Mazza maintained the facility with donations and his own funds. His efforts forced the South American medical community to accept the validity of trypanosomiasis (making it the special topic of the prestigious VI National Congress of Medicine, in 1939), and yielded the first detailed description of the dynamic between living conditions, trypanosomiasis, and its insect vector.<ref name=fac/>\n\nA letter in 1942 to the renowned Scottish scientist, Dr. [[Alexander Fleming]], led to his cooperation in the 1943 establishment of the first Argentine [[penicillin]] manufacturer - despite ongoing government refusal of support.  The struggling MEPRA had, by 1944, published 551 articles in peer-reviewed journals (including 482 by Mazza, himself). He was then invited to the First International [[Brucellosis]] Congress, in [[Monterrey, Mexico]], in November 1946.<ref name=margen>[http://www.almargen.com.ar/sitio/seccion/actualidad/chagas/ Al margen: Mal de Chagas {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nOn November 9, 1946, Dr. Salvador Mazza suffered a sudden, severe attack of [[hypotension]], which resulted in his death at age 60. His death was the likely result of trypanosomiasis, the disease he had largely succeeded in controlling in Argentina.<ref name=margen/>\n\nMEPRA remained in operation until persistent budget cuts forced the closure of its last laboratory, a two-room facility in the [[La Paternal]] section of Buenos Aires, in 1959.<ref name=margen/> The story was dramatized for the [[Argentine cinema]] in 1995 by [[Juan Bautista Stagnaro]]'s ''[[Casas de fuego]]'' (\"Houses of Fire\"), in which the renowned epidemiologist was portrayed by [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1]].<ref>[http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=359 Cine Nacional: Casas de Fuego {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mazza, Salvador}}\n[[Category:Argentine public health doctors]]\n[[Category:University of Buenos Aires faculty]]\n[[Category:Argentine philanthropists]]\n[[Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Buenos Aires Province]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Sicilian descent]]\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1946 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century philanthropists]]\n[[Category:Argentine health officials]]\n", "text_old": "{{Expand Spanish|Salvador Mazza|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n| name                    = Salvador Mazza\n| image                   = Salvador Mazza.JPG\n| image_size              = \n| caption                 = \n| birth_date              = June 6, 1886\n| birth_place             = [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]\n| death_date              = {{death date and age|1946|11|9|1886|6|6}} \n| death_place             = [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]]\n| nationality             = Argentinian\n| field                   = Physician<br>Epidemiology\n| work_institution        = \n| alma_mater              = [[University of Buenos Aires]]\n| doctoral_advisor        = \n| doctoral_students       = \n| known_for               = [[American trypanosomiasis]]\n| author_abbreviation_bot = \n| author_abbreviation_zoo = \n| awards = \n| prizes                  = \n| religion                = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n\n\n'''Salvador Mazza''' (June 6, 1886{{spaced ndash}}November 9, 1946) was a noted Argentine physician and epidemiologist, best known for his strides in helping control [[American trypanosomiasis]], an endemic disease among the rural, poor majority of early 20th century [[South America]].<ref name=fac>[http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas {{in lang|es}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204113113/http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |date=2009-12-04 }}</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\n===Early career===\nMazza was born in [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]], [[Buenos Aires]]<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939D-R89M-N4?i=516&cc=1974184&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AXN8P-9WL Baptismal record of Salvador Mazza]</ref>, to Francesco Mazza and Giuseppa Alfise (both immigrants from [[Sicily]]), in 1886, and was raised in [[Rauch, Buenos Aires|Rauch]], a small [[pampas]] town.

There, he befriended a well-known [[Brazil]]ian epidemiologist, [[Carlos Chagas]], who in 1909 had discovered [[American trypanosomiasis]]. Mazza was named Laboratories Director of the Clinical Hospital and Dean of the [[Bacteriology]] Course at the UBA, in 1920. Traveling to [[France]] in 1923, he and his wife accepted noted bacteriologist [[Charles Nicolle]]'s invitation to the [[Pasteur Institute]]'s [[Algiers]] branch, where they studied Dr. Nicolle's methods in the treatment of [[typhus]] (Nicolle was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for his efforts). Returning to Argentina in 1925, Mazza was given a prominent post in the UBA Surgical Clinic and shortly afterwards invited Nicolle to Buenos Aires, where they discussed the need for more vigorous action against the contagious diseases affecting the country's poor.<ref name=chagas/>\n\n===Struggle against disease and indifference===\nThese discussions resulted in support from the school's Dean of Anatomy, Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Arce]], for the establishment of a medical mission in Argentina's underdeveloped north. The Regional Pathologies Study Mission (MEPRA) was established in then-feudal [[Jujuy Province]], in February 1926. Installed in a railway car, Mazza laboratory undertook studies on trypanosomiasis and [[leishmaniasis]], among other diseases. Publishing regular reports, the mobile lab traveled from village to village to not only inform the then-mostly illiterate population of the nature of their common diseases; but also to help control the known disease vector ''[[Triatoma infestans]]'', a true bug ([[Hemiptera]]) known locally as the ''winchuka''<ref>{{Ref Laime}}</ref> ''(vinchuca)''. The death of a symptomatic [[dog]] in 1926 ultimately led to Mazza's confirmation of the existence of the causal pathogen,''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'', in Argentina, in 1927.<ref name=chagas/>\n\nMazza established Scientific Societies in seven northern provinces in 1926-27 to help coordinate his studies and diffuse information. He was assisted by, among others, Dr. Guillermo Paterson, an [[English Argentine]] epidemiologist known for his work on [[malaria]]. His efforts, however, encountered indifference and, then, resistance from the area's landed gentry, who generally saw squalor and contagious disease as an externality, and feared that Mazza's efforts might trigger a peasant revolt. His campaign to incinerate rural [[thatch]]ed roofs, a habitat for vinchucas, was particularly controversial. A fascist, 1930 [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the aging President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen]], moreover, led to the elimination of funding for the MEPRA the following year, after which Mazza maintained the facility with donations and his own funds. His efforts forced the South American medical community to accept the validity of trypanosomiasis (making it the special topic of the prestigious VI National Congress of Medicine, in 1939), and yielded the first detailed description of the dynamic between living conditions, trypanosomiasis, and its insect vector.<ref name=fac/>\n\nA letter in 1942 to the renowned Scottish scientist, Dr. [[Alexander Fleming]], led to his cooperation in the 1943 establishment of the first Argentine [[penicillin]] manufacturer - despite ongoing government refusal of support.  The struggling MEPRA had, by 1944, published 551 articles in peer-reviewed journals (including 482 by Mazza, himself). He was then invited to the First International [[Brucellosis]] Congress, in [[Monterrey, Mexico]], in November 1946.<ref name=margen>[http://www.almargen.com.ar/sitio/seccion/actualidad/chagas/ Al margen: Mal de Chagas {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nOn November 9, 1946, Dr. Salvador Mazza suffered a sudden, severe attack of [[hypotension]], which resulted in his death at age 60. His death was the likely result of trypanosomiasis, the disease he had largely succeeded in controlling in Argentina.<ref name=margen/>\n\nMEPRA remained in operation until persistent budget cuts forced the closure of its last laboratory, a two-room facility in the [[La Paternal]] section of Buenos Aires, in 1959.<ref name=margen/> The story was dramatized for the [[Argentine cinema]] in 1995 by [[Juan Bautista Stagnaro]]'s ''[[Casas de fuego]]'' (\"Houses of Fire\"), in which the renowned epidemiologist was portrayed by [[Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1]].<ref>[http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=359 Cine Nacional: Casas de Fuego {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mazza, Salvador}}\n[[Category:Argentine public health doctors]]\n[[Category:University of Buenos Aires faculty]]\n[[Category:Argentine philanthropists]]\n[[Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Buenos Aires Province]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Sicilian descent]]\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1946 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century philanthropists]]\n[[Category:Argentine health officials]]\n", "name_user": "Dantadd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife and work", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Mazza"}

Ravikumar]], [[Saranya Ponvannan]] and [[Sri Divya]] portray supporting roles. The cinematography was handled by [[P. C. Sreeram]], and editing work was done by [[Ruben (editor)|Ruben]].

The soundtrack album and background score has been composed by [[Anirudh Ravichander]], and the soundtrack received positive response, upon release. The film follows, SK (played by Sivakarthikeyan) an aspiring actor, who decides to don as a female nurse, to test his acting skills and also to win the hearts of his lady love, who is a doctor by profession.\n\nThis is the debut film produced by R. D. Raja, who earlier worked as a creative producer for Sivakarthikeyan, in his movies [[Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam|''Varuthapadatha'' ''Vaalibar Sangam'']]'', [[Maan Karate]]'', ''[[Kaaki Sattai|Kakki Sattai]]'' and ''[[Rajini Murugan]].'' Earlier he started his career a promotion consultant, for movies [[Boss Engira Bhaskaran|''Boss Engira Baskaran'']], ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[Jilla]]''. The film was initially scheduled to release on 14 March 2015, but was briefly delayed due to the script completion, and finalizing the cast and crew. The project was started, with the announcement of technical crew on 1 July 2015.<ref name=\":2\" /> Principal photography of this film, took place on 25 October 2015, in Chennai, and continued till 2 August 2016;<ref name=\":3\" /> Filming was held in Chennai, Vizag and Pondicherry. The film's title ''Remo'' was announced on February 2016.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe film had a worldwide theatrical release on 7 October 2016, coinciding with the occasion of [[Vijayadashami|Dusshera]] festival. The film received mixed to positive  reviews from critics, praising Sivakarthikeyan's acting in the role of a female nurse, and the efforts he took for donning the make over. However, the film faced criticism for glorifying stalking and the way in which Keerthy Suresh's character was written for the film. It became a commercial success grossing {{Indian Rupee|76}} crore, amidst the budget of {{Indian Rupee|35}} crore.<ref name=\":5\" /> The film was dubbed into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] under the same title, and was released on 25 November 2016. It was remade in Odia as ''[[Sister Sridevi]]'' (2017).\n\n== Plot ==\nSiva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]] 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a [[Pune]]-based doctor named Vishwanath alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though becoming disappointed, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of \"Remo\" (short for \"Regina Motwani\", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.\n\nEnsuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day because Vishwa saw Kavya enjoying with Siva. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away.It was also shown early that Vishwa had only lust for Kavya as she was very beautiful.  Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to the hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan named Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would \"change himself\" to a man as a \"magic trick\"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.\n\nA few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.\n\nThe film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo O Premikudu'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress [[Sri Divya]] plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Siva Karthikeyan \"Siva\"/\"SK\", Regina Motwani \"Remo\" and Thatha\n*[[Keerthy Suresh]] as Dr. Kavya\n*[[Sathish]] as Vallikanth\n*[[K.

Earlier he started his career a promotion consultant, for movies [[Boss Engira Bhaskaran|''Boss Engira Baskaran'']], ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[Jilla]]''. The film was initially scheduled to release on 14 March 2015, but was briefly delayed due to the script completion, and finalizing the cast and crew. The project was started, with the announcement of technical crew on 1 July 2015.<ref name=\":2\" /> Principal photography of this film, took place on 25 October 2015, in Chennai, and continued till 2 August 2016;<ref name=\":3\" /> Filming was held in Chennai, Vizag and Pondicherry.

The film received mixed to positive  reviews from critics, praising Sivakarthikeyan's acting in the role of a female nurse, and the efforts he took for donning the make over. However, the film faced criticism for glorifying stalking and the way in which Keerthy Suresh's character was written for the film. It became a commercial success grossing {{Indian Rupee|76}} crore, amidst the budget of {{Indian Rupee|35}} crore.<ref name=\":5\" /> The film was dubbed into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] under the same title, and was released on 25 November 2016. It was remade in Odia as ''[[Sister Sridevi]]'' (2017).\n\n== Plot ==\nSiva aka S.K ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like [[Rajinikanth]]. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director [[K. S. Ravikumar]] during the audition for his new film ''[[Avvai Shanmugi]] 2''. He comes across Kavya ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a [[Pune]]-based doctor named Vishwanath alias Vishwa ([[Anson Paul]]). Siva, though becoming disappointed, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of \"Remo\" (short for \"Regina Motwani\", a combination of the names of actresses [[Regina Cassandra]] and [[Hansika Motwani]]), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.\n\nEnsuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organizes a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day because Vishwa saw Kavya enjoying with Siva. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away.It was also shown early that Vishwa had only lust for Kavya as she was very beautiful.  Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to the hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan named Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would \"change himself\" to a man as a \"magic trick\"), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.\n\nA few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her, to which he happily agrees.\n\nThe film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth ([[Sathish]]) in a movie which seems to be his life story named ''Remo Nee Kadhalan'' (''Remo O Premikudu'' and ''Remo Ninda Premam'' in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress [[Sri Divya]] plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Siva Karthikeyan \"Siva\"/\"SK\", Regina Motwani \"Remo\" and Thatha\n*[[Keerthy Suresh]] as Dr. Kavya\n*[[Sathish]] as Vallikanth\n*[[K.
