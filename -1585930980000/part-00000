It was shot in [[Morocco]] and [[Malta]]. It stars [[Jeremy Sisto]] as the titular character, [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary of Nazareth]], [[Debra Messing]] as [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Pontius Pilate]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe film's chronology entails a cinematic blending of the Four Gospels with the addition of extra-biblical elements not found in the [[New Testament]] accounts. It provides a down to earth approach through its focus on the human aspect of Jesus. Compared to more solemn and divine portrayals in earlier films, Jesus expresses emotions weeping at [[Saint Joseph|Joseph's]] funeral, throwing stones in [[Lake Galilee]] upon meeting [[Saint Peter|Simon Peter]] and [[Saint James the Great|James son of Zebedee]], dancing at the wedding at [[Cana]], and starting a water-splashing fight with his disciples.\n\nWhile the film mainly presented familiar Christian Episodes, it provides extra-biblical scenes such as flashbacks of his first trip to Jerusalem with John as well as scenes of war and destruction waged in the name of Jesus during the medieval and modern times. Likewise, the film's [[Satan]] comes in two different forms: a visual exemplification of a modern man and a woman in red, instead of the traditional snake that can be found in most films. The film also adds a [[composite character]], an [[apocryphal]] Roman historian named \"Livio\" who watches and comments as events unfold; he is presumably named after [[Livy]]. The film has been generally well received but it also been criticized for having an unrealistic Crucifixion scene as the person nailing Jesus to the cross is not a Roman Soldier but a Jew from the crowd. It has also been criticized for having a highly unsympathetic portrayal of Pontius Pilate, who appears to deliberately do everything to annoy the Jews, which is unlike most other media works in which he is usually depicted as an unwilling gentile participant dragged by the Sanhedrin into the unjust proceedings.\n \nAs it appears in the credits, it was dedicated in memory of [[Enrico Sabbatini]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph the carpenter]]\n* [[Debra Messing]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[David O'Hara]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[G.

During the days of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] and King [[Herod the Great]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is visited by the angel [[Gabriel]] who tells her that she will give birth to [[Jesus]], the [[Son of God]]. Later, Mary visits [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]], who tells her that she is the most blessed of women and that her child is blessed.\n\nWhen the Romans hold a census, Mary travels with her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] to his hometown of [[Bethlehem]] to register. There, Jesus is born in a manger. A week later, Mary and Joseph travel to [[Jerusalem]] to present Jesus at the [[Second Temple|Temple]]. There, they are greeted by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a [[Passover]] trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in [[God|His Father]]'s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]] and King [[Herod Antipas]], John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends upon Jesus.\n\nJesus is subsequently [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]] in the wilderness by [[Satan]] but withstands the Devil's trials. Travelling to [[Capernaum]], Jesus recruits the disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|resurrects]] the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve [[apostle]]s from among His disciples including [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Judas Iscariot]]. Jesus' followers also include several women including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Joanna, wife of Chuza|Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]].\n\nThe film covers several of Jesus' teachings and messages including the [[Pharisee and the Publican|parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector]], the [[Beatitudes]], the [[Golden Rule]], loving your enemy, and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. While visiting the home of the [[Pharisee]] [[Simon the Pharisee|Simon]], a sinful woman [[Anointing of Jesus|anoints]] Jesus' feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the [[Sea of Galilee]] where he calms the storm. At [[Gerasa]], Jesus [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|exorcises]] a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At [[Bethsaida]], Jesus [[Feeding the multitude|feeds]] five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] and is [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]].\n\nAs Jesus' preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector [[Zaccheus]], convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the [[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Tenants]] and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.\n\nAt the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies knowing Jesus]] three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before by [[Pontius Pilate]], who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the Jesus leaders and crowd demand Jesus' death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is obliged to carry his cross. At [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus' death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] back to [[Heaven]], Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Rivka Neumann]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] \n* [[Yosef Shiloach]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Talia Shapira]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Alexander Scourby]] as [[Saint Luke|Luke]]\n* [[Niko Nitai]] as [[Simon Peter]]\n* [[Ori Levy]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Mosko Alkalai]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Kobi Assaf]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Moti Baharav]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* [[Ya'ackov Ben-Sira]] as [[Zacchaeus]]\n* [[Ze'ev Berlinski]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Eli Cohen (actor)|Eli Cohen]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Eli Danker]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Dina Doron]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Shoshana Duer]] as the hunchback woman in the temple\n* [[Peter Frye]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Nisim Gerama]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* David Goldberg as [[Jude the Apostle|Judas]], son of James\n* [[Timothy Mark Hanson]] as the rich young ruler\n* [[Yftach Katzur]] as the epileptic boy\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Avi Loziah]] as the demonic man\n* [[Miki Mfir]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* [[Yitzhak Ne'eman]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* [[Shmuel Ornstein]] as [[Simon Peter|Simeon]]\n* [[Richard Peterson (actor)|Richard Peterson]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Milo Rafi]] as [[Simon Zelotes]]\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Annas]]\n* [[Gad Roll]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Israel Rubinek]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Michael Schneider (actor)|Michael Schneider]] as the father of the epileptic boy\n* [[Nahum Shalit]] as [[Jairus]]\n* [[Shmuel Tal]] as [[John the Evangelist|John]]\n* [[Michael Warshaviak]] as [[Saint Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]\n* [[Leonid Weinstein]] as James, son of Alphaeus\n* [[Rolf Brin]] as the centurian in charge of the [[Crucifixion]]\n* [[Dov Friedman]] as the soldier nailing sign to cross\n* [[Oshik Levi]] as Desmas, Good Thief on Cross\n* [[Nissan Nativ]] as John's disciple\n* Kevin O'Shea as Gestas, bad thief on cross\n* [[Yossi Pollak]] as the ruler of the [[Synagogue]]\n* [[Dada Rubin]] as the herdsmen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bill Bright]], founder of the [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], spent a lot of time in his early career trying to convert Hollywood celebrities in [[Los Angeles]], and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, the [[British Jews|British Jewish]] film and television producer [[John Heyman]] approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked the-then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.\n\nEshleman was pleased with Heyman's short film on the first two chapters of the [[Gospel of Luke]] and convince Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from [[clergy]] and scholars.{{sfn|Turner|2008|181-182}} On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: \"I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.\" Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' or ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAfter failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the ''Jesus'' film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Bunker and Caroline Hunt]] for a sum of $6 million.<ref>Come Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144-145</ref><ref>Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination Jeffrey Lloyd Staley, Richard G.

In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast [[Yemenite Jews]] as [[Extra (acting)|background extras]] because, according to Eshleman, \"their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.\" Filming began late November, 1978 on location in [[Tiberias]], Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers \"were required to [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-film]] three days' work,\" because they \"had shown [[eucalyptus tree]]s in a variety of shots,\" when, \"Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later\".<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nDeacon grew his hair and beard during the production, but producer Jon Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig over his hair, and as well as a [[prosthetic]] nose so that he had a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean look]]. Former [[Jesus Film Project]] director Paul Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the [[DVD]]'s [[audio commentary]] that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several [[Bible translations]] a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings.<ref>DVD audio commentary</ref> Because Deacon developed [[pneumonia]] during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon's dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nEshleman revealed that Niko Nitai, the actor who played Peter, became a believer during the shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/> Heyman's original cut of the ''Jesus'' film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the native dialect of the [[Israeli people|Israeli]] cast members and decided that they all should be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over by [[English people|English]] voice actors using the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183}}\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the [[United States]] in over 2000 cinemas, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an \u201covertly religious picture.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> To promote the film, Paul Eshleman worked with both [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Catholic]] churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watch the ''Jesus'' film in late 1979 and 1980. However, though the film was popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream audiences. It was not a financial success and left John Heyman's Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183-184}}\n\nThe release date varied between countries; In [[Australia]], it was released on April 3, 1980; in [[Portugal]] on April 9, 1981; in [[Sweden]] on November 1, 1985; in [[Finland]] on March 14, 1986; in [[Hungary]] on 13 December 1990; and in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1991. Nonetheless, the film has been presented in 229 nations, being screened in dozens of large cities to the smallest villages in a lot of different countries.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. received backlash for distributing the film simultaneously with ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), a Warner Bros. release that was stigmatised by some religious leaders for its satirical characterisation of events surrounding Jesus Christ, although the studio considered the coinciding releases as \u201c\u2018something for everybody.\u2019\u201d Yet the producers of this film evaluated whether to take [[legal action]] against the studio for a conflict of interest.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDespite the [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Flagellation of Christ|flagellation]] scenes, the film was rated G by the [[MPAA]] and, likewise in Australia, it was rated G by the [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]].<ref>[http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=z4wGCPclUAizfV7jm7FavA%253d%253d&ncdctx=9vxqzCN0E0g2pGK%252fYZeqBPoKesvkQPIRy%252fR%252f9q4L6alIhwqf3pH0wEiPVY3KVDph JESUS (VIDEOTAPE)] by the ACB</ref> In the UK, however, the film was rated PG by the [[BBFC]].<ref>[https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/jesus-1979 JESUS (1979) \u2013 British Board of Film Classification]</ref>\n\n===Latter versions===\n[[File:Jesus.film.1979.jpg|thumb|170px|2004 DVD poster.]]\n;1999-2002\nTo make the film more relevant for younger viewers, new footage for ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' was filmed in 1999. Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edited version of the original film ''Jesus'' and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the [[Creationism|creation of humans]], the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], [[Abraham]]'s blocked [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of his son, and the prophesies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of ''Jesus'' commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] was distributed in the [[VHS]] format. It contains introductions by [[New York City]] [[New York City Fire Department|firefighters]] and [[New York Police Department|police officers]] and has a running time of 83 minutes.\n\n;2003\nAn edited [[DVD]] version of ''Jesus'' was also packaged with ''JESUS: Fact or Fiction?'', which was produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the \"Journey of Spiritual Discovery\". Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a \"discovery glass\" icon, can access relevant comments. After they are finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.\n\nThe version was promoted to Muslims of [[Iraq]] during the hardships of the [[Iraqi War]], where its website featured a banner advert that said \"Send videocassettes of 'JESUS' to Iraq\".

Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions of his film. When Campus Crusade produced a shorter version ''The Story of Jesus for Children'', which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.{{sfn|Turner|2008|184}}\n\nRegarding the foreign reception, documentary maker Seghal said \"The events we witnessed were often bewildering,\" he says. \"But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> After the film's reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly [[Religious conversion|converting]].

The first translation was done for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking people of the [[Philippines]].  One of the group's first projects, they ordered for the broadcast of a Hindi version in [[Indian television]]. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture.

In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both ''Jesus'' and ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' are available in [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available.

It's because those people haven't had a chance. That's all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the [[Christian mission|message of Christ]] in an understandable language near where they live.\" John Meyer, one of the team members who has helped distributing and translating the film, has said, \"I'm willing to lay down my life for Jesus, should it come to that,\" he told the documentary maker Sehgal. \"So if there's a recording in a war-torn country, I'm more than willing to go.

During the days of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Augustus]] and King [[Herod the Great]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is visited by the angel [[Gabriel]] who tells her that she will give birth to [[Jesus]], the [[Son of God]]. Later, Mary visits [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]], the mother of [[John the Baptist]], who tells her that she is the most blessed of women and that her child is blessed.\n\nWhen the Romans hold a census, Mary travels with her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] to his hometown of [[Bethlehem]] to register. There, Jesus is born in a manger. A week later, Mary and Joseph travel to [[Jerusalem]] to present Jesus at the [[Second Temple|Temple]]. There, they are greeted by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], who blesses Jesus as the Christ. At the age of twelve, Jesus becomes separated from his parents during a [[Passover]] trip to Jerusalem. When Mary asks about his whereabouts, Jesus tells them that he was in [[God|His Father]]'s house. Years later, during the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]] and King [[Herod Antipas]], John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Holy Spirit]] descends upon Jesus.\n\nJesus is subsequently [[Temptation of Christ|tempted]] in the wilderness by [[Satan]] but withstands the Devil's trials. Travelling to [[Capernaum]], Jesus recruits the disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] after helping them to find a large haul of fish. During his preaching ministry, Jesus [[Raising of Jairus' daughter|resurrects]] the daughter of Jairus. Jesus then recruits twelve [[apostle]]s from among His disciples including [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Judas Iscariot]]. Jesus' followers also include several women including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Joanna, wife of Chuza|Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]].\n\nThe film covers several of Jesus' teachings and messages including the [[Pharisee and the Publican|parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector]], the [[Beatitudes]], the [[Golden Rule]], loving your enemy, and the [[Parable of the Sower]]. While visiting the home of the [[Pharisee]] [[Simon the Pharisee|Simon]], a sinful woman [[Anointing of Jesus|anoints]] Jesus' feet, prompting Jesus to forgive her sins. Jesus and his disciples later travel across the [[Sea of Galilee]] where he calms the storm. At [[Gerasa]], Jesus [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|exorcises]] a demon-possessed man and the demons enter a herd of swine. At [[Bethsaida]], Jesus [[Feeding the multitude|feeds]] five thousand with five loaves and two pieces of fish. Later, Jesus and his disciples travel up a mountain where Jesus encounters the prophets [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] and is [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfigured]].\n\nAs Jesus' preaching and healing ministry grows, he reaches out to the sinners and outcasts including prostitutes and tax collectors, earning the ire of the Pharisees and religious teachers. Jesus also befriends the tax collector [[Zaccheus]], convincing him to repay people he has extorted. While preaching the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus befriends a little girl and tells his disciples not to forbid the little children from coming to Him. Jesus draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders, and Romans after he drives the merchants out of the Temple. In Jerusalem, Jesus teaches the [[Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen|Parable of the Tenants]] and to pay taxes to Caesar. At the [[Last Supper]], Jesus warns his disciples of his impending betrayal and death. Judas conspires with the religious leaders to betray Jesus.\n\nAt the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus is betrayed by Judas and captured by the Jewish authorities. [[Denial of Peter|Peter denies knowing Jesus]] three times before the cock crows. The following day, Jesus is condemned by the religious leaders. He is then brought before by [[Pontius Pilate]], who sends him to Herod. While Pilate exonerates Jesus of wrongdoing, the Jesus leaders and crowd demand Jesus' death. After being scourged, Jesus is forced to carry his cross through the streets. When he collapses from exhaustion, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is obliged to carry his cross. At [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus is crucified besides two robbers, one of whom recognizes him as the Messiah. Following Jesus' death at noon, the sky is plunged into darkness and the curtain of the Temple is ripped through the middle. [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Jesus in a tomb. Jesus rises from the dead on the third day. Before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] back to [[Heaven]], Jesus tells his disciples that all power and authority has been given to Him and commands them to go and make disciples of all nations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brian Deacon]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Rivka Neumann]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] \n* [[Yosef Shiloach]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Talia Shapira]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Alexander Scourby]] as [[Saint Luke|Luke]]\n* [[Niko Nitai]] as [[Simon Peter]]\n* [[Ori Levy]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[Mosko Alkalai]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Kobi Assaf]] as [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]\n* [[Moti Baharav]] as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n* [[Ya'ackov Ben-Sira]] as [[Zacchaeus]]\n* [[Ze'ev Berlinski]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Eli Cohen (actor)|Eli Cohen]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Eli Danker]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Dina Doron]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Shoshana Duer]] as the hunchback woman in the temple\n* [[Peter Frye]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Nisim Gerama]] as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]]\n* David Goldberg as [[Jude the Apostle|Judas]], son of James\n* [[Timothy Mark Hanson]] as the rich young ruler\n* [[Yftach Katzur]] as the epileptic boy\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as [[Herodias]]\n* [[Avi Loziah]] as the demonic man\n* [[Miki Mfir]] as [[Simon the Pharisee]]\n* [[Yitzhak Ne'eman]] as [[James, brother of Jesus|James]]\n* [[Shmuel Ornstein]] as [[Simon Peter|Simeon]]\n* [[Richard Peterson (actor)|Richard Peterson]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Milo Rafi]] as [[Simon Zelotes]]\n* [[Shmuel Rodensky]] as [[Annas]]\n* [[Gad Roll]] as [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]]\n* [[Israel Rubinek]] as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n* [[Michael Schneider (actor)|Michael Schneider]] as the father of the epileptic boy\n* [[Nahum Shalit]] as [[Jairus]]\n* [[Shmuel Tal]] as [[John the Evangelist|John]]\n* [[Michael Warshaviak]] as [[Saint Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]\n* [[Leonid Weinstein]] as James, son of Alphaeus\n* [[Rolf Brin]] as the centurian in charge of the [[Crucifixion]]\n* [[Dov Friedman]] as the soldier nailing sign to cross\n* [[Oshik Levi]] as Desmas, Good Thief on Cross\n* [[Nissan Nativ]] as John's disciple\n* Kevin O'Shea as Gestas, bad thief on cross\n* [[Yossi Pollak]] as the ruler of the [[Synagogue]]\n* [[Dada Rubin]] as the herdsmen\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Bill Bright]], founder of the [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], spent a lot of time in his early career trying to convert Hollywood celebrities in [[Los Angeles]], and he aspired to make a compelling film about the life of Christ. In 1976, the [[British Jews|British Jewish]] film and television producer [[John Heyman]] approached Bright to fund his Genesis Project to put the entire Bible on film and to obtain financing for his feature-length film on Jesus. After meeting Heyman, Bright asked the-then campus ministry director Paul Eshleman to consult with the filmmaker.\n\nEshleman was pleased with Heyman's short film on the first two chapters of the [[Gospel of Luke]] and convince Bright to endorse the project despite objections from other Campus Crusade leaders who objected to a non-Christian making a film about the Bible. Most of the film's dialogue comes from Luke, which was chosen after Heyman sought advice from [[clergy]] and scholars.{{sfn|Turner|2008|181-182}} On his motivation about the Jesus film, Heyman said: \"I believed the best-selling book in the world would sell a lot of 8-millimeter and 16-millimeter films.\" Instead of creating a parallel story for the film or embellishing the biblical account, as is the case with other biblical films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' or ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the filmmakers chose to adhere as closely as possible to the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAfter failing to canvass funding from Hollywood studios, the ''Jesus'' film would be financed primarily by Campus Crusade supporters [[Nelson Bunker Hunt|Bunker and Caroline Hunt]] for a sum of $6 million.<ref>Come Help Change the World, by Bill Bright, pages 144-145</ref><ref>Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination Jeffrey Lloyd Staley, Richard G.

In addition to 45 main actors, who were mainly Israelis, another 5,000 extras were involved in the filming. The filmmakers cast [[Yemenite Jews]] as [[Extra (acting)|background extras]] because, according to Eshleman, \"their facial features have changed the least over 2,000 years.\" Filming began late November, 1978 on location in [[Tiberias]], Israel, which continued for 31 weeks throughout the country, including the cities of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]]. During the production, Heyman revealed that the filmmakers \"were required to [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-film]] three days' work,\" because they \"had shown [[eucalyptus tree]]s in a variety of shots,\" when, \"Eucalyptus trees were introduced to Palestine very much later\".<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nDeacon grew his hair and beard during the production, but producer Jon Heyman had decided for Deacon to wear a wig over his hair, and as well as a [[prosthetic]] nose so that he had a [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean look]]. Former [[Jesus Film Project]] director Paul Eshleman, who was on location during much of the principal photography, revealed in the [[DVD]]'s [[audio commentary]] that Deacon was so committed to the film and its message that he read several [[Bible translations]] a day in order to make certain that he properly presented Christ's teachings.<ref>DVD audio commentary</ref> Because Deacon developed [[pneumonia]] during principal photography, doubles were used in certain scenes. Deacon's dialogue mostly comprises full-length passages of scripture, and he is scarcely depicted doing anything other than making miracles and uttering speeches.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nEshleman revealed that Niko Nitai, the actor who played Peter, became a believer during the shooting. As for special effects, the film features puffs of smoke and transparent [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] to indicate miracles and angel figures, and a hissing snake and a deep voiceover represent Satan.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/> Heyman's original cut of the ''Jesus'' film ran for more than four hours. However, in consultation with Bright and Eshleman, he edited a shorter version for Campus Crusade. Just after filming, Heyman was not satisfied with the native dialect of the [[Israeli people|Israeli]] cast members and decided that they all should be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] over by [[English people|English]] voice actors using the [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183}}\n\n==Release==\n''Jesus'' was released by [[Warner Bros.]] in the [[United States]] in over 2000 cinemas, which delineated a rare instance of a major studio releasing an \u201covertly religious picture.\u201d<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> To promote the film, Paul Eshleman worked with both [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Catholic]] churches to arrange group trips and discounts. Four million viewers reportedly watch the ''Jesus'' film in late 1979 and 1980. However, though the film was popular with Christian audiences, it failed to attract mainstream audiences. It was not a financial success and left John Heyman's Genesis Project US$4 million in debt.{{sfn|Turner|2008|183-184}}\n\nThe release date varied between countries; In [[Australia]], it was released on April 3, 1980; in [[Portugal]] on April 9, 1981; in [[Sweden]] on November 1, 1985; in [[Finland]] on March 14, 1986; in [[Hungary]] on 13 December 1990; and in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1991.

Being less violent than the original, it was interwoven into an edited version of the original film ''Jesus'' and released in 2000. In 2001, a new opening sequence depicting the [[Creationism|creation of humans]], the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], [[Abraham]]'s blocked [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of his son, and the prophesies of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] was filmed to show, as Paul Eshleman states in the audio commentary, how Jesus' life fits into the span of history. In 2002, a special edition of ''Jesus'' commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] was distributed in the [[VHS]] format. It contains introductions by [[New York City]] [[New York City Fire Department|firefighters]] and [[New York Police Department|police officers]] and has a running time of 83 minutes.\n\n;2003\nAn edited [[DVD]] version of ''Jesus'' was also packaged with ''JESUS: Fact or Fiction?'', which was produced in 2003 by Inspirational Films. This features a section called the \"Journey of Spiritual Discovery\". Biblical scholars, historians, philosophers, authors, and ministers answer specific questions relating to God, Jesus, Christianity, the archaeological, scientific and historical accuracy of the Bible, and testimony from many Christians. Viewers can browse the numerous topics individually or they can watch the film and, when prompted by a \"discovery glass\" icon, can access relevant comments. After they are finished, the viewer is returned to the scene they were watching.\n\nThe version was promoted to Muslims of [[Iraq]] during the hardships of the [[Iraqi War]], where its website featured a banner advert that said \"Send videocassettes of 'JESUS' to Iraq\".

Heyman also objected to Campus Crusade making multiple different versions of his film. When Campus Crusade produced a shorter version ''The Story of Jesus for Children'', which included new footage, Heyman sued Crusade on the grounds that the new version damaged his reputation. Though the dispute was settled by the parties out of court, relations between Heyman and Campus Crusade remained poor.{{sfn|Turner|2008|184}}\n\nRegarding the foreign reception, documentary maker Seghal said \"The events we witnessed were often bewildering,\" he says. \"But what struck us most was the utter normality of those who were willing to risk their lives for Christ.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> After the film's reels were sent to remote settlements in Africa, Asia and Latin America, they returned with reports of audiences being in tears during screening with others instantly [[Religious conversion|converting]].

Based on the distribution rate by 2005, JVP did not expect to reach countrywide status until 2040 or later.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> As of August 2018, over 8 billion viewers were reported through in-person film showings, online platforms and apps.<ref>[https://www.jesusfilm.org/about/learn-more/statistics.html Jesusfilm.org]</ref>\n\n==Foreign language versions==\nIn 1981, [[Bill Bright]] created the Jesus Film Project organization with the goal of accurately translating ''Jesus'' into other languages and showing them around the world. The first translation was done for the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-speaking people of the [[Philippines]].  One of the group's first projects, they ordered for the broadcast of a Hindi version in [[Indian television]]. The organization works with thousands of missionaries around the world to show the film, sometimes to audiences who have never seen a motion picture. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] version of the film is widely distributed in China by the government-linked [[China Christian Council]]'s [[Amity Foundation]] in [[Nanjing]], both on [[VCD]]s and [[DVD]].<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/>\n\nDistribution in the United States has included direct mail campaigns sponsored by churches to deliver a copy of the film to every address in select [[ZIP code]]s across the country, with more than 4.8 million copies sent to Ohio and Texas alone. In 2004, the organization made the film available for viewing on its website in over 300 languages. Both ''Jesus'' and ''The Story of Jesus for Children'' are available in [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] formats. Audio dramatizations in a number of languages are also available. It is the only film that has been dubbed into more than 1000 languages of the world. As of now, more than 1600 languages spoken all over the world have the ''Jesus'' film, including in all major international languages.<ref name=\"AFI CATALOG OF FEATURE FILMS\"/> Also in 2004, 300 employees at an office in [[Orlando, Fl]] translated the film into languages such as [[Kwanyama]], spoken in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]], and as well as the seven [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], a tongue of [[Quechua people]] in the [[Andes]].<ref name=\"NYT Jesus film 2\"/>\n\nRegarding its worldwide spread and translations, Eshleman states, \"People ask 'Why do you go to those far away places?' It's because those people haven't had a chance. That's all we want to do - to give them a chance to hear the [[Christian mission|message of Christ]] in an understandable language near where they live.\" John Meyer, one of the team members who has helped distributing and translating the film, has said, \"I'm willing to lay down my life for Jesus, should it come to that,\" he told the documentary maker Sehgal. \"So if there's a recording in a war-torn country, I'm more than willing to go. Or anywhere else, to be honest.\"<ref name=\"BBC News\"/>\n\nIncidentally, American [[aid worker]]s in [[Afghanistan]], who hadn't been working for the Jesus film project, were arrested by the [[Taliban]] in 2001 for showing the film to a family there. They were ultimately rescued by [[US Marines]], and president [[George W. Bush]] welcomed them back to America, saying: \"It's been an uplifting experience to talk to these courageous souls\".<ref name=\"BBC News\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Depiction of Jesus]]\n* [[King of Kings (1961 film)|''King of Kings'' (1961 film)]]\n* [[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|''Jesus of Nazareth'' (miniseries)]]\n* [[The Gospel of John (film)|''The Gospel of John'' (film)]]\n* ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]''\n* ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''\n* [[Jesus (1999 film)|''Jesus'' (1999 film)]]\n* [[Son of God (film)|''Son of God'' (film)]]\n* ''[[The Visual Bible: Matthew]]''\n* ''[[Magdalena: Released from Shame]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Stanley |first1=Jeffrey L. |last2=Walsh |first2=Richard |title=Jesus, the Gospels, and Cinematic Imagination: A Handbook to Jesus on DVD |date=October 11, 2007 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky]] |isbn=9780664230319}}\n* {{cite book|last=Turner|first=John G.|title=Bill Bright and Campus Crusade for Christ : the renewal of evangelicalism in postwar America|year=2008|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=978-0-8078-3185-4|p=181\u2013187}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jesusfilm.org/ Jesus Film Project]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079368/ ''Jesus''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n* {{AFI film|56823}}\n* {{tcmdb title|79744|Jesus}}\n\n{{Peter Sykes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jesus (1979 Film)}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s biographical films]]\n[[Category:Christian missions]]\n[[Category:Gospel of Luke]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Portrayals of the Virgin Mary in film]]\n[[Category:Films about Evangelicalism]]\n[[Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Krish]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Sykes]]\n[[Category:Foreign films shot in Israel]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical films]]\n[[Category:American epic films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Judas Iscariot]]\n[[Category:Religious epic films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Herod the Great on film]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John the Baptist]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Pontius Pilate]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_(1979_film)"}

It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it marked [[Claude Rains]]'s final film role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] (magi) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence--and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple--[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]--laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child,\" and \"flee.\"\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies shortly after being informed that [apparently] \"not one is alive.\" However, Joseph and Mary have successfully [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's sons [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come.\"\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[Hermit|hermit]]--a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men--[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]--ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[Fishers of men|fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter.\" They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James' brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them--after some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[Synagogue|synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot|A Zealot named Simon]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land--two more men named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] also join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate--among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with his wife's encouragement--she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms Jesus' escape from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]]--the moment of beheading occurs while Salome, Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus' miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], a response that has Jesus anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church.\"\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnesses Jerusalem citizens but concerns the Pharisees.\n\nSoon after, when Judas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], he explains that she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates--many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him--the Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do.\"\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[Thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus--who refuses to take part--notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus--Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus' reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to a tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus--and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]--finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Herod, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises--that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice (they choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world,\" something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then carries his cross [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures to the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers allow a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus give to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus ask why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges--the centurion states that \"truly this man was the son of God\" as an earthquake begins.\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, despite Thomas' weakened faith, Mary Magdalene--along with Peter and others--recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb. Word quickly spreads throughout Jerusalem, the miraculous event bewildering the Pharisees. Caiaphas claims that \"the whole thing will be forgotten in a week,\" while an elder scribe doubts this.\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascends to heaven]] before his disciples, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, leaving them with his final commands as a clouds engulfs him. He then states that he will always be with them, \"even unto the end of the world.\"\n\n==Cast==\nThe major roles in the movie were following:\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as [[Mary mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of [[Satan]])\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as [[James the Just]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Joanna Dunham]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as \"Old Aram\"\n\nSmaller roles (some only a few seconds) were played by [[Michael Ansara]], [[Ina Balin]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Victor Buono]], [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], [[Richard Conte]], [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[David Hedison]], [[Van Heflin]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Lupton]], [[Janet Margolin]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Gary Raymond]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[David Sheiner]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]], [[John Wayne]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Cyril Delevanti]], [[Michael Tolan]], [[Richard Bakalyan]], and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]].\n\n==Pre-production==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at [[Reader's Digest]].<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame.\" Perigree Books, 1984. {{ISBN|0-399-50714-0}}</ref> [[Darryl F.

Stevens created a company, \"The Greatest Story Productions\", to film the novel<ref name=\"GI\"/> and Fox set a budget of $10 million, twice their previous biggest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Three Epics Based on Christ|page=20|date=November 26, 1958|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n247/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greatest-Story-1960.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-production poster from 1960, with [[John Wayne]] as the Centurion]]\nThe screenplay took two years to write.

It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed.<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Reginald Rose]] were considered but neither participated.

Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens also traveled to the Vatican to see [[Pope John XXIII]] for advice.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nIn August 1961, 20th Century Fox withdrew from the project, noting that $2.3 million had been spent without any footage being shot. Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with their own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and when released was nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n==Casting==\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. \"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.\" HarperCollins, 2001. {{ISBN|0-06-093507-3}}</ref> Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.<ref>''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 138</ref>\n\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' featured an ensemble of well-known actors, many of them in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n==Production==\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Cinematographer [[William C. Mellor]] had a fatal heart attack during production; [[Loyal Griggs]], who won an [[Academy Award]] for his cinematography on Stevens\u2019 1953 Western classic ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', was brought in to replace him. Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962\u20131963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor [[David Sheiner]], who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting ''[[Nanook of the North]]''.\"<ref>\"Several hundred volunteers . . braved the elements with shovels, wheelbarrows, bulldozers, and fifty butane flame throwers to remove the snow from the expensive replica of the Holy Land.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 140</ref> Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area \u2013 it was scheduled to become [[Lake Powell]] with the completion of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and the production held up the project.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nStevens brought in two veteran filmmakers. [[Jean Negulesco]] filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets and the Nativity scenes, while [[David Lean]] shot the prologue featuring Herod the Great.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod.<ref>Skal, David J. \"Claude Rains: An Actor\u2019s Voice.\" University Press of Kentucky, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2432-2}}</ref>\n\nBy the time shooting was completed in August 1963, Stevens had amassed six million feet of [[Ultra Panavision 70]] film (about 1829&nbsp;km or 1136 miles, roughly the radius of the Moon). The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to $142 million in 2010) plus additional editing and promotion charges,<ref name=\"Shame p. 142\">''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 142</ref> making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>\"Such giants as ''Cleopatra'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia'' did boast bigger budgets, but they were shot on foreign soil.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\nThe film was advertised on its first run as being shown in [[Cinerama]]. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary and secondary schools. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes and photographs that toured museums around the country.  Promotional items made available to groups identified for [[market segmentation]] included school study guides, children's books and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maresco |first1=Peter A. |title=Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: Market Segmentation, Mass Marketing and Promotion, and the Internet |journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.8.1.002}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' premiered 15 February 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City. Critical reaction toward the movie was divided once it premiered. In its favor, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a big, powerful moving picture demonstrating vast cinematic resource.\" ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated: \"George Stevens has created a novel, reverent and important film with his view of this crucial event in the history of mankind.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"The most distracting nonsense is the pop-up of familiar faces in so-called cameo roles, jarring the illusion.\" [[Shana Alexander]] in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' stated: \"The pace was so stupefying that I felt not uplifted \u2013 but sandbagged!\"<ref name=\"GI\"/> And [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] \u2013 later notorious as the frequently scathing theater and film critic of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' \u2013 wrote: \"God is unlucky in ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.

It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it marked [[Claude Rains]]'s final film role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] (magi) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence--and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple--[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]--laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child,\" and \"flee.\"\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies shortly after being informed that [apparently] \"not one is alive.\" However, Joseph and Mary have successfully [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's sons [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come.\"\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[Hermit|hermit]]--a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men--[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]--ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[Fishers of men|fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter.\" They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James' brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them--after some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[Synagogue|synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot|A Zealot named Simon]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land--two more men named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] also join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate--among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with his wife's encouragement--she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms Jesus' escape from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]]--the moment of beheading occurs while Salome, Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus' miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], a response that has Jesus anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church.\"\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnesses Jerusalem citizens but concerns the Pharisees.\n\nSoon after, when Judas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], he explains that she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates--many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him--the Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do.\"\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[Thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus--who refuses to take part--notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus--Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus' reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to a tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus--and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]--finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Herod, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises--that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice (they choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world,\" something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then carries his cross [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures to the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers allow a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus give to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus ask why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges--the centurion states that \"truly this man was the son of God\" as an earthquake begins.\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, despite Thomas' weakened faith, Mary Magdalene--along with Peter and others--recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb. Word quickly spreads throughout Jerusalem, the miraculous event bewildering the Pharisees. Caiaphas claims that \"the whole thing will be forgotten in a week,\" while an elder scribe doubts this.\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascends to heaven]] before his disciples, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, leaving them with his final commands as a clouds engulfs him. He then states that he will always be with them, \"even unto the end of the world.\"\n\n==Cast==\nThe major roles in the movie were following:\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as [[Mary mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of [[Satan]])\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as [[James the Just]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Joanna Dunham]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as \"Old Aram\"\n\nSmaller roles (some only a few seconds) were played by [[Michael Ansara]], [[Ina Balin]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Victor Buono]], [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], [[Richard Conte]], [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[David Hedison]], [[Van Heflin]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Lupton]], [[Janet Margolin]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Gary Raymond]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[David Sheiner]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]], [[John Wayne]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Cyril Delevanti]], [[Michael Tolan]], [[Richard Bakalyan]], and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]].\n\n==Pre-production==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at [[Reader's Digest]].<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame.\" Perigree Books, 1984. {{ISBN|0-399-50714-0}}</ref> [[Darryl F.

Stevens created a company, \"The Greatest Story Productions\", to film the novel<ref name=\"GI\"/> and Fox set a budget of $10 million, twice their previous biggest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Three Epics Based on Christ|page=20|date=November 26, 1958|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n247/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greatest-Story-1960.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-production poster from 1960, with [[John Wayne]] as the Centurion]]\nThe screenplay took two years to write. Stevens collaborated with [[Ivan Moffat]] and then with [[James Lee Barrett]]. It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed.<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Reginald Rose]] were considered but neither participated. The poet [[Carl Sandburg]] was solicited, though it is not certain if any of his contributions were included. Sandburg, however, did receive screen credit for \"creative association.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>The movie's opening credits include: ''Screenplay by James Lee Barrett and George Stevens, based on the Books of the Old and New Testaments, Other Ancient Writings, the Writings of Fulton Oursler and Henry Denker, and in Creative Association with Carl Sandburg'' (see ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 136)</ref>\n\nFinancial excesses began to grow during pre-production. Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens also traveled to the Vatican to see [[Pope John XXIII]] for advice.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nIn August 1961, 20th Century Fox withdrew from the project, noting that $2.3 million had been spent without any footage being shot. Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with their own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and when released was nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n==Casting==\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. \"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.\" HarperCollins, 2001. {{ISBN|0-06-093507-3}}</ref> Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.<ref>''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 138</ref>\n\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' featured an ensemble of well-known actors, many of them in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n==Production==\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Cinematographer [[William C.

Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962-1963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor [[David Sheiner]], who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting ''[[Nanook of the North]]''.\"<ref>\"Several hundred volunteers . . braved the elements with shovels, wheelbarrows, bulldozers, and fifty butane flame throwers to remove the snow from the expensive replica of the Holy Land.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 140</ref> Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area \u2013 it was scheduled to become [[Lake Powell]] with the completion of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and the production held up the project.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nStevens brought in two veteran filmmakers. [[Jean Negulesco]] filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets and the Nativity scenes, while [[David Lean]] shot the prologue featuring Herod the Great.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod.<ref>Skal, David J. \"Claude Rains: An Actor\u2019s Voice.\" University Press of Kentucky, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2432-2}}</ref>\n\nBy the time shooting was completed in August 1963, Stevens had amassed six million feet of [[Ultra Panavision 70]] film (about 1829&nbsp;km or 1136 miles, roughly the radius of the Moon). The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to $142 million in 2010) plus additional editing and promotion charges,<ref name=\"Shame p. 142\">''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 142</ref> making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>\"Such giants as ''Cleopatra'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia'' did boast bigger budgets, but they were shot on foreign soil.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\nThe film was advertised on its first run as being shown in [[Cinerama]]. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary and secondary schools. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes and photographs that toured museums around the country.  Promotional items made available to groups identified for [[market segmentation]] included school study guides, children's books and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maresco |first1=Peter A. |title=Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: Market Segmentation, Mass Marketing and Promotion, and the Internet |journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.8.1.002}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' premiered 15 February 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City.

His first introduction to the complexities of the subject was brought about by the work of Fred Barnes and Dr John Bromley from the state Energy Commission of Western Australia.<ref>{{citation\n  |first=J  |last=Joyce\n  |authorlink=John Joyce (car designer)\n  |title=In Search of The Low NO<sub>x</sub>\n  |publisher=Australian Gas Association Conference\n  |date=5 August 1991\n}}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the research and development stretching back over twenty years was about large scale industrial burners and complex mechanisms which, in the end, did not produce what one would consider low NO<sub>x</sub> (2&nbsp;ng/J or ~ 4 ppm at 0% O<sub>2</sub> on [[dry basis]]).<ref>Australian Patent Document No.: AU-B-16047/92</ref>\n\nIn fact at that time, 15&nbsp;ng/J NO<sub>2</sub> appears to have been considered low NO<sub>2</sub>. The one clear message that did flow through all the mass of information he studied, was the effect of [[temperature]] on the formation of NO<sub>x</sub>.\n\n===\"Need is the Mother of Invention\"===\nIn the late 1980s, Health and Environment Authorities in [[Australia]] raised concerns about the [[indoor air quality]] and the extent that particularly older style [[unflued gas heater]]s were contributing to higher than acceptable levels of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>). Consequently in 1989 the [[New South Wales]] Department of School Education initiated an extensive investigation of nitrogen dioxide in schools throughout New South Wales. As an interim measure the Health Authorities advised that a level of 0.3 [[parts per million|ppm]] NO<sub>2</sub> should become the upper limit for classrooms.<ref name=\"A Betts 1992\">S McPhail and A Betts; ''Flueless gas heaters in NSW Government Schools'' Proc 11th Clean Air Conf, Clean Air Soc Aust and New Zealand,5\u201310 July 1992,Brisbane</ref> The [[Australian Gas Association]] in turn reduced the indoor [[air pollutants|emission]] rate of NO<sub>2</sub> for unflued gas heaters from 15 to 5&nbsp;ng/J and this remains the current limit.<ref name=\"AS 4553-2000\" >AS 4553-2000 (AG 103-2000) Gas space heating appliances</ref> The New South Wales government, through the Public Works Department, also re-evaluated alternative methods of heating classrooms, to ensure a safe and healthy environment for students.\n\nIt was in this context, that John Joyce's company [[Bowin Technology]] embarked on a major research & development program aimed at minimising nitrogen dioxide emissions from unflued gas heaters. Bowin Technology set itself the task of solving the emission problem at its source: the [[bunsen burner|gas burner]]. This was despite a generally long held belief by gas experts, that commercially warranted gas burner improvements could not deliver drastic nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) reductions.\n\nIn 1989, an immediate call to reduce the indoor nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) level, was triggered by widely publicised articles and media coverage in New South Wales, highlighting the effect this chemical has on [[respiratory]] sensitive people, such as [[asthma]]tics and those with [[bronchial]] problems.\n\nIn the heat of the indoor air quality debate various State institutions in Australia were advised to switch to flued gas heaters and [[electric heating]].\n\nNew South Wales in contrast, through combined action by [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Health Authorities and the New South Wales Public Works Department, formulated initial indoor air quality guidelines. These guidelines formed the basis for Australian Gas Appliance Code restrictions for nitrogen dioxide NO<sub>2</sub>emissions from unflued heaters, now adopted Australia wide.<ref name=\"AS 4553-2000\" />\n\nJohn Joyce became aware that no other overseas regulatory body made a distinction between NO and NO<sub>2</sub> in their environmental guidelines or codes. Furthermore it appeared that total nitrogen oxides level requirements were in place irrespective of whether emissions were flued or not.\n\nConsequently John Joyce learned that a 'harmless' part of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, [[nitric oxide]] (NO), in the presence of [[hydrocarbon]]s (such as household [[aerosol spray|aerosol propellants]], possible gas leaks and ingress of vehicle exhaust fume), converts to NO<sub>2</sub>. This was found to be the case in the New South Wales school investigation.<ref name=\"A Betts 1992\"/> In a scientific sense it had become practice to calculate both NO + NO<sub>2</sub>, when measuring oxides of nitrogen levels in emissions. Hence the now commonly used reference to \"total NO<sub>x</sub>\".\n\n===Greenhouse gas and photochemical smog===\n[[Natural gas]] by composition has a distinct advantage over other [[fossil fuel]]s in terms of [[carbon dioxide]], [[particulate]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]s produced when converting to useful [[energy]]. In the early 1990s numerous countries were in the process of substituting oil and coal with natural gas for their energy and [[electric power]] needs.\n\nTo maintain this advantage as an \"environmentally friendly\" fuel, Australian gas utilities are effectively reducing gas losses (methane emissions) in their deliveries, and impose strict codes on appliance manufacturers and installers against [[gas leak]]age.\n\nNevertheless environmental experts see the production of oxides of nitrogen as a major menace in the formation of [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[photochemical smog]].  The interaction of [[NOx]] with hydrocarbons from vehicle [[exhaust system|exhausts]] and sunlight, can also form low level [[ozone]]. In the [[stratosphere]] (some 25&nbsp;km up).

His first introduction to the complexities of the subject was brought about by the work of Fred Barnes and Dr John Bromley from the state Energy Commission of Western Australia.<ref>{{citation\n  |first=J  |last=Joyce\n  |authorlink=John Joyce (car designer)\n  |title=In Search of The Low NO<sub>x</sub>\n  |publisher=Australian Gas Association Conference\n  |date=5 August 1991\n}}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the research and development stretching back over twenty years was about large scale industrial burners and complex mechanisms which, in the end, did not produce what one would consider low NO<sub>x</sub> (2&nbsp;ng/J or ~ 4 ppm at 0% O<sub>2</sub> on [[dry basis]]).<ref>Australian Patent Document No.: AU-B-16047/92</ref>\n\nIn fact at that time, 15&nbsp;ng/J NO<sub>2</sub> appears to have been considered low NO<sub>2</sub>. The one clear message that did flow through all the mass of information he studied, was the effect of [[temperature]] on the formation of NO<sub>x</sub>.\n\n===\"Need is the Mother of Invention\"===\nIn the late 1980s, Health and Environment Authorities in [[Australia]] raised concerns about the [[indoor air quality]] and the extent that particularly older style [[unflued gas heater]]s were contributing to higher than acceptable levels of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>). Consequently in 1989 the [[New South Wales]] Department of School Education initiated an extensive investigation of nitrogen dioxide in schools throughout New South Wales. As an interim measure the Health Authorities advised that a level of 0.3 [[parts per million|ppm]] NO<sub>2</sub> should become the upper limit for classrooms.<ref name=\"A Betts 1992\">S McPhail and A Betts; ''Flueless gas heaters in NSW Government Schools'' Proc 11th Clean Air Conf, Clean Air Soc Aust and New Zealand,5\u201310 July 1992,Brisbane</ref> The [[Australian Gas Association]] in turn reduced the indoor [[air pollutants|emission]] rate of NO<sub>2</sub> for unflued gas heaters from 15 to 5&nbsp;ng/J and this remains the current limit.<ref name=\"AS 4553-2000\" >AS 4553-2000 (AG 103-2000) Gas space heating appliances</ref> The New South Wales government, through the Public Works Department, also re-evaluated alternative methods of heating classrooms, to ensure a safe and healthy environment for students.\n\nIt was in this context, that John Joyce's company [[Bowin Technology]] embarked on a major research & development program aimed at minimising nitrogen dioxide emissions from unflued gas heaters. Bowin Technology set itself the task of solving the emission problem at its source: the [[bunsen burner|gas burner]]. This was despite a generally long held belief by gas experts, that commercially warranted gas burner improvements could not deliver drastic nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) reductions.\n\nIn 1989, an immediate call to reduce the indoor nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) level, was triggered by widely publicised articles and media coverage in New South Wales, highlighting the effect this chemical has on [[respiratory]] sensitive people, such as [[asthma]]tics and those with [[bronchial]] problems.\n\nIn the heat of the indoor air quality debate various State institutions in Australia were advised to switch to flued gas heaters and [[electric heating]].\n\nNew South Wales in contrast, through combined action by [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Health Authorities and the New South Wales Public Works Department, formulated initial indoor air quality guidelines. These guidelines formed the basis for Australian Gas Appliance Code restrictions for nitrogen dioxide NO<sub>2</sub>emissions from unflued heaters, now adopted Australia wide.<ref name=\"AS 4553-2000\" />\n\nJohn Joyce became aware that no other overseas regulatory body made a distinction between NO and NO<sub>2</sub> in their environmental guidelines or codes. Furthermore it appeared that total nitrogen oxides level requirements were in place irrespective of whether emissions were flued or not.\n\nConsequently John Joyce learned that a 'harmless' part of NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, [[nitric oxide]] (NO), in the presence of [[hydrocarbon]]s (such as household [[aerosol spray|aerosol propellants]], possible gas leaks and ingress of vehicle exhaust fume), converts to NO<sub>2</sub>. This was found to be the case in the New South Wales school investigation.<ref name=\"A Betts 1992\"/> In a scientific sense it had become practice to calculate both NO + NO<sub>2</sub>, when measuring oxides of nitrogen levels in emissions. Hence the now commonly used reference to \"total NO<sub>x</sub>\".\n\n===Greenhouse gas and photochemical smog===\n[[Natural gas]] by composition has a distinct advantage over other [[fossil fuel]]s in terms of [[carbon dioxide]], [[particulate]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]s produced when converting to useful [[energy]]. In the early 1990s numerous countries were in the process of substituting oil and coal with natural gas for their energy and [[electric power]] needs.\n\nTo maintain this advantage as an \"environmentally friendly\" fuel, Australian gas utilities are effectively reducing gas losses (methane emissions) in their deliveries, and impose strict codes on appliance manufacturers and installers against [[gas leak]]age.\n\nNevertheless environmental experts see the production of oxides of nitrogen as a major menace in the formation of [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[photochemical smog]].  The interaction of [[NOx]] with hydrocarbons from vehicle [[exhaust system|exhausts]] and sunlight, can also form low level [[ozone]]. In the [[stratosphere]] (some 25&nbsp;km up). Ozone is helpful by absorbing the fiercer part of the [[ultraviolet radiation]] of the sun, but at ground level it damages materials and vegetation. It irritates throat, lungs and eyes, and strenuous exercise or work can become painful. Furthermore, the effectiveness of [[nitrous oxide]] as a greenhouse gas is magnified by its longer life than [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and CFC's.\n\nIn essence the rate at which low level ozone is formed is determined by hydrocarbons, whilst the availability of oxides of nitrogen influences the amount it produces.

The screenplay by [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], inspired by [[David Pinner]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Ritual (1967 novel)|Ritual]]'', centres on the visit of Police Sergeant Neil Howie to the isolated island of Summerisle, in search of a missing girl. Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned [[Christianity]] and now practise a form of [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic paganism]]. [[Paul Giovanni]] composed the film score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bac941d|title=The Wicker Man (1973)|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"The Wicker Man 1973\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/95785/The-Wicker-Man/full-credits.html|title=The Wicker Man 1973|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Wicker Man'' is generally well-regarded by critics. Film magazine ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' described it as \"The ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of horror movies\", and in 2004 ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named ''The Wicker Man'' the sixth greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]], the burning Wicker Man scene was No. 45 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]]'', and during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] the film was included as part of a sequence that celebrated British cinema. In 2013, a copy of the original U.S. theatrical version was digitally restored and released.\n\nIn 1989, Shaffer wrote a [[Film treatment|script treatment]] for ''The Loathsome Lambton Worm'', a direct sequel with fantasy elements. Hardy had no interest in the project, and it was never produced. In 2006, an ill-received<ref>''The Wicker Man'' (2006) has a [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wicker_man_2006/ 15% rating] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].</ref> [[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|American remake]] was released, from which Hardy and others involved with the original have dissociated themselves. In 2011, a [[Spiritual successor|spiritual sequel]] directed by Hardy entitled ''[[The Wicker Tree]]'' was released, and featured Lee in a cameo appearance.\n\n==Plot==\nPolice Sergeant Neil Howie journeys to the remote [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, about whom he has received an anonymous letter. Howie, a devout [[Christianity|Christian]], is disturbed to find the Islanders paying homage to the [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Celts|Celtic]] gods of their ancestors. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the [[May Day#Traditional May Day celebrations|May Day celebrations]], teach children of the phallic association of the [[maypole]], and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The Islanders, including Rowan's own mother, appear to be attempting to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.\n\nWhile staying at the [[Green Man]] Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the [[May Queen]]. The photograph of the most recent celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. The landlord's beautiful daughter, Willow,  attempts to seduce Howie, but despite his inner turmoil he refuses her advances. He enters the local school and enquires about Rowan among the students, but all deny her existence. He checks the school register and finds Rowan's name in it. He questions the schoolteacher and she tells him about her burial plot.\n\nAfter seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle, grandson of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Agronomy|agronomist]], to obtain permission for an exhumation. Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in [[Climate of Scotland|Scotland's climate]], and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced pagan religion.\n\nHowie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes; the harvest had failed. His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next harvest will be bountiful. He comes to the conclusion that Rowan is alive and has been chosen for sacrifice. During the May Day celebration, Howie knocks out and ties up the innkeeper so he can steal his costume and mask (that of [[Punch and Judy|Punch]], the fool) and infiltrate the parade. When it seems the villagers are about to sacrifice Rowan, he cuts her free and flees with her into a cave. Exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.\n\nSummerisle tells Howie that Rowan was never the intended sacrifice: Howie himself is. He fits their gods' four requirements: he came of his own free will, has \"the power of a king\" (by representing the Law), is a virgin, and is a fool. Defiant, Howie loudly warns Summerisle and the islanders that the fruit-tree strains are failing permanently and that the villagers will turn on Summerisle and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails as well; Summerisle angrily insists that the sacrifice of the \"willing, king-like, virgin fool\" will be accepted and that the next harvest will not fail. The villagers force Howie inside a giant [[Wicker Man|wicker man statue]] along with various animals, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the [[Middle English]] folk song \"[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]\". Inside the wicker man, a terrified Howie recites [[Psalm 23]], and prays to God before cursing the islanders as he and the animals burn to death. The head of the wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Sgt.

Pinner originally wrote ''Ritual'' as a film treatment for director [[Michael Winner]], who had [[John Hurt]] in mind as a possible star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/trivia.php|title=Wicker Man Trivia|publisher=Wicker-Man.com|accessdate=11 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210205628/http://www.wicker-man.com/trivia.php|archivedate=10 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Winner eventually declined the project, so Pinner's agent convinced him to write ''Ritual'' as a novel instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://b-music-collective.blogspot.com/2011/12/david-pinner-interview-cult-of-david.html|title=David Pinner Interview - The Cult of David Pinner|author=Orphan, David|publisher=B-Music Collective|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner \u00a315,000 for the rights to the novel, and Shaffer set to work on the screenplay.

He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore. He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary. The focus of the film was crystallised when he \"finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice.\" The image of the wicker man, which gave the filmmakers their title, was taken from one sentence in [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|account of his wars]] in what is now France. Caesar claimed that the local tribes there had executed their most serious criminals by burning them alive in a huge man-shaped sculpture of woven twigs. For Shaffer, this was \"the most alarming and imposing image that I had ever seen.\"<ref>Lori Anderson [http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/film/lori-anderson-worship-at-the-feet-of-the-wicker-man-1-3104662 \"Worship at the feet of The Wicker Man\"], ''The Scotsman'', 21 Septemberv 2013</ref> The idea of a confrontation between a modern Christian and a remote, pagan community continued to intrigue Shaffer, who performed painstaking research on paganism.

To convince the [[Trade union|unions]] that he was not about to [[Asset stripping|asset-strip]] the company, Bentley needed to get a film into production quickly. This meant that ''The Wicker Man'', a film set during spring, actually began filming in October 1972: artificial leaves and blossoms had to be glued to trees in many scenes. The production was kept on a small budget.<ref name=\"stevephilips\" /> Christopher Lee was extremely keen to get the film made; he and others worked on the production without pay.{{fact|date=May 2017}}<!-- I think Christopher Lee mentions this on the DVD commentary.

Indeed, according to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary, director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a \"musical\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nComposed, arranged, and recorded by [[Paul Giovanni]], and performed by [[Magnet (band)|Magnet]] (in some versions of the film credited as \"Lodestone\"), the soundtrack contains 13 folk songs performed by characters in the film. Included are traditional songs, original compositions by Giovanni, and even a nursery rhyme, \"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (nursery rhyme)|Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]\".\n\n\"[[Willow's Song]]\" has been covered or sampled by various rock music bands. It was first covered by the English musical project known as [[Nature and Organisation]] on their 1994 release 'Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude'. It was covered by [[Sneaker Pimps]] as \"How Do\", and is included on their 1996 release ''Becoming X''. \"How Do\" can be heard in the movie ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005); the song is incorrectly credited in the end titles as being composed by Sneaker Pimps. Additionally, the band has covered \"Gently Johnny\" as \"Johnny\"; it is featured as a B-side on their single \"Roll On\" (1996). It also was covered by [[Faith and the Muse]] on their 2003 album ''[[The Burning Season (album)|The Burning Season]]'', and [[The Mock Turtles]] on their album ''[[Turtle Soup]]''.\n\nThe songs on the soundtrack were composed or arranged by Giovanni under the direction of Hardy and Shaffer, whose research into the oral folk tradition in England and Scotland was based largely on the work of [[Cecil Sharp]], a 'founding father' of the folk-revival movement of the early 20th century. Using Sharp's collections as a template, Shaffer noted to Giovanni which scenes were to have music, and in some cases provided lyrics which would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=David|date=1977|title=The Wicker Man|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|journal=Cinefantastique|volume=6 |issue=3|pages=22|via=Wayback Machine|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314113156/http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|archivedate=14 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other songs on the soundtrack come from a later folk tradition, for example, \"Corn Riggs\", by Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns, accompanies Howie's arrival on Summerisle.

Corman recommended an additional 13&nbsp;minutes be cut from the film. (Corman did not acquire US release rights, and eventually [[Warner Bros.]] test-marketed the film in drive-ins.) In Britain, the film was ordered reduced to roughly 87&nbsp;minutes, with some narrative restructuring, and released as the [[B-movie|\"B\" picture]] on a double bill with ''[[Don't Look Now]]''. According to Lee, the cuts adversely affected the film's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].\n\n===First restoration===\nDuring the mid-1970s, Hardy made inquiries about the film, hoping to restore it to his original vision. Along with Lee and Shaffer, Hardy searched for his original cut, or raw footage. Both of these appeared to have been lost. Cult film director [[Alex Cox]] said in his ''[[Moviedrome]]'' introduction in 1988 that the negative had \"ended up in the pylons that support the [[M4 motorway (Great Britain)|M4 motorway]].\"<ref name=\"alexcox\">{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Alex |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8IGJjukTzc |title=Moviedrome \u2013 Wicker Man \u2013 Alex Cox intro |work=YouTube |accessdate=20 February 2009}}</ref> Hardy recalled that a copy of the film made prior to Deeley's cuts was sent to Corman, who, it turned out, still had a copy, possibly the only existing print of Hardy's original cut. The US rights had been sold by Warner Bros. to a small firm called Abraxas, managed by film buff Stirling Smith and critic John Alan Simon. Stirling agreed to an American release of a reconstruction by Hardy. Hardy restored the narrative structure, some of the erotic elements which had been excised, and a very brief pre-title segment of Howie on the mainland (appearing at a church with his fianc\u00e9e). A 96-minute restored version was released in January 1979,<ref name=\"stevephilips\">{{cite web | title=The various versions of ''The Wicker Man'' | last=Philips |first=Steve |work=Steve's Web Page |year=2002 |url=http://steve-p.org/wm/ |accessdate=11 December 2006}}</ref> again to critical acclaim.\n\n===US VHS version===\nStrangely, the original 99-minute version was available in the US on VHS home video from Media Home Entertainment (and later Magnum) during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Needs citation|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=September 2017}} This video includes additional early scenes set inside Howie's police station which Hardy had left out of the 1979 restoration.\n\n===Director's cut===\nIn 2001, the film's new world rights owners, [[Canal+ Group|Canal+]], tried to release the full-length film. Corman's copy had been lost but a [[telecine]] transfer to 1-inch videotape existed. Missing elements were combined with film elements from the previous versions (in particular, additional scenes of Howie on the mainland were restored, showing him to be the object of gossip at his police station, establishing his devout religiosity). The extended DVD cut was released by Canal+ ([[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] handling US DVD distribution) in this 95-minute hybrid, considered the longest and closest version to Hardy's original 99-minute version.<ref name=\"stevephilips\" /> A two-disc limited edition set was sold with the shortened theatrical release, the new extended version and a documentary, ''The Wicker Man Enigma''.<ref name=\"wickermanenigma\">{{IMDb title|id=0307667 |title=The Wicker Man Enigma |description=2001 documentary on the film's production and releases. }}</ref> In 2005, ''Inside The Wicker Man'' author Allan Brown revealed he had discovered stills taken on the set showing sequences from the script that had never been seen; it had never been certain that the scenes had been filmed. They include scenes where Howie closes a mainland pub open after hours, encounters a prostitute, has a massage from Willow McGregor and sees a brutal confrontation between Oak and a villager in The Green Man, which were featured in a revised edition of ''Inside The Wicker Man''. Anchor Bay released a limited edition wooden box of ''The Wicker Man''. Fifty thousand two-disc sets were made, of which twenty were signed by Lee and Woodward, Shaffer, Snell and Hardy. In June 2007, Lee discussed the lost original cut, \"I still believe it exists somewhere, in [[film can|cans]] with no name. I still believe that. But nobody's ever seen it since, so we couldn't re-cut it, re-edit it, which was what I wanted to do.

They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the [[May Day#Traditional May Day celebrations|May Day celebrations]], teach children of the phallic association of the [[maypole]], and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The Islanders, including Rowan's own mother, appear to be attempting to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.\n\nWhile staying at the [[Green Man]] Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the [[May Queen]]. The photograph of the most recent celebration is suspiciously missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. The landlord's beautiful daughter, Willow,  attempts to seduce Howie, but despite his inner turmoil he refuses her advances. He enters the local school and enquires about Rowan among the students, but all deny her existence. He checks the school register and finds Rowan's name in it. He questions the schoolteacher and she tells him about her burial plot.\n\nAfter seeing Rowan's burial plot, Howie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle, grandson of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Agronomy|agronomist]], to obtain permission for an exhumation. Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in [[Climate of Scotland|Scotland's climate]], and encouraged the belief that old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island. Over the next several generations, the island's inhabitants fully embraced pagan religion.\n\nHowie finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes; the harvest had failed. His research reveals that when there is a poor harvest, the islanders make a human sacrifice to ensure that the next harvest will be bountiful. He comes to the conclusion that Rowan is alive and has been chosen for sacrifice. During the May Day celebration, Howie knocks out and ties up the innkeeper so he can steal his costume and mask (that of [[Punch and Judy|Punch]], the fool) and infiltrate the parade. When it seems the villagers are about to sacrifice Rowan, he cuts her free and flees with her into a cave. Exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.\n\nSummerisle tells Howie that Rowan was never the intended sacrifice: Howie himself is. He fits their gods' four requirements: he came of his own free will, has \"the power of a king\" (by representing the Law), is a virgin, and is a fool. Defiant, Howie loudly warns Summerisle and the islanders that the fruit-tree strains are failing permanently and that the villagers will turn on Summerisle and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails as well; Summerisle angrily insists that the sacrifice of the \"willing, king-like, virgin fool\" will be accepted and that the next harvest will not fail. The villagers force Howie inside a giant [[Wicker Man|wicker man statue]] along with various animals, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the [[Middle English]] folk song \"[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]\". Inside the wicker man, a terrified Howie recites [[Psalm 23]], and prays to God before cursing the islanders as he and the animals burn to death. The head of the wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Sgt.

Lee wanted to break free of this image and take on more interesting acting roles. The idea for The Wicker Man film began in 1971 when Lee met with screenwriter [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], and they agreed to work together.<ref>[https://www.steve-p.org/wm/ THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE WICKER MAN]</ref> Film director [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]] and [[British Lion Films|British Lion]] head Peter Snell became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centering on \"old religion\", in sharp contrast to the Hammer films they had both seen as horror film fans.<ref>Stephen Applebaum [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-wicker-man-caught-in-the-crossfire-412303.html \"The Wicker Man: Caught in the crossfire\"], ''The Independent'', 18 August 2006</ref>\n\nShaffer read the [[David Pinner]] novel ''[[Ritual (1967 novel)|Ritual]]'', in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the [[ritual murder]] of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project.

He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore. He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary. The focus of the film was crystallised when he \"finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice.\" The image of the wicker man, which gave the filmmakers their title, was taken from one sentence in [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|account of his wars]] in what is now France. Caesar claimed that the local tribes there had executed their most serious criminals by burning them alive in a huge man-shaped sculpture of woven twigs.

Indeed, according to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary, director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a \"musical\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nComposed, arranged, and recorded by [[Paul Giovanni]], and performed by [[Magnet (band)|Magnet]] (in some versions of the film credited as \"Lodestone\"), the soundtrack contains 13 folk songs performed by characters in the film.

It was first covered by the English musical project known as [[Nature and Organisation]] on their 1994 release 'Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude'. It was covered by [[Sneaker Pimps]] as \"How Do\", and is included on their 1996 release ''Becoming X''. \"How Do\" can be heard in the movie ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005); the song is incorrectly credited in the end titles as being composed by Sneaker Pimps. Additionally, the band has covered \"Gently Johnny\" as \"Johnny\"; it is featured as a B-side on their single \"Roll On\" (1996). It also was covered by [[Faith and the Muse]] on their 2003 album ''[[The Burning Season (album)|The Burning Season]]'', and [[The Mock Turtles]] on their album ''[[Turtle Soup]]''.\n\nThe songs on the soundtrack were composed or arranged by Giovanni under the direction of Hardy and Shaffer, whose research into the oral folk tradition in England and Scotland was based largely on the work of [[Cecil Sharp]], a 'founding father' of the folk-revival movement of the early 20th century. Using Sharp's collections as a template, Shaffer noted to Giovanni which scenes were to have music, and in some cases provided lyrics which would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=David|date=1977|title=The Wicker Man|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|journal=Cinefantastique|volume=6 |issue=3|pages=22|via=Wayback Machine|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314113156/http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|archivedate=14 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other songs on the soundtrack come from a later folk tradition, for example, \"Corn Riggs\", by Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns, accompanies Howie's arrival on Summerisle.

According to Lee, the cuts adversely affected the film's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].\n\n===First restoration===\nDuring the mid-1970s, Hardy made inquiries about the film, hoping to restore it to his original vision. Along with Lee and Shaffer, Hardy searched for his original cut, or raw footage. Both of these appeared to have been lost. Cult film director [[Alex Cox]] said in his ''[[Moviedrome]]'' introduction in 1988 that the negative had \"ended up in the pylons that support the [[M4 motorway (Great Britain)|M4 motorway]].\"<ref name=\"alexcox\">{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Alex |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8IGJjukTzc |title=Moviedrome \u2013 Wicker Man \u2013 Alex Cox intro |work=YouTube |accessdate=20 February 2009}}</ref> Hardy recalled that a copy of the film made prior to Deeley's cuts was sent to Corman, who, it turned out, still had a copy, possibly the only existing print of Hardy's original cut. The US rights had been sold by Warner Bros. to a small firm called Abraxas, managed by film buff Stirling Smith and critic John Alan Simon. Stirling agreed to an American release of a reconstruction by Hardy. Hardy restored the narrative structure, some of the erotic elements which had been excised, and a very brief pre-title segment of Howie on the mainland (appearing at a church with his fianc\u00e9e). A 96-minute restored version was released in January 1979,<ref name=\"stevephilips\">{{cite web | title=The various versions of ''The Wicker Man'' | last=Philips |first=Steve |work=Steve's Web Page |year=2002 |url=http://steve-p.org/wm/ |accessdate=11 December 2006}}</ref> again to critical acclaim.\n\n===US VHS version===\nStrangely, the original 99-minute version was available in the US on VHS home video from Media Home Entertainment (and later Magnum) during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Needs citation|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=September 2017}} This video includes additional early scenes set inside Howie's police station which Hardy had left out of the 1979 restoration.\n\n===Director's cut===\nIn 2001, the film's new world rights owners, [[Canal+ Group|Canal+]], tried to release the full-length film.

Missing elements were combined with film elements from the previous versions (in particular, additional scenes of Howie on the mainland were restored, showing him to be the object of gossip at his police station, establishing his devout religiosity). The extended DVD cut was released by Canal+ ([[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] handling US DVD distribution) in this 95-minute hybrid, considered the longest and closest version to Hardy's original 99-minute version.<ref name=\"stevephilips\" /> A two-disc limited edition set was sold with the shortened theatrical release, the new extended version and a documentary, ''The Wicker Man Enigma''.<ref name=\"wickermanenigma\">{{IMDb title|id=0307667 |title=The Wicker Man Enigma |description=2001 documentary on the film's production and releases. }}</ref> In 2005, ''Inside The Wicker Man'' author Allan Brown revealed he had discovered stills taken on the set showing sequences from the script that had never been seen; it had never been certain that the scenes had been filmed.

Anchor Bay released a limited edition wooden box of ''The Wicker Man''. Fifty thousand two-disc sets were made, of which twenty were signed by Lee and Woodward, Shaffer, Snell and Hardy. In June 2007, Lee discussed the lost original cut, \"I still believe it exists somewhere, in [[film can|cans]] with no name. I still believe that.

Bobby approaches Coach Klein of the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs and is hired as the team's water boy. \n\nThe Mud Dogs have lost forty consecutive games, their cheerleaders are alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment due to budget cuts. When the new team teases him, Klein encourages Bobby to stand up for himself. Remembering all the bullying he has put up with over the years, Bobby tackles the team's [[quarterback]], knocking him out. Seeing Boucher's potential, Klein meets with Helen and tries to persuade her to let Bobby play on the team, but she refuses, saying it is too dangerous. \n\nKlein convinces Bobby to play without letting Helen know, seeing that Bobby is eager to attend college. Bobby becomes a feared [[linebacker]], with Klein telling him to visualize his enemies angering him and use the feelings for motivation. The Mud Dogs go on a winning streak. Bobby's newfound fame and confidence also allow him to reconnect with his childhood crush, Vicki Vallencourt, who has been in prison multiple times. Helen forbids Bobby from seeing her, warning him that girls (and basically everything else in pop culture) are \"the devil\". \n\nThe team's success earns it a trip to the annual [[bowl game|Bourbon Bowl]] on [[New Year's Day]] to face the Cougars and Coach Beaulieu. However, Beaulieu and his team crash the Mud Dogs' [[pep rally]] and reveal that Bobby never finished high school since he was [[homeschooled]], and his fake high school transcript makes him ineligible for college and football. The team and fans turn against Bobby, believing him to be a liar and cheater. \n\nCoach Klein convinces NCAA to let Bobby play if he can pass a [[GED]] exam. He apologizes to Bobby and admits to submitting the fake transcript because he was desperate to get even with Beaulieu. Back in 1978 (20 years prior), Klein and Beaulieu used to be assistant coaches at the University of Louisiana. Beaulieu bullied Klein out of his playbook, took credit for his ideas, got promoted to head coach, and then fired Klein. \n\nThe experience drove Klein to a mental breakdown, making him [[writer's block|unable to come up with new plays]]. The story convinces Bobby to help Klein get revenge on Beaulieu and prove himself to everyone. Helen nags Bobby while he is studying for the GED, driving him to finally stand up to her once and for all. He angrily reveals that he has been playing football, going to college, and seeing Vicki, and intends to continue doing so.\n\nBobby passes the exam, but Helen feigns a coma. Feeling he drove his mother to illness, Bobby stays in the hospital with her. Meanwhile, Vicki spreads word of Bobby passing the exam. This leads to a gathering of fans at the hospital who apologize for not supporting him and try to convince him to play. Seeing her son struggling to ignore his calling, Helen ends her fake illness. She tells Bobby his father, Robert Sr., was never in the Peace Corps, and in fact abandoned her while she was four months pregnant with Bobby to have an affair with a voodoo priestess in New Orleans. This led to Helen being constantly afraid that Bobby would leave her too. Deciding to put her son's happiness ahead of her own selfishness, she encourages him to play in the Bourbon Bowl.\n\nArriving at halftime, Bobby finds the Mud Dogs losing, 27\u20130. The team apologize for not treating him with the respect he deserves. With Bobby's help, Coach Klein overcomes his fear of Beaulieu by visualizing him as various things he's not afraid of, and comes up with new plays. The Mud Dogs begin to catch up, unsettling Beaulieu, who resorts to underhanded tactics to save his and the team's honor. Helen helps by sobering up the team's cheerleaders in making coffee, while Vicki fills in for Bobby's usual waterboy duties. The Mud Dogs win the Bourbon Bowl, 30\u201327. Bobby is named the [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], all to the devastation of Beaulieu and the Cougars. Beaulieu even breaks down in tears, embarrassed that his team lost and is presumably fired as head coach. \n\nSome time later, Bobby and Vicki get married. Bobby's father Robert Sr., who has since changed his name to Roberto, makes a surprise appearance to convince Bobby to skip school and go to the NFL so he can share in his son's newfound fame, citing the success of [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Earl Woods|his father]]. He is tackled to the ground by an enraged Helen to the cheers of the attendants. Bobby and Vicki leave to [[Consummation|consummate]] their marriage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Bobby Boucher, Jr.\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Helen \"Mama\" Boucher\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as Coach Klein\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Vicki Vallencourt\n* [[Jerry Reed]] as Coach Red Beaulieu\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Gee Grenouille\n* [[Larry Gilliard Jr.]] as Derek Wallace\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Farmer Fran\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as Lyle Robideaux\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Paco\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Walter\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as The Townie; Schneider reprises this role in Adam Sandler's film of 2000, ''[[Little Nicky]]'', despite being made by [[New Line Cinema]]; in turn, Sandler plays the same townie in Schneider's film ''[[The Animal]]''.\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Jim Simonds\n* Robert Kokol as The Professor\n* [[Frank Coraci]] as Robert \"Roberto\" Boucher, Sr.\n* [[Big Show]] as Captain Insano\n* [[Soon Hee Newbold]] as Mud Dog Cheerleader\n* [[Dan Fouts]] as himself ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] commentator)\n* [[Brent Musburger]] as himself ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] commentator)\n* [[Lynn Swann]] as himself ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] commentator)\n* [[Chris Fowler]] as himself ([[ESPN]] commentator)\n* [[Lee Corso]] as himself ([[ESPN]] commentator)\n* [[Trevor Miller]] as himself\n* Moosie The Cocker Spaniel as herself\n* [[Dan Patrick]] as himself ([[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCenter]]'' commentator)\n* [[Lawrence Taylor]] as himself (LT's Louisiana Lightning Training Football Camp)\n* [[Bill Cowher]] as himself (Pittsburgh Steelers coach)\n* [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] as himself (Miami Dolphins coach)\n* [[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Bini Taylor]] as Rita\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for ''The Waterboy'' came from one of Sandler's [[Saturday Night Live]] characters. Sandler said \"You could compare him to 'Canteen Boy,' whereas he does love water and they both get picked on a lot, but the thing I like the most about this character is just that he is a genuine, good person.\"<ref name=\"tush\">{{cite web |date= November 11, 1998 |author1= Bill Tush |title= CNN - Adam Sandler's latest triumph: 'Waterboy' - November 11, 1998 |url= https://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9811/11/water.boy/index.html |website=CNN |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010529075507/https://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9811/11/water.boy/index.html |archive-date= 2001-05-29 |url-status= dead }}</ref> \n\nWriter Tim Herlihy said the story was intended to invert the formula of his previous films, where Sandler was an extreme character surrounded by regular people. \"With Happy Gilmore, [...] it was a very straight world that he was the disruptive element in. The pressure was all on Adam to be funny as Happy. Whereas this was like a funhouse, crazy version of Southern college football milieu.

The classrooms and gym where Bobby takes the GED are part of [[Stetson University]], also located in DeLand. Stetson's Carlton Student Union building is featured in the scene where Bobby is told his mother has been hospitalized.\n\nThe scenes involving mama's cabin were shot on Lake Louisa, in [[Clermont, Florida]].\n\nCoach Klein's (Henry Winkler's) office was a stage built inside of the [[Florida Army National Guard]] Armory in DeLand, Florida. It is home of Btry B 1st Bn 265th ADA.

Bobby approaches Coach Klein of the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs and is hired as the team's water boy. \n\nThe Mud Dogs have lost forty consecutive games, their cheerleaders are alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment due to budget cuts. When the new team teases him, Klein encourages Bobby to stand up for himself. Remembering all the bullying he has put up with over the years, Bobby tackles the team's [[quarterback]], knocking him out. Seeing Boucher's potential, Klein meets with Helen and tries to persuade her to let Bobby play on the team, but she refuses, saying it is too dangerous. \n\nKlein convinces Bobby to play without letting Helen know, seeing that Bobby is eager to attend college. Bobby becomes a feared [[linebacker]], with Klein telling him to visualize his enemies angering him and use the feelings for motivation. The Mud Dogs go on a winning streak. Bobby's newfound fame and confidence also allow him to reconnect with his childhood crush, Vicki Vallencourt, who has been in prison multiple times. Helen forbids Bobby from seeing her, warning him that girls (and basically everything else in pop culture) are \"the devil\". \n\nThe team's success earns it a trip to the annual [[bowl game|Bourbon Bowl]] on [[New Year's Day]] to face the Cougars and Coach Beaulieu. However, Beaulieu and his team crash the Mud Dogs' [[pep rally]] and reveal that Bobby never finished high school since he was [[homeschooled]], and his fake high school transcript makes him ineligible for college and football. The team and fans turn against Bobby, believing him to be a liar and cheater. \n\nCoach Klein convinces NCAA to let Bobby play if he can pass a [[GED]] exam. He apologizes to Bobby and admits to submitting the fake transcript because he was desperate to get even with Beaulieu. Back in 1978 (20 years prior), Klein and Beaulieu used to be assistant coaches at the University of Louisiana. Beaulieu bullied Klein out of his playbook, took credit for his ideas, got promoted to head coach, and then fired Klein. \n\nThe experience drove Klein to a mental breakdown, making him [[writer's block|unable to come up with new plays]]. The story convinces Bobby to help Klein get revenge on Beaulieu and prove himself to everyone. Helen nags Bobby while he is studying for the GED, driving him to finally stand up to her once and for all. He angrily reveals that he has been playing football, going to college, and seeing Vicki, and intends to continue doing so.\n\nBobby passes the exam, but Helen feigns a coma. Feeling he drove his mother to illness, Bobby stays in the hospital with her. Meanwhile, Vicki spreads word of Bobby passing the exam. This leads to a gathering of fans at the hospital who apologize for not supporting him and try to convince him to play. Seeing her son struggling to ignore his calling, Helen ends her fake illness. She tells Bobby his father, Robert Sr., was never in the Peace Corps, and in fact abandoned her while she was four months pregnant with Bobby to have an affair with a voodoo priestess in New Orleans. This led to Helen being constantly afraid that Bobby would leave her too. Deciding to put her son's happiness ahead of her own selfishness, she encourages him to play in the Bourbon Bowl.\n\nArriving at halftime, Bobby finds the Mud Dogs losing, 27\u20130. The team apologize for not treating him with the respect he deserves. With Bobby's help, Coach Klein overcomes his fear of Beaulieu by visualizing him as various things he's not afraid of, and comes up with new plays. The Mud Dogs begin to catch up, unsettling Beaulieu, who resorts to underhanded tactics to save his and the team's honor. Helen helps by sobering up the team's cheerleaders in making coffee, while Vicki fills in for Bobby's usual waterboy duties. The Mud Dogs win the Bourbon Bowl, 30\u201327. Bobby is named the [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], all to the devastation of Beaulieu and the Cougars. Beaulieu even breaks down in tears, embarrassed that his team lost and is presumably fired as head coach. \n\nSome time later, Bobby and Vicki get married. Bobby's father Robert Sr., who has since changed his name to Roberto, makes a surprise appearance to convince Bobby to skip school and go to the NFL so he can share in his son's newfound fame, citing the success of [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Earl Woods|his father]]. He is tackled to the ground by an enraged Helen to the cheers of the attendants. Bobby and Vicki leave to [[Consummation|consummate]] their marriage.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Bobby Boucher, Jr.\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Helen \"Mama\" Boucher\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as Coach Klein\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Vicki Vallencourt\n* [[Jerry Reed]] as Coach Red Beaulieu\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Gee Grenouille\n* [[Larry Gilliard Jr.]] as Derek Wallace\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Farmer Fran\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as Lyle Robideaux\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Paco\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Walter\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as The Townie; Schneider reprises this role in Adam Sandler's film of 2000, ''[[Little Nicky]]'', despite being made by [[New Line Cinema]]; in turn, Sandler plays the same townie in Schneider's film ''[[The Animal]]''.\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Jim Simonds\n* Robert Kokol as The Professor\n* [[Frank Coraci]] as Robert \"Roberto\" Boucher, Sr.\n* [[Big Show]] as Captain Insano\n* [[Soon Hee Newbold]] as Mud Dog Cheerleader\n* [[Dan Fouts]] as himself ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] commentator)\n* [[Brent Musburger]] as himself ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] commentator)\n* [[Lynn Swann]] as himself ([[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] commentator)\n* [[Chris Fowler]] as himself ([[ESPN]] commentator)\n* [[Lee Corso]] as himself ([[ESPN]] commentator)\n* [[Trevor Miller]] as himself\n* Moosie The Cocker Spaniel as herself\n* [[Dan Patrick]] as himself ([[ESPN]] ''[[SportsCenter]]'' commentator)\n* [[Lawrence Taylor]] as himself (LT's Louisiana Lightning Training Football Camp)\n* [[Bill Cowher]] as himself (Pittsburgh Steelers coach)\n* [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] as himself (Miami Dolphins coach)\n* [[Jennifer Taylor (actress)|Jennifer Bini Taylor]] as Rita\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for ''The Waterboy'' came from one of Sandler's [[Saturday Night Live]] characters.

The pressure was all on Adam to be funny as Happy. Whereas this was like a funhouse, crazy version of Southern college football milieu.

The band was formed in 1981 by guitarists [[Kerry King]] and [[Jeff Hanneman]], drummer [[Dave Lombardo]], and bassist and vocalist [[Tom Araya]]. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \"big four\" bands of [[thrash metal]], alongside [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Slayer's final lineup comprised King, Araya, drummer [[Paul Bostaph]] and guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]]. Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.\n\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as [[murder]], [[serial killer]]s, [[torture]], [[genocide]], [[human subject research|human experimentation]], [[Satanism]], [[hate crime]]s, [[terrorism]], [[religion]], [[antireligion]], [[Nazism]], [[racism]], [[war]] and [[prison]], have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.\n\nSlayer released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] in the United States. The band has received five [[Grammy Award]] nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"[[Eyes of the Insane]]\" and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\", both of which were from the album ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States.

However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.\n\nSlayer released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] in the United States. The band has received five [[Grammy Award]] nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"[[Eyes of the Insane]]\" and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\", both of which were from the album ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' (2006).

It is also connected to the [[Magdeburg S-Bahn]] network and the [[HarzElbeExpress]] regional rail network.\n\n==History ==\nThe current main station is built on the site of the western side of the former Magdeburg Fortress. Several competing railway companies had built lines to Magdeburg between 1839 and 1849, each with their own stations. They were built on the west bank of the [[Elbe]] river, on reclaimed land. With the increasing industrialisation and growing importance of Magdeburg, the need for space at stations grew. A central station, however, was not feasible at first.\n\nAs the existing railway facilities in Magdeburg became more inadequate the construction of a central station became more urgent. Both the city of Magdeburg and various railway companies conducted lengthy negotiations with the military with the objective of buying the grounds of the disused fortress. In 1870, three railway companies, the [[Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway]], the [[Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway]], [[Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway]] finally reached an agreement to buy the 33 hectares of the fortifications from the state of [[Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book | first= Helmut|last= Asmus | title= 1200 Jahre Magdeburg (1200 years of Magdeburg) | volume= 3 | publisher=Scriptum | location=Magdeburg | year =2005 | pages=222\u2013223 |language=German }}</ref>\n\n===Construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00996, Magdeburg, Frontk\u00e4mpfertag.jpg|thumb|left|Former western station building and concourse (January 1925) - now ''K\u00f6lner Platz'']]\nThe foundation stone for the new Magdeburg station was laid in 1870. The companies involved were the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway, the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway, both of which had been strongly affected by the confined spaces of the stations on the banks of the Elbe, and lastly, the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway which was less troubled by its existing infrastructure.\n\nThe companies built two entrance buildings. The Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway constructed the eastern entrance building in the style of a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] palace between 1872 and 1882. Its cladding consists of [[sandstone]] obtained from [[K\u00f6nigslutter]]. The western entrance building was built by the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway and was shared with the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway. In contrast to the eastern building, [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]] sandstone was used for the north facade of the western building, its walls were made of bricks faced with stone. Both buildings were of equal length and connected with each other by separate tunnels for passengers and baggage.\n\nOn 15 May 1873 the first train ran between the new station and the town of [[Burg bei Magdeburg|Burg]]. The official opening took place on 18 August 1873. Construction works continued until 1893. In addition to the passenger station there were also extensive freight facilities.\n \nOn 1 July 1923 the first electric train ran from Zerbst to Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof. Electrification had begun in 1910, but had been interrupted by [[World War I]]. From 7 October 1934 electric trains also ran to Halle.\n\n===Damage in World War II ===\nAs an infrastructure building, the central station was subject of heavy bombing during World War II. On 16 January 1945 the station was hit in a severe air raid on the city. The western station building was completely destroyed and never rebuilt, while the eastern entrance building was heavily damaged and the platform halls were partially collapsed. The tracks were littered with bomb craters and the signal boxes were partially destroyed by the bombing.\n\n===Reconstruction after 1945 ===\n[[File:Zu den Bahnsteigen MD Hbf.JPG|thumb|Entrance hall]]\nAt the end of March 1946, the restoration of the electrification had been completed on the rail networks in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. Then, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military authorities then demanded the removal of the overhead line equipment and the transfer of the electrical rolling stock as [[War reparations|reparations]] to the Soviet Union, which was partly returned in the early 1950s in need of repair. The rail network was then electrified for the third time, and electric train operation resumed in 1956. Reconstructed of the main station started in 1946, but the platform halls were omitted.\n\nIn 1974, the Magdeburg S-Bahn was established. More extensive alterations were made in 1984. After [[German reunification]] in 1992, platforms were lengthened to allow [[Intercity-Express]] operation. In 2003, the pedestrian tunnel was extended to connect the various platforms to an entrance on the western side of the station. The station was modernised again between 2008 and 2015 at a cost of about \u20ac300 million.\n\n==Train services==\nThe following services currently call at the station:<ref>[http://kursbuch.bahn.de/hafas/kbview.exe/dn?st_name=Magdeburg+hbf&st_filter=&cat_name=&searchmode=station&mainframe=result&orig=sS&dosearch=1&oblig_st=1&submitButton=Suche+starten Timetables for Magdeburg Hbf station] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable vatop\"\n!

sometimes translated as '''Magdeburg Central Station''') is the main railway station in the city of [[Magdeburg]] in the northern part of the German state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]].\n\n==Importance ==\nThe station is the main station of Magdeburg and along with [[Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof|Halle Hauptbahnhof]] the centre of long-distance rail transport in Saxony-Anhalt. It is also connected to the [[Magdeburg S-Bahn]] network and the [[HarzElbeExpress]] regional rail network.\n\n==History ==\nThe current main station is built on the site of the western side of the former Magdeburg Fortress. Several competing railway companies had built lines to Magdeburg between 1839 and 1849, each with their own stations. They were built on the west bank of the [[Elbe]] river, on reclaimed land. With the increasing industrialisation and growing importance of Magdeburg, the need for space at stations grew. A central station, however, was not feasible at first.\n\nAs the existing railway facilities in Magdeburg became more inadequate the construction of a central station became more urgent. Both the city of Magdeburg and various railway companies conducted lengthy negotiations with the military with the objective of buying the grounds of the disused fortress. In 1870, three railway companies, the [[Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway]], the [[Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway]], [[Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway]] finally reached an agreement to buy the 33 hectares of the fortifications from the state of [[Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book | first= Helmut|last= Asmus | title= 1200 Jahre Magdeburg (1200 years of Magdeburg) | volume= 3 | publisher=Scriptum | location=Magdeburg | year =2005 | pages=222\u2013223 |language=German }}</ref>\n\n===Construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00996, Magdeburg, Frontk\u00e4mpfertag.jpg|thumb|left|Former western station building and concourse (January 1925) - now ''K\u00f6lner Platz'']]\nThe foundation stone for the new Magdeburg station was laid in 1870. The companies involved were the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway, the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway, both of which had been strongly affected by the confined spaces of the stations on the banks of the Elbe, and lastly, the Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway which was less troubled by its existing infrastructure.\n\nThe companies built two entrance buildings. The Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway constructed the eastern entrance building in the style of a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] palace between 1872 and 1882. Its cladding consists of [[sandstone]] obtained from [[K\u00f6nigslutter]]. The western entrance building was built by the Berlin-Potsdam-Magdeburg Railway and was shared with the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway. In contrast to the eastern building, [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]] sandstone was used for the north facade of the western building, its walls were made of bricks faced with stone. Both buildings were of equal length and connected with each other by separate tunnels for passengers and baggage.\n\nOn 15 May 1873 the first train ran between the new station and the town of [[Burg bei Magdeburg|Burg]]. The official opening took place on 18 August 1873. Construction works continued until 1893. In addition to the passenger station there were also extensive freight facilities.\n \nOn 1 July 1923 the first electric train ran from Zerbst to Magdeburg Hauptbahnhof. Electrification had begun in 1910, but had been interrupted by [[World War I]]. From 7 October 1934 electric trains also ran to Halle.\n\n===Damage in World War II ===\nAs an infrastructure building, the central station was subject of heavy bombing during World War II. On 16 January 1945 the station was hit in a severe air raid on the city. The western station building was completely destroyed and never rebuilt, while the eastern entrance building was heavily damaged and the platform halls were partially collapsed. The tracks were littered with bomb craters and the signal boxes were partially destroyed by the bombing.\n\n===Reconstruction after 1945 ===\n[[File:Zu den Bahnsteigen MD Hbf.JPG|thumb|Entrance hall]]\nAt the end of March 1946, the restoration of the electrification had been completed on the rail networks in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. Then, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military authorities then demanded the removal of the overhead line equipment and the transfer of the electrical rolling stock as [[War reparations|reparations]] to the Soviet Union, which was partly returned in the early 1950s in need of repair. The rail network was then electrified for the third time, and electric train operation resumed in 1956. Reconstructed of the main station started in 1946, but the platform halls were omitted.\n\nIn 1974, the Magdeburg S-Bahn was established. More extensive alterations were made in 1984. After [[German reunification]] in 1992, platforms were lengthened to allow [[Intercity-Express]] operation. In 2003, the pedestrian tunnel was extended to connect the various platforms to an entrance on the western side of the station. The station was modernised again between 2008 and 2015 at a cost of about \u20ac300 million.\n\n==Train services==\nThe following services currently call at the station:<ref>[http://kursbuch.bahn.de/hafas/kbview.exe/dn?st_name=Magdeburg+hbf&st_filter=&cat_name=&searchmode=station&mainframe=result&orig=sS&dosearch=1&oblig_st=1&submitButton=Suche+starten Timetables for Magdeburg Hbf station] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable vatop\"\n!
