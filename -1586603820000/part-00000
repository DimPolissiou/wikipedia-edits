Under heavy pressure \u2014 [[History of Utah|Utah]] would not be accepted as a state if polygamy was practiced \u2014 the church formally and publicly renounced the practice [[1890 Manifesto|in 1890]]. Utah's statehood soon followed. However, plural marriage remains a divisive issue, as despite the official renunciation of 1890, it still has sympathizers, defenders, and semi-secret practitioners.\n\nMore recent criticism has focused on questions of [[#Criticisms of doctrinal changes|historical revisionism]], [[#Views on homosexuality|homophobia]], [[#Racism|racism]],<ref>\"Skin Color in Mormon Scripture and Theology\" {{cite web|url=http://irr.org/mit/pdfs/Skin-Color-&-LDS-Church.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122170912/http://irr.org/mit/pdfs/Skin-Color-%26-LDS-Church.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-22 }}</ref> [[#Sexism|sexist policies]], [[#Finances|inadequate financial disclosure]], and the [[historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]].\n\n==Critics==\nThe LDS Church and Mormonism have attracted criticism from their inception to the present day.

[[Joseph Smith]] founded the movement in [[upstate New York]] in the 1820s. The faith drew its first converts while Smith was dictating the text of the [[Book of Mormon]] from [[golden plates]] which had [[reformed Egyptian]] writing on them which he said he found buried after being directed to their location by the [[Angel Moroni]]. The book described itself as a chronicle of early [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], known as the [[Nephite]]s, portraying them as believing [[Israelite]]s who had a belief in Christ many hundred years before his birth. According to the book, the Nephites are one of four groups (the others being the [[Lamanites]], [[Jaredites]], and [[Mulekites]]) which settled in the [[ancient Americas]]. The Nephites are described as a group of people that descended from or were associated with [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], the son of the prophet [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], who left [[Jerusalem]] at the urging of [[God in Mormonism|God]] c. 600 BC and traveled with his family to the Western Hemisphere, arriving in the Americas c. 589 BC. After the translation was complete, Smith said he returned the golden plates to the Angel Moroni.\n\nA contemporary Mormon view is that these Israelite civilizations rose and fell in [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name=autogenerated2>{{citation |title= Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands |first= Joseph L. |last= Allen |year= 2003 |place= American Fork, Utah |publisher= [[Covenant Communications]] |isbn= 1591562724 |oclc= 54031905 |page= }}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref> Civilizations of their magnitude and duration would be expected to leave extensive archaeological records.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crusading against straw men: an alternative view of alternative archaeologies: response to Holtorf (2005)|first1=Garrett G.|last1=Fagan|first2=Kenneth L.|last2=Feder|date=1 December 2006|journal=World Archaeology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=718\u2013729|doi=10.1080/00438240600963528}}</ref> Several Mesoamerican civilizations did exist in the time period covered by the Book of Mormon, including the [[Olmec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]].

There is also access to the shore of the glacial lake.  The vegetation around the track is open alpine tussock, and as such the track offers clear views of the mountains surrounding the wide valley floor of the Hooker Valley.\n\n==Description==\nThe Hooker Valley Track starts at the White Horse Hill camping ground, which can be reached from [[Mount Cook Village]] by either a {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} sealed road, or a walking track of similar length connecting Mount Cook Village with the camping ground.  The walking track starts near the [[The Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook Village|Hermitage hotel]]. Adjacent to the camping ground, there is a car park, toilets, and a large modern shelter with informative panels.\n\nIn winter, the access road to the White Horse Hill camping ground can sometimes be closed to vehicles following snowfall, but can be walked along from Mount Cook Village to get to the start of the track.  Alternatively, the connecting track from The Hermitage Hotel across the valley to the starting point of Hooker Valley Track is usually passable.\n\nThe start of the Hooker Valley Track leads through open grassland, as it passes close to the Alpine Memorial, a memorial to the mountaineers who have died in the Mount Cook National Park over the years.  The memorial site overlooks the proglacial lake of [[Mueller Glacier]].\n\n[[Image:Footbridge over Hooker River.jpg|left|thumb|Suspension bridge over Hooker River upstream of Mueller Glacier lake]]\nShortly after the memorial site, the track crosses Hooker River downstream of the Mueller Glacier lake on the first of three solidly built large wooden suspension bridges that were upgraded in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hooker Valley Track gets $1.7m upgrade|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/75266652/hooker-valley-track-gets-17m-upgrade|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|author=Sahiban Kanwal|date=18 Dec 2015|accessdate=2016-08-30}}</ref> As the track leads around the moraine wall damming Mueller Glacier lake, it crosses Hooker River again, this time upstream of Mueller Glacier lake.  After this second bridge, the track continues north further into the wide Hooker Valley, gradually revealing an open view towards the peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook, which remain visible for the entire second half of the track.\n\nThe vegetation in this section of the track changes to snow tussock, [[Aciphylla aurea|spear grass]], large mountain daisies, and [[Ranunculus lyallii|Mount Cook Lily]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Aoraki/Mount Cook Education Resource 2010|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/canterbury/aoraki/aoraki-mt-cook-education-resource-colour.pdf|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=2016-08-30}}</ref> All of these alpine plants flower in the summer months between December and February.\n[[Image:Bridge over Stocking Stream with snow.jpg|left|thumb|Bridge over Stocking Stream in winter]]\nAt times, the track leads close to the Hooker River, its water a bluish light grey colour due to the suspended glacial [[rock flour]] in the meltwater.  At Stocking Stream, crossed by the track on a small footbridge, there is the concrete base which is the only remains of a previous hut at this location, as well as two self-composting toilets, the only toilets along the Hooker Valley Track.\n\nNorth of Stocking Stream, the wide flat valley floor becomes swampy and the track continues on a wooden [[boardwalk]] before it reaches the last of the suspension bridges.  The track crosses Hooker River a third time, just below the moraine walls of Hooker Lake.  A short track leads off the main path to small tarn, before the track skirts around the moraine wall as it climbs gently to the height of the moraine wall, reaching a lookout point with picnic tables, overlooking the proglacial Hooker Lake.  From the lookout, a small path leads down to the shore of the lake.[[Image:Icebergs in Hooker Glacier Lake in front of Aoraki Mount Cook.jpg|right|thumb|Icebergs floating in Hooker Lake in summer]]\n\nDuring the summer months, icebergs can be seen floating in the lake, and the lookout also offers views across the lake to the [[glacier terminus|terminus]] of Hooker Glacier.\n\n[[Image:Broken ice on frozen Hooker Glacier Lake in winter.jpg|right|thumb|Frozen lake in winter with broken ice around a small iceberg remnant]]\nIn winter, there can be snow and ice on the track, and the lake regularly freezes over.  The walking track is not cleared of snow, but since it is relatively flat for its whole length and not close to avalanche-prone mountain sides, it presents no danger to walkers of at least average fitness.  The wooden steps between the memorial and the first suspension bridge can become icy and slippery following frosty nights, but may be bypassed by walking through the snow on the side of the steps.\n\nIn the coldest months of the year, it can even be safe to walk onto the ice of the frozen Hooker Lake once the icesheet is thick enough, but care must obviously be taken.  Icebergs that had already been in the lake at the time of freezing are then frozen in place, but the slight movement of these floating icebergs breaks up the ice surrounding them - these areas must be avoided.\n\nBecause the track is exposed, there is no protection from the strong sunlight, and wearing [[sunscreen]] is advised. There are no boat tours on the lake, unlike at the nearby [[Tasman Lake]].\n\nNo permit or fee is required to walk the Hooker Valley Track.  Dogs or bicycles are not allowed on the track.<ref name=\"DOC\" />\n\n== Location ==\n{{kml}}\n{{PoI start}}\n{{PoI|White Horse Hill camping ground|-43.7188|170.0935|NZ-CAN|Large shelter with information panels and toilets, next to car park}}\n{{PoI|Alpine Memorial|-43.7181|170.0971|NZ-CAN|Memorial to mountaineers who died in Mount Cook National Park}}\n{{PoI|Suspension bridge|-43.7158|170.1031|NZ-CAN|Bridge over Hooker River downstream of Mueller Glacier lake}}\n{{PoI|Suspension bridge|-43.7055|170.1000|NZ-CAN|Bridge over Hooker River upstream of Mueller Glacier lake}}\n{{PoI|Stocking Stream shelter|-43.6983|170.0969|NZ-CAN|Remains of shelter (concrete base only) and self-composting toilets}}\n{{PoI|Suspension bridge|-43.6927|170.0985|NZ-CAN|Bridge over Hooker River downstream of Hooker Lake}}\n{{PoI|Hooker Lake lookout|-43.6893|170.1033|NZ-CAN|Lookout point with picnic benches}}\n{{PoI end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hooker Lake]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/aoraki-mount-cook-village-walking-tracks/\n| title=Aoraki/Mount Cook village walking tracks |publisher=Department of Conservation\n}}\n{{coord|-43.6949|170.0968|display=title|region:NZ-CAN_dim:10000|name=Hooker Valley Track - nominal location}}\n{{commons category|Hooker Valley Track}}\n\n[[Category:Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]]\n[[Category:Hiking and tramping tracks in New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox hiking trail\n |name=Hooker Valley Track\n |photo=Stocking Stream Shelter in Hooker Valley in front of Aoraki Mount Cook Range.jpg\n |photo_size=300px\n |caption=Typical view from along the track - an old shelter at Stocking&nbsp;Stream, in front of [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]\n |location=[[Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]], [[New Zealand]]\n |designation=[[Tramping in New Zealand|Walking track]]\n |length={{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}\n |trailheads=White Horse Hill camping ground, [[Hooker Lake]]\n |use=[[Tramping in New Zealand|Tramping]]\n |highest=Hooker Lake {{convert|877|m|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"TOPO\">{{cite web|title=Hooker Valley Track, Canterbury - NZ Topo Map|url=http://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/trck9195/Hooker-Valley-Track/Canterbury|website=NZ Topo Map|publisher=[[Land Information New Zealand]]|accessdate=2016-08-30}}</ref>\n |lowest={{convert|760|m|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"TOPO\" />\n |difficulty=Easy\n |season=All year\n |sights=Wide glacier valleys with tussock vegetation, glaciers and glacier lakes, moraine ridges, clear views of [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]] and other snow-covered peaks (weather permitting)\n |hazards=[[Sunburn]]\n |surface=Fine gravel, well-formed\n |website=[http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/aoraki-mount-cook-village-walking-tracks/ Department of Conservation]\n}}\n\nThe '''Hooker Valley Track''' is the most popular<ref>{{cite news|title=Half a million visitors to Aoraki/Mount Cook tipped as tourism records tumble|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/82606016/half-a-million-visitors-to-aorakimount-cook-tipped-as-tourism-records-tumble|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|author=Liam Cavanagh|date=1 Aug 2016|accessdate=2016-08-30}}</ref> short walking track within the [[Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]] in [[New Zealand]].

The memorial site overlooks the proglacial lake of [[Mueller Glacier]].\n\n[[Image:Footbridge over Hooker River.jpg|left|thumb|Suspension bridge over Hooker River upstream of Mueller Glacier lake]]\nShortly after the memorial site, the track crosses Hooker River downstream of the Mueller Glacier lake on the first of three solidly built large wooden suspension bridges that were upgraded in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hooker Valley Track gets $1.7m upgrade|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/75266652/hooker-valley-track-gets-17m-upgrade|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|author=Sahiban Kanwal|date=18 Dec 2015|accessdate=2016-08-30}}</ref> As the track leads around the moraine wall damming Mueller Glacier lake, it crosses Hooker River again, this time upstream of Mueller Glacier lake.  After this second bridge, the track continues north further into the wide Hooker Valley, gradually revealing an open view towards the peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook, which remain visible for the entire second half of the track.\n\nThe vegetation in this section of the track changes to snow tussock, [[Aciphylla aurea|spear grass]], large mountain daisies, and [[Ranunculus lyallii|Mount Cook Lily]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Aoraki/Mount Cook Education Resource 2010|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/canterbury/aoraki/aoraki-mt-cook-education-resource-colour.pdf|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=2016-08-30}}</ref> All of these alpine plants flower in the summer months between December and February.\n[[Image:Bridge over Stocking Stream with snow.jpg|left|thumb|Bridge over Stocking Stream in winter]]\nAt times, the track leads close to the Hooker River, its water a bluish light grey colour due to the suspended glacial [[rock flour]] in the meltwater.  At Stocking Stream, crossed by the track on a small footbridge, there is the concrete base which is the only remains of a previous hut at this location, as well as two self-composting toilets, the only toilets along the Hooker Valley Track.\n\nNorth of Stocking Stream, the wide flat valley floor becomes swampy and the track continues on a wooden [[boardwalk]] before it reaches the last of the suspension bridges.  The track crosses Hooker River a third time, just below the moraine walls of Hooker Lake.  A short track leads off the main path to small tarn, before the track skirts around the moraine wall as it climbs gently to the height of the moraine wall, reaching a lookout point with picnic tables, overlooking the proglacial Hooker Lake.  From the lookout, a small path leads down to the shore of the lake.[[Image:Icebergs in Hooker Glacier Lake in front of Aoraki Mount Cook.jpg|right|thumb|Icebergs floating in Hooker Lake in summer]]\n\nDuring the summer months, icebergs can be seen floating in the lake, and the lookout also offers views across the lake to the [[glacier terminus|terminus]] of Hooker Glacier.\n\n[[Image:Broken ice on frozen Hooker Glacier Lake in winter.jpg|right|thumb|Frozen lake in winter with broken ice around a small iceberg remnant]]\nIn winter, there can be snow and ice on the track, and the lake regularly freezes over.  The walking track is not cleared of snow, but since it is relatively flat for its whole length and not close to avalanche-prone mountain sides, it presents no danger to walkers of at least average fitness.  The wooden steps between the memorial and the first suspension bridge can become icy and slippery following frosty nights, but may be bypassed by walking through the snow on the side of the steps.\n\nIn the coldest months of the year, it can even be safe to walk onto the ice of the frozen Hooker Lake once the icesheet is thick enough, but care must obviously be taken.  Icebergs that had already been in the lake at the time of freezing are then frozen in place, but the slight movement of these floating icebergs breaks up the ice surrounding them - these areas must be avoided.\n\nBecause the track is exposed, there is no protection from the strong sunlight, and wearing [[sunscreen]] is advised. There are no boat tours on the lake, unlike at the nearby [[Tasman Lake]].\n\nNo permit or fee is required to walk the Hooker Valley Track.  Dogs or bicycles are not allowed on the track.<ref name=\"DOC\" />\n\n== Location ==\n{{kml}}\n{{PoI start}}\n{{PoI|White Horse Hill camping ground|-43.7188|170.0935|NZ-CAN|Large shelter with information panels and toilets, next to car park}}\n{{PoI|Alpine Memorial|-43.7181|170.0971|NZ-CAN|Memorial to mountaineers who died in Mount Cook National Park}}\n{{PoI|Suspension bridge|-43.7158|170.1031|NZ-CAN|Bridge over Hooker River downstream of Mueller Glacier lake}}\n{{PoI|Suspension bridge|-43.7055|170.1000|NZ-CAN|Bridge over Hooker River upstream of Mueller Glacier lake}}\n{{PoI|Stocking Stream shelter|-43.6983|170.0969|NZ-CAN|Remains of shelter (concrete base only) and self-composting toilets}}\n{{PoI|Suspension bridge|-43.6927|170.0985|NZ-CAN|Bridge over Hooker River downstream of Hooker Lake}}\n{{PoI|Hooker Lake lookout|-43.6893|170.1033|NZ-CAN|Lookout point with picnic benches}}\n{{PoI end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hooker Lake]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/aoraki-mount-cook-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/aoraki-mount-cook-village-walking-tracks/\n| title=Aoraki/Mount Cook village walking tracks |publisher=Department of Conservation\n}}\n{{coord|-43.6949|170.0968|display=title|region:NZ-CAN_dim:10000|name=Hooker Valley Track - nominal location}}\n{{commons category|Hooker Valley Track}}\n\n[[Category:Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]]\n[[Category:Hiking and tramping tracks in New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Ntaskos", "label": "safe", "comment": "The previous URL leading to the source was wrongly written, so I have placed the correct one.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooker_Valley_Track"}

It was originally released in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]] for [[MS-DOS]]; this version received an expansion in 1992. The [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] versions were released in 1993, 1994 and 1996 respectively (the PlayStation version was retitled as simply '''''Gunship''''', but was sometimes<ref name=psm/> still referred to as ''Gunship 2000'').\n\n''Gunship 2000'' significantly enhanced and expanded the features and gameplay from the original ''Gunship''. Besides improved audio and graphics, key areas of change were enhanced terrain, the ability to fly multiple helicopter types, and the ability to command a team of helicopters and their crews.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[image:Gunship2000 - Screenshot 1.png|thumb|left|AH-64 Apache ready for take off from a helicopter base in the Middle East theater (DOS)]]\n\n''Gunship 2000'' utilised roughly the same format as most of the other [[MicroProse]] flight simulators of the time: the player had a profile, chose their combat theatre, and either performed single missions or a campaign. The primary similarity was the randomly generated 'primary-secondary' mission types where the player was given a primary mission (destroy a target / pickup or drop off troops or cargo / recon an objective) and a less valuable secondary objective that included the same kind of tasks as a primary. The campaign strung these missions together in a 'tug-of-war' system. Victories advanced the player's side towards victory and harder missions, defeat went the other way (though the missions sometimes got harder too).\n\nInitially the player flies a lone helicopter to complete missions, choosing between [[AH-1 Cobra]], [[AH-64 Apache]], [[OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58D Kiowa Warrior]], [[OH-6 Cayuse|MD 530MG]] and [[UH-60 Blackhawk]]. As the player's rank increased, the [[RAH-66 Comanche]] and the AH-64B Apache Longbow were unlocked (the 'B' designation is due to the game being designed before the Longbow Apache was in service as the 'D' model). Using less powerful helicopters resulted in a higher mission score, though this had to be balanced with the likelihood of having enough fuel/weapons to complete the mission. Realistic tactics such as [[nap-of-the-earth]] flight and 'pop-up' attacks can be employed on account of the reasonably detailed terrain.\n\nPlanning is often an important part of the game: fuel consumption is unrealistically high (to adjust for a limited game world), and the player can rarely lift off with full fuel and the best weapons loaded. Terrain and enemy presence are also to be considered (the intel briefing may often tell the player what to expect near targets). Usually a Forward Arming Refuel Point (FARP) is present in the mission. This is important, as the player may have to refuel or rearm during the course of the mission depending on the density of enemy and distance to objectives.\n\nOn promotion to the rank of [[2nd Lieutenant]], the player may gain control of several other helicopter wingmen whose helicopters can also be configured to the same extent as the player's. Wingmen can remain with the player or be sent off for separate tasks (such as completing the secondary objective), so a great deal of flexibility is present for tactical planning.\n\nThe terrain modelling is much more advanced than in the original ''Gunship'', with desert wadis and twisting ridgelines being well represented (this is very important for simulating helicopter combat, as cover using terrain is one of the primary tactics). The game has two primary theatres: the [[Middle East]] and Europe. Terrain was designed separately for each theatre; for instance, desert really was desert, and not just European farmland painted brown. Visuals in other areas were about on par for the private flight simulator technology at the time (the later PlayStation version of the game features much better graphics, including full textures on all 3D objects). Enemy forces include infantry, vehicles, tanks, anti-aircraft gun and missile systems, and airplanes. Other game objects included moving trains, civilian buildings, and even animals.\n\n==Development==\nThe cockpit graphics were based on photos of actual army helicopters, though switches and buttons with no in-game function were left out to avoid screen clutter.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Behind the Screens|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=86 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1996|page=99}}</ref>\n\n== Expansion ==\nMicroProse released the '''''Gunship 2000: Islands & Ice''''' [[expansion pack]] in 1992. It added two theatres of war ([[Antarctica]] and [[Philippines|The Philippines]]), all previously released patches, and a [[level editor|mission editor]].{{r|walker199301}} Gameplay followed closely on the heels of ''Gunship 2000'', but added unique aspects for the two new theaters as well as a number of additional functions and new player aids, including: in-flight mission changes, air and artillery support, wind and weather (including [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteouts]] and magnetic disturbances in Antarctica), maintenance and weapon system downtimes, improved [[autopilot]], targeting, navigation, and the addition of a [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] mission clock.\n\nOne of the most innovative features was the mission builder. This tool enabled players to create and edit missions of their own design. Every aspect of a typical ''Gunship 2000'' mission was available for use in the mission builder. It also provided a number of shortcut steps to enable players to quickly create new missions without having to, for example, place every defender on the map one-by-one. Players can even export a standard ''Gunship 2000'' mission into the mission builder as a template for editing.

It was originally released in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]] for [[MS-DOS]]; this version received an expansion in 1992. The [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] versions were released in 1993, 1994 and 1996 respectively (the PlayStation version was retitled as simply '''''Gunship''''', but was sometimes<ref name=psm/> still referred to as ''Gunship 2000'').\n\n''Gunship 2000'' significantly enhanced and expanded the features and gameplay from the original ''Gunship''. Besides improved audio and graphics, key areas of change were enhanced terrain, the ability to fly multiple helicopter types, and the ability to command a team of helicopters and their crews.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[image:Gunship2000 - Screenshot 1.png|thumb|left|AH-64 Apache ready for take off from a helicopter base in the Middle East theater (DOS)]]\n\n''Gunship 2000'' utilised roughly the same format as most of the other [[MicroProse]] flight simulators of the time: the player had a profile, chose their combat theatre, and either performed single missions or a campaign. The primary similarity was the randomly generated 'primary-secondary' mission types where the player was given a primary mission (destroy a target / pickup or drop off troops or cargo / recon an objective) and a less valuable secondary objective that included the same kind of tasks as a primary. The campaign strung these missions together in a 'tug-of-war' system. Victories advanced the player's side towards victory and harder missions, defeat went the other way (though the missions sometimes got harder too).\n\nInitially the player flies a lone helicopter to complete missions, choosing between [[AH-1 Cobra]], [[AH-64 Apache]], [[OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58D Kiowa Warrior]], [[OH-6 Cayuse|MD 530MG]] and [[UH-60 Blackhawk]]. As the player's rank increased, the [[RAH-66 Comanche]] and the AH-64B Apache Longbow were unlocked (the 'B' designation is due to the game being designed before the Longbow Apache was in service as the 'D' model). Using less powerful helicopters resulted in a higher mission score, though this had to be balanced with the likelihood of having enough fuel/weapons to complete the mission. Realistic tactics such as [[nap-of-the-earth]] flight and 'pop-up' attacks can be employed on account of the reasonably detailed terrain.\n\nPlanning is often an important part of the game: fuel consumption is unrealistically high (to adjust for a limited game world), and the player can rarely lift off with full fuel and the best weapons loaded. Terrain and enemy presence are also to be considered (the intel briefing may often tell the player what to expect near targets). Usually a Forward Arming Refuel Point (FARP) is present in the mission. This is important, as the player may have to refuel or rearm during the course of the mission depending on the density of enemy and distance to objectives.\n\nOn promotion to the rank of [[2nd Lieutenant]], the player may gain control of several other helicopter wingmen whose helicopters can also be configured to the same extent as the player's. Wingmen can remain with the player or be sent off for separate tasks (such as completing the secondary objective), so a great deal of flexibility is present for tactical planning.\n\nThe terrain modelling is much more advanced than in the original ''Gunship'', with desert wadis and twisting ridgelines being well represented (this is very important for simulating helicopter combat, as cover using terrain is one of the primary tactics). The game has two primary theatres: the [[Middle East]] and Europe. Terrain was designed separately for each theatre; for instance, desert really was desert, and not just European farmland painted brown. Visuals in other areas were about on par for the private flight simulator technology at the time (the later PlayStation version of the game features much better graphics, including full textures on all 3D objects). Enemy forces include infantry, vehicles, tanks, anti-aircraft gun and missile systems, and airplanes. Other game objects included moving trains, civilian buildings, and even animals.\n\n==Development==\nThe cockpit graphics were based on photos of actual army helicopters, though switches and buttons with no in-game function were left out to avoid screen clutter.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Behind the Screens|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=86 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=September 1996|page=99}}</ref>\n\n== Expansion ==\nMicroProse released the '''''Gunship 2000: Islands & Ice''''' [[expansion pack]] in 1992. It added two theatres of war ([[Antarctica]] and [[Philippines|The Philippines]]), all previously released patches, and a [[level editor|mission editor]].{{r|walker199301}} Gameplay followed closely on the heels of ''Gunship 2000'', but added unique aspects for the two new theaters as well as a number of additional functions and new player aids, including: in-flight mission changes, air and artillery support, wind and weather (including [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteouts]] and magnetic disturbances in Antarctica), maintenance and weapon system downtimes, improved [[autopilot]], targeting, navigation, and the addition of a [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] mission clock.\n\nOne of the most innovative features was the mission builder. This tool enabled players to create and edit missions of their own design. Every aspect of a typical ''Gunship 2000'' mission was available for use in the mission builder. It also provided a number of shortcut steps to enable players to quickly create new missions without having to, for example, place every defender on the map one-by-one. Players can even export a standard ''Gunship 2000'' mission into the mission builder as a template for editing.

Lee]] had been expelled at the 1940 Labour party conference.{{sfn|Zavos|1981|p=85}} The culmination of which, a vote was held for the office of party president with a pro-Cracknell and Pro-O'Brien candidate. O'Brien's ally P.J. Dempsy defeated Cracknell man A.J. Gray 137 votes to 60.{{sfn|Zavos|1981|p=88}} Seeing this as a sign of things to come, Cracknell smilingly asked the minutes clerk to remove his name from the leadership ballot.
