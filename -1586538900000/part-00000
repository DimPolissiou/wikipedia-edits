The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

In 1586, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (lit. \"Beggar's Hospice\") was built by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590) and marked the end of the ''Via Giulia''.<ref name=pie7976/> It was built to solve the begging problem in the city and was given a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' which could employ 2,000 people.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome known as the ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred locations. The Florentines,  the Sienese, and the Neapolitans had their churches built in Via Giulia (the [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]], the [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]], and the [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]] respectively),<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the Bolognese ([[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish ([[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English ([[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedish ([[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) churches were built in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extend over the Tiber. In 1613, the ''Fontanone di Ponte Sisto'' (lit. \"The Big Fountain of the Sistine Bridge\") was built on the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the beggars' hospice on Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> It was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now ''Piazza Trilussa''.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century Via Giulia's path was fixed; it ended by the Florentine quarter to the north and the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' to the south.

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI. Pont. Max. ordered to widen the narrow streets of the town after the restoration of the Castel Sant'Angelo'')</ref> [[:File:Via del Pellegrino Inschrift Alexander VI.jpg|(Fig.)]] and the restoration of ''[[Via della Lungara]]'' on the right bank of the [[Tiber]] from [[Ponte Sisto]] to [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]].\n\n===The project of Pope Julius II===\n[[File:Inschrift Julius II. Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

In 1586, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (lit. \"Beggar's Hospice\") was built by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590) and marked the end of the ''Via Giulia''.<ref name=pie7976/> It was built to solve the begging problem in the city and was given a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' which could employ 2,000 people.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome known as the ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred locations. The Florentines,  the Sienese, and the Neapolitans had their churches built in Via Giulia (the [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]], the [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]], and the [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]] respectively),<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the Bolognese ([[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish ([[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English ([[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedish ([[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) churches were built in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extend over the Tiber. In 1613, the ''Fontanone di Ponte Sisto'' (lit. \"The Big Fountain of the Sistine Bridge\") was built on the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the beggars' hospice on Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> It was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now ''Piazza Trilussa''.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century Via Giulia's path was fixed; it ended by the Florentine quarter to the north and the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' to the south.

We brought him into our zone and made him do some grimy shit.\"</blockquote>\n\nChyskillz was picked as the main producer of the album, he produced 16 of 18 songs.

For example, they had a song called \"Phat ('N' All Dat)\". [[Sticky Fingaz]] invented the word \"phat\".

Other than the six unnecessary skits and a couple of throwaway songs that don't hold up to the high standard the group themselves set, \"Bacdafucup\" is a solid debut album for Onyx from beginning to finish.\"\n\nVic Da Rula of Escobar300 gave the album ten out of ten, saying \"...This album is everything that epitomized the East Coast rap scene at the time, Angry, energetic, and in your face. This album is as raw and gritty as it gets. If you don't have it then your missing out!\"\n\nDeedub of Time Is Illmatic said \"Jam Master Jay insisting that Sticky Fingaz be added to Onyx. There is no question that the self-proclaimed \u201cmad author of anguish\u201d is the chief emcee and carries the lyrical load throughout BacDaFucUp.

The album was [[platinum certification|certified Platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] on October 25, 1993. In 1994, the album was nominated as \"Rap/Hip-Hop New Artist\" on [[American Music Awards of 1994]] and won \"Best Rap Album\" on [[1994 Soul Train Music Awards]].\n\nThe album features three the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles \"[[Throw Ya Gunz]]\", \"[[Slam (Onyx song)|Slam]]\" and \"[[Shifftee]]\". The first single, \"Throw Ya Gunz\", became a crossover radio hit. Their breakout single, \"Slam\", which received heavy airplay on both radio and television ([[MTV]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]), leading the song to reach #4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and get Platinum on August 10, 1993.\n\n''Bacdafucup'' is a groundbreaking hip-hop album, that brought to hip-hop [[slamdancing]], the grimy voice and the bald head fashion.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.rapreviews.com/interview/fingaz08.html |title=Sticky Fingaz - RapReviews.com Featured Interview (by Adam Bernard) [June 24, 2008]| website=stickyfingaz.com |access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[Fredro Starr]], [[Big DS]] and Suave (also known as [[Sonny Seeza]]) met [[Jam Master Jay]] in a traffic jam at The Jones Beach GreekFest Festival on July 13, 1991.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiM_tgCJhgw|title=Sonny Seeza Explains Why You Don't See Him With ONYX That Much Anymore| website=youtube.com |access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwNh52K3u34|title=Fredro Starr talks Onyx, Jam Master J & Signing to Def Jam Records| website=youtube.com |access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref> Jay give them about two months to get a demo, but Suave and Big DS they didn't make it to the studio because they were stranded in Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QuOBbFeg0JIC&pg=PA303&hl=ru&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies (by Brian Coleman) - page 305| website=books.google.ru |access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref> So Jeff Harris, the manager of Onyx, asked Fredro to come to the studio with his cousin, Kirk Jones, who would join the group and be known as a group member as \"Sticky Fingaz\" who at the time was doing a solo career under the name Trop and working in the barbershop making a thousand dollars a week cutting high school.

Thus, all Onyx records were lost.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://arena.com/article/onyx-mad-men|title=ONYX: Mad Men| website=arena.com |access-date=2018-08-01}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\"...When I met Jam Master Jay, I told B-Wiz, who was doin\u2019 his thing, sellin\u2019 drugs, goin\u2019 to Baltimore.

When we lost that sound, that was the end.\"</blockquote>\n\nSo the group needed a new music producer. In Brian Coleman's book ''[[Check the Technique]]'' Fredro described how Onyx met their future producer:<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QuOBbFeg0JIC&pg=PA303&hl=ru&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies (by Brian Coleman) - page 305| website=books.google.ru |access-date=2018-08-01}}</ref><blockquote>\"...We met Chyskillz on Jamaica Avenue one day. We was buying weed at the weed spot and Chy was chasing my truck down the street, yelling, 'I got beats!' His stuff back then was jazzy, on some Tribe Called Quest shit, but it was hot. I knew he could put beats together right away. We brought him into our zone and made him do some grimy shit.\"</blockquote>\n\nChyskillz was picked as the main producer of the album, he produced 16 of 18 songs.

But despite this, he basically let Onyx and Chyskillz do their thing. Sticky says of the late great JMJ: \u201cJay was very hands-on, one hundred percent. He was always there in the studio with us.

Onyx talk about the difficulties you face when you live in the ghetto.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.vladtv.com/article/240678/onyx-on-sticky-fingaz-joining-the-group-jam-master-jay-signing-them|title=EXCLUSIVE!

For example, they had a song called \"Phat ('N' All Dat)\". [[Sticky Fingaz]] invented the word \"phat\".

The song signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic. Produced by [[Chyskillz|Chylow Parker]], \"Throw Ya Gunz\" was a success and made it to four ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, including #1 on the [[Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]] for two weeks. The song achieved even greater success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it peaked at #34 on the [[UK Top 40]] in 1993.

The song was about being grimy and having that echo into a myriad of life situations. Produced by [[Chyskillz]] and [[Jam Master Jay]], \"Shifftee\" was not as successful as the first two singles, but it still managed to make to five different ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, peaking at 2 on the [[Rap Songs|Hot Rap Singles]]. The song was sampled by several rap artists including [[Skillz|Mad Skillz]], [[Raekwon]], [[Marco Polo (producer)|Marco Polo]] and [[Noreaga]].\n\nThe fourth single, \"Da Nex Niguz\"/\"Da Nex DingDong\" was released, November 14, 1993.
