When a user sends a message, it first travels to the WhatsApp server where it is stored. Then the server repeatedly requests the receiver to acknowledge receipt of the message. As soon as the message is acknowledged, the server drops the message; it is no longer available in the database of the server. The WhatsApp server keeps the message only for 30 days in its database when it is not delivered (when the receiver is not active on WhatsApp for 30 days).<ref>{{cite web|author = Gaurav Rathee|title =

Michelsen met resistance from Parliament and from politicians within his own cabinet. Members of the Parliament that supported the republic argued that Norway had been fine without a king since the decision to exit the union with Sweden. Minister for Finance [[Gunnar Knudsen]] would rather resign than to go along with Michelsen's plan to give the crown to Prince Carl of Denmark. Prime Minister Michelsen wanted to avoid a referendum if possible.<ref name=\":2\" /> The monarchists in Parliament and the republicans that supported Michelsen and Danish Prince Carl was scared that Norway as a republic would pose as a threat to other European monarchies. The remaining republicans in Parliament did not share this view and suggested a referendum to settle the case.

The king only realised the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]) northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was quashed, but the southern attack successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the [[Tantra]] sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.\n\nHaving learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja to Kediri rebellion, Raden Wijaya tried to return and defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora and Nambi, went to exile to Madura under the protection of the regent Arya Wiraraja, Nambi's father, who then turned to Jayakatwang's side. Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, submitted to Kediri, brokered by Arya Wiraraja and was pardoned by Jayakatwang.

Shi Bi sailed to the estuary of Sedayu, and from there went to a small river called [[Mas River|Kali Mas]] (which is a distributary of [[Brantas River|Brantas]] river).

A Javanese minister blocked the river using boats. The Yuan commanders then made a crescent-shaped encampment at the bank of the river. They instructed the waterborne troops, cavalry and infantry to move forward together, scaring the Javanese minister. The minister abandoned his boats and fled in the night.

This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]] and victory for Singhasari.\n\n==Background==\n[[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the principal khanate of the [[Mongol Empire]], had sent envoys to many states to ask them to put themselves under his protection and pay tribute.

The campaign also has other purpose. According to Kubilai khan himself, if the Mongol forces were able to defeat Java, the other countries around it would submit themselves.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> That way, the Yuan Mongol Dynasty could control the Asian sea trade routes, because of the strategic geographical position of the archipelago in trading.<ref name=\"mpm\" /> \n\nAccording to the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan shi]]'', the history of the Yuan dynasty, 20,000\u201330,000 men were collected from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Huguang]] in Southern [[China]], along with 1,000 ships and enough provisions for a year.<ref>Weatherford (2004), and also Man (2007).</ref> The officers were the [[Mongol]] Shi-bi, the [[Yugur people|Uyghur]] Ike Mese, and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Gaoxing. \n\nMeanwhile, after defeating [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Dharmasraya]] in [[Sumatra]] in 1290, Singhasari became the most powerful kingdom in the region. Kertanegara sent a massive army to Sumatra in this [[Pamalayu]] campaign. However, seizing the opportunity of the lack of army guarding the capital, in 1292 [[Jayakatwang]], the duke of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] (Gelang-gelang), a vassal state of Singhasari, revolted against Kertanegara.

The king only realised the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]) northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was quashed, but the southern attack successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the [[Tantra]] sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.\n\nHaving learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja to Kediri rebellion, Raden Wijaya tried to return and defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora and Nambi, went to exile to Madura under the protection of the regent Arya Wiraraja, Nambi's father, who then turned to Jayakatwang's side. Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, submitted to Kediri, brokered by Arya Wiraraja and was pardoned by Jayakatwang. Wijaya was then given permission to establish a new settlement in Tarik timberland. The new settlement was named [[Majapahit]], which was taken from [[Aegle marmelos|''maja'' fruit]] that had a bitter taste in that timberland (''maja'' is the fruit name and ''pahit'' means bitter).\n\n=== Military composition ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een krijgsman uit Djokja TMnr 60040120.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century studio portrait of a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] warrior with an iron [[kris]]-tipped spear (a ''[[Tombak (spear)|tombak]]'').

Light armor was deemed more suitable in Java than heavy armor, which is a tropical country, as noted by the Khan himself. The Yuan new army's armor rate was only 20%, and the Northern Chinese army's was slightly more. They had a lot of bows, shields and other ballistic weapons. The heavily armored infantry guards behind these were armed with a spear and a heavy axe. Mongolian soldiers also brought horses. [[History of Yuan]] also mentioned the use of [[Gunpowder artillery in the Middle Ages|gunpowder weapons]], in the form of cannon (Chinese: ''[[Hu dun pao|Pao]]'').<ref name=\"yuan\" /> What kind of ships used for the campaign is not mentioned in the Yuanshi, but Worcester estimates that Yuan junks were 11 m (36 ft) in beam and over 30 m (100 ft) long.

This is now believed to be an exaggerated or mistaken number. Modern estimates place the Javanese forces at around the same size as the Mongol army, of around 20,000 to 30,000 men.<ref name=mpm/> Military forces in various parts of Southeast Asia were lightly armored. As is common in Southeast Asia, most of the Javanese forces were composed of temporarily conscripted commoners led by the warrior and noble castes.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> The Javanese navy, however, was more advanced than the Chinese. [[Javanese junk]]s were more than 50 m (164 ft) long, able to carry 500\u20131000 men, and constructed in multiple thick planks that rendered artillery useless.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Majapahit Peradaban Maritim|last=Nugroho|first=Irawan Djoko|publisher=Suluh Nuswantara Bakti|year=2011|isbn=9786029346008|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\nThe Yuan forces departed from the southern port of [[Quanzhou]],<ref name=chengho>{{Citation\n  | last =  Sen \n  | first = Tan Ta \n |author2=Dasheng Chen\n  | title = Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia\n  | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies\n  | date = 2009\n  | location = \n  | pages = 186\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 9789812308375}}</ref> traveled along the coast of [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] [[Dai Viet]] and [[Champa]] along the way to their primary target.

It is known that the Yuan forces stopped at Ko-lan ([[Biliton]]) to plan their strategy. In February 1293, Ike Mese departed first to bring the Emperor's order to Java. The main fleet then sailed to [[Karimunjawa|Karimun Jawa]], and from there sailed to Tuban. As noted in Kidung Panji-Wijayakrama, they probably looted the coastal village of [[Tuban]]. After that, the commanders decided to split the forces into two. The first will advance inland, the second will follow them using boats. Shi Bi sailed to the estuary of Sedayu, and from there went to a small river called [[Mas River|Kali Mas]] (which is a distributary of [[Brantas River|Brantas]] river). Land troops under Gao Xing and Ike Mese, which consist of cavalry and infantry, went to Du-Bing-Zu. Three commanders sailed using fast boats from Sedayu to Majapahit's floating bridge and then joined with the main troops on the way to Kali Mas river.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|112}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|22}}\n\n[[File:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of a 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]].

According to the Yuan-shi, Wijaya attacked Jayakatwang without success when he heard of the arrival of the Yuan navy. Then he requested their aid. In return, Yuan generals demanded his submission to their emperor, and he gave it.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|113}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nOn the 1 March, all of the troops gathered in Kali Mas. At the headwaters of the river was the palace of [[Tumapel]] ([[Singhasari]]) king. This river was the entryway to Java, and here they decided to battle. A Javanese minister blocked the river using boats. The Yuan commanders then made a crescent-shaped encampment at the bank of the river. They instructed the waterborne troops, cavalry and infantry to move forward together, scaring the Javanese minister. The minister abandoned his boats and fled in the night. More than 100 large boats used to block the river were seized by Yuan forces.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nA large portion of the army was tasked to guard the estuary of Kali Mas, meanwhile, the main troops advanced.
