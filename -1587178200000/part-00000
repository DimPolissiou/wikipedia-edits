{"title_page": "Center (basketball)", "text_new": "{{short description|Position in basketball}}\n[[Image:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|Center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] doing his signature move, the sky hook.]]\nThe '''center''' ('''C'''), also known as the five position, or the big man, is one of the five [[Basketball position|positions]] in a [[basketball]] game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the [[NBA]], the center is usually {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m}} or taller and usually weighs {{convert|240|lb|kg}} or more. They traditionally have played close to the basket in the [[low post]]. \n\nCenters are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[George Mikan]] and [[Bill Russell]] were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a [[three-point field goal]] for the [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380 season]], however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished.<ref>{{cite book |first=Kirk |last=Goldsberry |title=SprawlBall: A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yaDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183 }}</ref> A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as a ''stretch five''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Dan|title=Five out: NBA entering era of 3-point-shooting centers|date=April 17, 2017|work=Pro Basketball Talk|url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/04/17/five-out-nba-entering-era-of-3-point-shooting-centers/|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History of the center position==\n===Emergence of the center and the era of George Mikan===\n[[File:GeorgeMikan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Mikan]]\nThe center is considered a necessary component for a successful team, especially in professional leagues such as the NBA. Great centers have been the foundation for most of the dynasties in both the NBA and NCAA. Until the 1940s, even dominant centers such as [[Moose Krause]] were not extraordinary tall. Then, the {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|2|abbr=on}} [[George Mikan]] and the {{convert|7|ft|0|in|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Bob Kurland]] pioneered as exceptionally tall centers, shattering the widely held perception that tall players could not develop the agility and coordination to play basketball well, and ushering in the role of the dominant big man. While Kurland never played professional basketball after his time at [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]], Mikan turned professional in 1946 after leading [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] to the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] title. He went on to win seven [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], [[Basketball Association of America]] and [[NBA Championship]]s in his ten-year career (1946\u201356), nine of them with the [[Minneapolis Lakers]]. Using his height to dominate opposing players, Mikan invented the [[hook shot]] and the [[block (basketball)|shot block]]; as a consequence, the NCAA, and later NBA, adopted the [[goaltending]] rule, and, in 1951, the NBA widened the foul lane, a decision known as the 'Mikan rule'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html|title=NBA.com: George Mikan vs. The Knicks|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2007-06-25|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67qhnZHXS?url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html#|archive-date=2012-05-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Centers in the 1960s: The era of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bill Russell (left) and Wilt Chamberlain (right)]]\nIn the 1960s, [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] further transformed basketball by combining height with a greater level of athleticism than previous centers. Following the retirement of [[George Mikan]], the rivalry of the two big men came to dominate the NBA. Between the two of them, Chamberlain and Russell won nine of the eleven [[NBA Most Valuable Player|MVP]] awards in the eleven-year period between 1958 and 1969; played against one another in six Eastern Conference Finals and two NBA Finals between 1959 and 1969. Many of the records set by these two players have endured today. Most notably, Chamberlain and Russell hold [[List of National Basketball Association top individual rebounding season averages|the top eighteen season averages for rebounds]].\n\n[[Bill Russell]] led the [[San Francisco Dons|University of San Francisco]] to two consecutive [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA championship]]s (1955, 56). He joined the [[Boston Celtics]] and helped make them one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history, winning eleven championships over his thirteen-year career (1956\u201369) as well as five MVP awards. Russell revolutionized defensive strategy with his shot-blocking, rebounding and physical [[man-to-man defense]]. While he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, much of the team's scoring came when Russell grabbed defensive rebounds and initiated [[fast break]]s with precision outlet passes, primarily to [[point guard]] [[Bob Cousy]].  As the NBA's first African-American superstar, Russell struggled throughout his career with the racism he encountered from fans in [[Boston]], particularly after the 1966\u201367 season, when he became the first African-American in any major sport to be named [[player-coach]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonsportsreview.com/200707_story_cover.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009064738/http://www.bostonsportsreview.com/200707_story_cover.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nHis principal rival, [[Wilt Chamberlain]], listed at 7'1\" (2.15 m), 275 pounds (124&nbsp;kg), lacked Russell's supporting cast. Chamberlain played college ball for the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas Jayhawks]], leading them to the 1957 title game against the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. Although the Jayhawks lost by one point in triple overtime, Chamberlain was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Briefly a member of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] before joining the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] of the NBA in 1959, Chamberlain won two Championships, in 1967 with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and 1972 with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], although his teams were repeatedly defeated by the Celtics in the Eastern Conference and NBA Finals. He also won seven scoring titles, eleven rebounding titles, and four regular season [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] awards, including the distinction, in 1960, of being the first rookie to receive the award. Stronger than any player of his era, he was usually capable of scoring and rebounding at will. Although he was the target of constant double- and triple-teaming, as well as fouling tactics designed to take advantage of his poor free-throw shooting, he set a number of records that have never been broken. Most notably, Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average more than 50 points in a season and [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|score 100 points in a single game]] (both in 1961\u201362 as a member of the [[Philadelphia Warriors]]). He also holds the NBA's all-time records for rebounding average (27.2), rebounds in a single game (55),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19611962.html|title=NBA.com: Wilt Scores 100, Averages 50|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221152005/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19611962.html|archive-date=21 February 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders|career rebounds]] (23,924).\n\nA lesser-known center of the era was [[Nate Thurmond]], who initially played the forward position opposite [[Wilt Chamberlain]] for the [[San Francisco Warriors]] but moved to center after Chamberlain was traded to the new Philadelphia franchise. Although he never won a Championship, Thurmond was known as the best [[pick and roll|screen]] setter in the league, and his averages of 21.3 and 22.0 rebounds per game in 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368, are exceeded only by Chamberlain and Russell.\n\n===Centers in the 1970s and 1980s: The era of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar===\n[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]\nIn contrast to the Celtics dynasty of the 1960s, the 1970s were a decade of parity in the NBA, with eight different champions and no back-to-back winners. At the college level, the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]], under Coach [[John Wooden]], built the greatest dynasty in NCAA basketball history, winning seven consecutive titles between 1967 and 1973. UCLA had already won two consecutive titles in 1964 and 1965 with teams that pressed and emphasized guard play.  After not winning in 1966, Wooden's teams changed their style when [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] became eligible.  He led UCLA to three championships-in 1967, '68 and '69-while winning the first [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] Award. During his college career, the NCAA enacted a ban on dunking primarily because of Alcindor's dominant use of the shot.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836963,00.html | work=Time | title=Basketball: Lew's Still Loose | date=1967-04-14 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> His entrance into the NBA with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in 1969 was timely, as Bill Russell had just retired and Wilt Chamberlain was 33 years old and increasingly plagued by injuries. After leading the Bucks to the 1971 NBA championship, teamed up with legendary [[point guard]] [[Oscar Robertson]], Alcindor, who had converted to [[Islam]], changed his name to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. In 1975, Abdul-Jabbar was traded to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and, after the arrival of [[Point guard]] [[Magic Johnson]] in 1980, formed part of a new Lakers dynasty that won five NBA titles (1980, '82, '85, '87, '88). In addition, Abdul-Jabbar won six regular-season MVP awards (1971, '72, '74, '76, '77, '80). At 7'2\" (2.18 m), 235 pounds (106&nbsp;kg), he lacked the strength of Chamberlain in his prime, but had a longer wingspan and ultimately proved more durable, adhering to a strict physical-fitness regime that enabled him to play for twenty years, the longest career in NBA history at the time. Offensively, he was best known for his trademark 'Skyhook' hook-shot, almost impossible to block because of his height and wingspan. His career record of 38,387 points has yet to be broken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/abduljabbar_bio.html|title=NBA.com: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bio|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Defensively, the 1973\u201374 season was the first in which the number of blocked shots were kept, and, over the next seven years, Kareem led the league in this statistic or finished second.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Stats - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother product of John Wooden's UCLA program, [[Bill Walton]], appeared poised to join the ranks of great centers. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, he also led the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] to the NBA championship in 1977, and won the NBA MVP the following year. However, his career was plagued with injuries, most infamously a broken bone in his left foot suffered during his MVP season that he never fully recovered from, and he spent most of the following decade on the bench, although he eventually did win a second NBA title as a backup for the [[Boston Celtics]] in 1986, when he received the [[NBA Sixth Man Award|Sixth Man Award]]. [[Willis Reed]] won two championships with the [[New York Knicks]] in 1970 and 1973, teamed with Point guard [[Walt Frazier]]; although undersized for the center position at 6'9\", he had the strength to play inside, was a highly skilled jump shooter and was effective at setting [[pick and roll|pick]]s, a key element in the Knicks motion-oriented offense. The undersized but scrappy [[Dave Cowens]], drafted at the recommendation of Bill Russell, helped the [[Boston Celtics]] win two more NBA titles, in 1974 and 1976.\n\nLeading centers of the late 1970s and early 1980s include [[Wes Unseld]] of the [[Washington Wizards|Baltimore/Washington Bullets]], [[Artis Gilmore]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] [[Kentucky Colonels]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]]; [[Moses Malone]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Philadelphia 76ers]]; and [[Robert Parish]] of the [[Boston Celtics]], who was acquired from the [[Golden State Warriors]] in [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980]] for the top overall pick in the NBA Draft. Unseld led the Bullets to four NBA finals appearances and one championship, in 1978. Using his strength and determination to compensate for his lack of size (6'7\", i.e. 2.00 m), he was famous for his rebounding, shotblocking, and bone-jarring picks. [[Artis Gilmore]], often overlooked because of the mediocrity of his teams, established himself as the best low-post scorer in the league. He set the NCAA Division I record for career average in rebounds (25.2) at tiny [[Jacksonville University]], and enjoyed an illustrious [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] career before joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1976, playing there until he was traded to San Antonio in 1982, for whom he played until his retirement in 1987. He remains the NBA's career leader in field goal percentage (minimum 2000 shots made) with a 59.9 percentage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/gilmore_summary.html|title=NBA.com: Artis Gilmore Summary|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Malone, the first high school player to turn professional, was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] after several years in the ABA, and won two MVP Awards and led Houston to its first NBA Finals in 1981, before joining the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], where, teamed with [[Julius Erving]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]], he won an NBA Championship in 1983, as well as a third League MVP. Never a dominant defender, his quickness and tenacity made him one of the best rebounders in NBA history, particularly on the offensive end; he led the league in rebounds six times in a seven-year period and still holds the NBA record for offensive rebounds.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the 7'4\" (2.23 m) Eaton was the most prolific shot-blocker in the league, and, although never a major offensive contributor, won two [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s while helping transform the lowly [[Utah Jazz]] into a playoff contender. Of all these players, none enjoyed the success of [[Robert Parish]], who, with forwards [[Larry Bird]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], formed the legendary frontcourt of the [[Boston Celtics]] team that won three titles (1981, 1984 and 1986). The Celtics' fierce rivalry with the Lakers dominated the NBA during the decade and helped basketball reach an unprecedented level of popularity. Nicknamed \"Chief\" after a character in the film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' because of his stoic demeanor, Parish was known for his trademark arching jump-shot\u2014leading many experts to consider him the best medium-range shooting center of all time{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\u2014and his ability to finish fast-breaks with his surprising speed. Playing until the age of 43, Parish broke Abdul-Jabbar's record for career games played.\n\nThe [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380 season]] saw the introduction of the [[three-point field goal|three-point shot]]. While the concept of the 'stretch five' would not come until the new millennium, one of the first proponents of the position was [[Bill Laimbeer]]. Though he was better known for his brute physical style of play with the 'Bad Boys' [[Detroit Pistons]], Laimbeer also possessed a reliable three-point shot, hitting 33% from long range in his career.\n\n===Centers in the 1990s: Olajuwon, Ewing, and Robinson===\n[[File:Hakeemsigningautocropped.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hakeem Olajuwon]]\nCoach [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]], once a seldom-used backup to [[Bill Russell]] with the Celtics, developed the [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown Hoyas]] into a chief pipeline for talent at the Center position, producing a succession of great defensive big men in [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Dikembe Mutombo]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]]. In 1984, Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, defeated the [[University of Houston]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], to win the NCAA championship. The number one picks in the [[1984 NBA draft|1984]], [[1985 NBA draft|1985]], and [[1987 NBA draft|1987]] NBA Drafts would all be used on centers who made major impacts in the NBA of the 1990s and eventually became members of the Basketball Hall of Fame: Olajuwon in 1984, Ewing in 1985, and [[Navy Midshipmen men's basketball|Navy's]] [[David Robinson]] in 1987. \n\nThe [[Nigeria]]n-born Olajuwon was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] and paired with [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Ralph Sampson]] in what was dubbed the 'Twin Towers' duo. In his second season, 1985\u201386, the Rockets upset the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. Olajuwon established himself as a dominant player, leading the Rockets to two consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. In the 1993\u201394 season he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP), [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], and [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]] awards in the same season. Defensively Olajuwon broke Abdul-Jabbar's career record for blocked shots. Offensively, he was best known for his 'Dream Shake', a series of fakes and spin moves regarded as the pinnacle of big man footwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/program_olajuwon.html|title=It Was All A Dream|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213021343/http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/program_olajuwon.html|archive-date=13 December 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEwing, from [[Jamaica]] by way of the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]], was drafted by the [[New York Knicks]] in 1985, with whom he spent fifteen of his seventeen seasons in the NBA. An eleven-time All Star, Ewing was one of the best shooting centers in NBA history, possessing a baseline jump-shot, as well as being a formidable shot blocker and rebounder. The Knicks were formidable opponents of the [[Chicago Bulls]] dynasty in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Ewing's successor as the starting center at Georgetown, [[Dikembe Mutombo]], who played most of his NBA career with the [[Denver Nuggets]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] proved a dominant defender. Mutombo, who had not played basketball before arriving in the U.S. from his native [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] on a [[USAID]] scholarship, was among the greatest shot blockers in NBA history, leading the NBA in blocked-shots five consecutive years, in the course of a career in which he ranked second in the history of the league in blocked shots, behind only Hakeem Olajuwon. He was also the recipient of four [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s, tied for the record with [[Ben Wallace]].\n\nThe [[1992 NBA draft]] marked the entrance into the league of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], who was drafted by the [[Orlando Magic]]. Immediately drawing comparisons to Wilt Chamberlain, the 7'1\" (2.15 m), 325-pound (147&nbsp;kg) O'Neal was billed as potentially the most physically dominating player ever. By his third season, he led the league in scoring and led the Magic to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the [[Houston Rockets]]. After the 1995\u201396 season, he signed with the rebuilding [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Former Georgetown center [[Alonzo Mourning]], also drafted in 1992, established himself as a premier big man with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] and, later, the [[Miami Heat]], winning two Defensive Player of the Year Awards thanks to his prolific shot blocking while also proving a reliable scoring threat.\n\n===Centers in the 2000s: The era of Shaquille O'Neal===\n[[File:Lipofsky Shaquille O'Neal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Shaquille O'Neal]]\nThe balance of power shifted to the Western Conference, and the NBA was dominated by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who won titles in 2000, '01, '02, '09, and '10, and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who won in '99, '03, '05, '07 and '14. The Lakers hired former Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] thrived in Jackson's [[triangle offense]]. The [[San Antonio Spurs]] were initially led by the 'Twin Towers' tandem of center [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Tim Duncan]]. With the arrival of Duncan, the veteran Robinson modified his game by playing primarily in the high post to accommodate Duncan's strengths as a low-post scorer and defender.\n\nIn the 1990s, an increasing number of smaller forwards, most notably [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Charles Barkley]], excelled at the traditional center functions of rebounding, shot-blocking and low-post defense, anticipating a trend towards relying on shorter and quicker post players that has continued into the 2000s, as exemplified by perennial Defensive Players of the Year [[Ben Wallace]]. In the [[fast break]] oriented style of offense employed by a growing number of teams, the traditional role of the center is diminished, if not done away with altogether. Many talented big men choose to play the more versatile [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position, giving them more room to run the floor and play outside the paint. Under the influence of European basketball, the offensive role of big men has been redefined to include more emphasis on perimeter play, as exemplified by 3-point shooting big men like [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Mehmet Okur]], [[Andrea Bargnani]] and [[Channing Frye]].\n\nThe {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|2}} [[Yao Ming]] was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] with tremendous hype in 2002. Yao proved to be a highly efficient rebounder and scorer, particularly with his mid-range jump shot, and showed the potential to be an elite defender. However, he would retire in 2011 due to a string of foot injuries that caused him to miss all but five games in his final two NBA seasons. Another heralded young prospect, [[Dwight Howard]], has used his exceptional vertical leap to become one of the top rebounders in the NBA.\n\n===Centers in the 2010s: The rise of \"stretch five\"===\nThe low-post functions of the center position continued to dwindle in the 2010s as the NBA embraced [[small ball (basketball)|small ball]] and a more perimeter-oriented style of play. While there are still a few centers that play a more traditional style, some centers begin to adapt to the outside game.\n[[File:Dwight Howard.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Dwight Howard]]]]\n\nThe [[Miami Heat]], for example, featured a \"positionless\" lineup as coined by head coach [[Erik Spoelstra]], with power forwards [[Chris Bosh]] and [[Udonis Haslem]] shifting between center and power forward depending on matchups. The Heat won two NBA championships in {{nbafy|2012}} and {{nbafy|2013}} using this unconventional lineup.\n\nThe [[Golden State Warriors]] then won three championships in {{nbafy|2015}}, {{nbafy|2017}} and {{nbafy|2018}} with a smaller and quicker group known as the [[Death Lineup]]. In this case, 6'7\" forward [[Draymond Green]] was often slotted into the center position, creating matchup problems for larger centers with his defensive versatility, speed, ball-handling skills, and perimeter shooting.\n\nThe rise of the stretch five paved the way for centers to add outside shooting to their arsenal. While they continue to roam the paint at times, they have also expanded their game to the perimeter with their three-point shots.\n\nAnother byproduct of the small ball revolution is the emergence of so-called \"unicorns\", or big men who possess guard-like skills. An example of a \"unicorn\" is [[Nikola Joki\u0107]], whose passing ability for a player his size made the Denver Nuggets contenders in the late 2010s.\n\n==Centers in women's basketball==\nIn women's basketball, 7'0\" (2.13 m) [[Iuliana Semenova]] played the center position, helping the Soviet Union women's team win two Olympic Gold medals, in 1976 and 1980, and never losing a game in international competition. Semenova also led her club team, TTT [[Riga]] to fifteen European Champion's Cup titles. The 6'8\" (2.03 m) [[Anne Donovan]] led the [[Old Dominion University]] Lady Monarchs to the 1979 [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] championship, and was the first female [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] recipient in 1983, before enjoying a successful professional career in Japan and Italy.\n[[File:Margo_Dydek_1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Margo Dydek]]]]\nWith the formation of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], [[Lisa Leslie]] established herself as the premier center, and the league's most popular player. The first WNBA player to reach the 3,000 point milestone, she led the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] to consecutive titles in 2001 and 2002, and holds the distinction of being the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. Other prominent centers in women's basketball include Australian [[Lauren Jackson]] of the [[Seattle Storm]] and [[Karl Malone]]'s daughter [[Cheryl Ford]] of the [[Detroit Shock]]. Jackson can also be considered a [[forward-center]] because she is also a very good outside shooter, leading the WNBA in three-point shooting percentage in one season. [[Rebecca Lobo]] led the [[Connecticut Huskies]] to a [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship]] in 1995, but never recovered from a [[anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] and had a disappointing professional career. When at the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Courtney Paris]] was considered the next dominant female center after becoming the only NCAA player, male or female, to score 700 points, grab 500 rebounds and block 100 shots in a single season; however, she had a disappointing WNBA career and was waived before what would have been the start of her second season in 2010.  The tallest center in the WNBA, the late [[Margo Dydek]] of Poland, who stood 7'2\", is still the league's career leader in blocks per game (2.72) and total blocks (877), solidly ahead of Leslie in that category despite Dydek having played 40 fewer games before retiring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics: All-time leaders: Blocks|url=http://www.wnba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersBPGQuery.html?topic=0&stat=14|website=Wnba.com|accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref> Perhaps the most highly touted center in the women's game in decades, if not in history, is current [[Phoenix Mercury]] superstar [[Brittney Griner]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Basketball centers}}\n* {{cite book |first=Kirk |last=Goldsberry |authorlink=Kirk Goldsberry |chapter=What a Time to Be a Five |title=SprawlBall: A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2019 |pages=178\u2013189 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yaDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA178 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Heisler |first=Mark |title=Giants: The 25 Greatest Centers of All Time |year=2003 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=Chicago |isbn=1-57243-577-1}}\n\n{{Basketball Positions}}\n\n[[Category:Basketball positions]]\n[[Category:Basketball terminology]]\n[[Category:Centers (basketball)| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Position in basketball}}\n[[Image:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|Center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] doing his signature move, the sky hook.]]\nThe '''center''' ('''C'''), also known as the five position, or the big man, is one of the five [[Basketball position|positions]] in a [[basketball]] game. The center is normally the tallest player on the team, and often has a great deal of strength and body mass as well. In the [[NBA]], the center is usually {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m}} or taller and usually weighs {{convert|240|lb|kg}} or more. They traditionally have played close to the basket in the [[low post]]. \n\nCenters are valued for their ability to protect their own goal while scoring with high efficiency. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[George Mikan]] and [[Bill Russell]] were centerpieces of championship dynasties and defined early prototypical centers. With the addition of a [[three-point field goal]] for the [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380 season]], however, NBA basketball gradually became more perimeter-oriented and saw the importance of the center position diminished.<ref>{{cite book |first=Kirk |last=Goldsberry |title=SprawlBall: A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yaDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA183 }}</ref> A center with the ability to shoot outside from three-point range is known as stretch five.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Dan|title=Five out: NBA entering era of 3-point-shooting centers|date=April 17, 2017|work=Pro Basketball Talk|url=https://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/04/17/five-out-nba-entering-era-of-3-point-shooting-centers/|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History of the center position==\n===Emergence of the center and the era of George Mikan===\n[[File:GeorgeMikan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Mikan]]\nThe center is considered a necessary component for a successful team, especially in professional leagues such as the NBA. Great centers have been the foundation for most of the dynasties in both the NBA and NCAA. Until the 1940s, even dominant centers such as [[Moose Krause]] were not extraordinary tall. Then, the {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m|2|abbr=on}} [[George Mikan]] and the {{convert|7|ft|0|in|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Bob Kurland]] pioneered as exceptionally tall centers, shattering the widely held perception that tall players could not develop the agility and coordination to play basketball well, and ushering in the role of the dominant big man. While Kurland never played professional basketball after his time at [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]], Mikan turned professional in 1946 after leading [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] to the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] title. He went on to win seven [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]], [[Basketball Association of America]] and [[NBA Championship]]s in his ten-year career (1946\u201356), nine of them with the [[Minneapolis Lakers]]. Using his height to dominate opposing players, Mikan invented the [[hook shot]] and the [[block (basketball)|shot block]]; as a consequence, the NCAA, and later NBA, adopted the [[goaltending]] rule, and, in 1951, the NBA widened the foul lane, a decision known as the 'Mikan rule'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html|title=NBA.com: George Mikan vs. The Knicks|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2007-06-25|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67qhnZHXS?url=http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Mikan_v_Knicks.html#|archive-date=2012-05-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Centers in the 1960s: The era of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain Bill Russell.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bill Russell (left) and Wilt Chamberlain (right)]]\nIn the 1960s, [[Bill Russell]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] further transformed basketball by combining height with a greater level of athleticism than previous centers. Following the retirement of [[George Mikan]], the rivalry of the two big men came to dominate the NBA. Between the two of them, Chamberlain and Russell won nine of the eleven [[NBA Most Valuable Player|MVP]] awards in the eleven-year period between 1958 and 1969; played against one another in six Eastern Conference Finals and two NBA Finals between 1959 and 1969. Many of the records set by these two players have endured today. Most notably, Chamberlain and Russell hold [[List of National Basketball Association top individual rebounding season averages|the top eighteen season averages for rebounds]].\n\n[[Bill Russell]] led the [[San Francisco Dons|University of San Francisco]] to two consecutive [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA championship]]s (1955, 56). He joined the [[Boston Celtics]] and helped make them one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history, winning eleven championships over his thirteen-year career (1956\u201369) as well as five MVP awards. Russell revolutionized defensive strategy with his shot-blocking, rebounding and physical [[man-to-man defense]]. While he was never the focal point of the Celtics offense, much of the team's scoring came when Russell grabbed defensive rebounds and initiated [[fast break]]s with precision outlet passes, primarily to [[point guard]] [[Bob Cousy]].  As the NBA's first African-American superstar, Russell struggled throughout his career with the racism he encountered from fans in [[Boston]], particularly after the 1966\u201367 season, when he became the first African-American in any major sport to be named [[player-coach]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonsportsreview.com/200707_story_cover.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009064738/http://www.bostonsportsreview.com/200707_story_cover.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nHis principal rival, [[Wilt Chamberlain]], listed at 7'1\" (2.15 m), 275 pounds (124&nbsp;kg), lacked Russell's supporting cast. Chamberlain played college ball for the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas Jayhawks]], leading them to the 1957 title game against the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]]. Although the Jayhawks lost by one point in triple overtime, Chamberlain was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Briefly a member of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] before joining the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] of the NBA in 1959, Chamberlain won two Championships, in 1967 with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and 1972 with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], although his teams were repeatedly defeated by the Celtics in the Eastern Conference and NBA Finals. He also won seven scoring titles, eleven rebounding titles, and four regular season [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] awards, including the distinction, in 1960, of being the first rookie to receive the award. Stronger than any player of his era, he was usually capable of scoring and rebounding at will. Although he was the target of constant double- and triple-teaming, as well as fouling tactics designed to take advantage of his poor free-throw shooting, he set a number of records that have never been broken. Most notably, Chamberlain is the only player in NBA history to average more than 50 points in a season and [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|score 100 points in a single game]] (both in 1961\u201362 as a member of the [[Philadelphia Warriors]]). He also holds the NBA's all-time records for rebounding average (27.2), rebounds in a single game (55),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19611962.html|title=NBA.com: Wilt Scores 100, Averages 50|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221152005/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19611962.html|archive-date=21 February 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders|career rebounds]] (23,924).\n\nA lesser-known center of the era was [[Nate Thurmond]], who initially played the forward position opposite [[Wilt Chamberlain]] for the [[San Francisco Warriors]] but moved to center after Chamberlain was traded to the new Philadelphia franchise. Although he never won a Championship, Thurmond was known as the best [[pick and roll|screen]] setter in the league, and his averages of 21.3 and 22.0 rebounds per game in 1966\u201367 and 1967\u201368, are exceeded only by Chamberlain and Russell.\n\n===Centers in the 1970s and 1980s: The era of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar===\n[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]\nIn contrast to the Celtics dynasty of the 1960s, the 1970s were a decade of parity in the NBA, with eight different champions and no back-to-back winners. At the college level, the [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA Bruins]], under Coach [[John Wooden]], built the greatest dynasty in NCAA basketball history, winning seven consecutive titles between 1967 and 1973. UCLA had already won two consecutive titles in 1964 and 1965 with teams that pressed and emphasized guard play.  After not winning in 1966, Wooden's teams changed their style when [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] became eligible.  He led UCLA to three championships-in 1967, '68 and '69-while winning the first [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] Award. During his college career, the NCAA enacted a ban on dunking primarily because of Alcindor's dominant use of the shot.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836963,00.html | work=Time | title=Basketball: Lew's Still Loose | date=1967-04-14 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> His entrance into the NBA with the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in 1969 was timely, as Bill Russell had just retired and Wilt Chamberlain was 33 years old and increasingly plagued by injuries. After leading the Bucks to the 1971 NBA championship, teamed up with legendary [[point guard]] [[Oscar Robertson]], Alcindor, who had converted to [[Islam]], changed his name to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. In 1975, Abdul-Jabbar was traded to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and, after the arrival of [[Point guard]] [[Magic Johnson]] in 1980, formed part of a new Lakers dynasty that won five NBA titles (1980, '82, '85, '87, '88). In addition, Abdul-Jabbar won six regular-season MVP awards (1971, '72, '74, '76, '77, '80). At 7'2\" (2.18 m), 235 pounds (106&nbsp;kg), he lacked the strength of Chamberlain in his prime, but had a longer wingspan and ultimately proved more durable, adhering to a strict physical-fitness regime that enabled him to play for twenty years, the longest career in NBA history at the time. Offensively, he was best known for his trademark 'Skyhook' hook-shot, almost impossible to block because of his height and wingspan. His career record of 38,387 points has yet to be broken.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/abduljabbar_bio.html|title=NBA.com: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bio|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Defensively, the 1973\u201374 season was the first in which the number of blocked shots were kept, and, over the next seven years, Kareem led the league in this statistic or finished second.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html|title=Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Stats - Basketball-Reference.com|website=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother product of John Wooden's UCLA program, [[Bill Walton]], appeared poised to join the ranks of great centers. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, he also led the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] to the NBA championship in 1977, and won the NBA MVP the following year. However, his career was plagued with injuries, most infamously a broken bone in his left foot suffered during his MVP season that he never fully recovered from, and he spent most of the following decade on the bench, although he eventually did win a second NBA title as a backup for the [[Boston Celtics]] in 1986, when he received the [[NBA Sixth Man Award|Sixth Man Award]]. [[Willis Reed]] won two championships with the [[New York Knicks]] in 1970 and 1973, teamed with Point guard [[Walt Frazier]]; although undersized for the center position at 6'9\", he had the strength to play inside, was a highly skilled jump shooter and was effective at setting [[pick and roll|pick]]s, a key element in the Knicks motion-oriented offense. The undersized but scrappy [[Dave Cowens]], drafted at the recommendation of Bill Russell, helped the [[Boston Celtics]] win two more NBA titles, in 1974 and 1976.\n\nLeading centers of the late 1970s and early 1980s include [[Wes Unseld]] of the [[Washington Wizards|Baltimore/Washington Bullets]], [[Artis Gilmore]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] [[Kentucky Colonels]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]]; [[Moses Malone]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Philadelphia 76ers]]; and [[Robert Parish]] of the [[Boston Celtics]], who was acquired from the [[Golden State Warriors]] in [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980]] for the top overall pick in the NBA Draft. Unseld led the Bullets to four NBA finals appearances and one championship, in 1978. Using his strength and determination to compensate for his lack of size (6'7\", i.e. 2.00 m), he was famous for his rebounding, shotblocking, and bone-jarring picks. [[Artis Gilmore]], often overlooked because of the mediocrity of his teams, established himself as the best low-post scorer in the league. He set the NCAA Division I record for career average in rebounds (25.2) at tiny [[Jacksonville University]], and enjoyed an illustrious [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] career before joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1976, playing there until he was traded to San Antonio in 1982, for whom he played until his retirement in 1987. He remains the NBA's career leader in field goal percentage (minimum 2000 shots made) with a 59.9 percentage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/gilmore_summary.html|title=NBA.com: Artis Gilmore Summary|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Malone, the first high school player to turn professional, was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] after several years in the ABA, and won two MVP Awards and led Houston to its first NBA Finals in 1981, before joining the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], where, teamed with [[Julius Erving]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]], he won an NBA Championship in 1983, as well as a third League MVP. Never a dominant defender, his quickness and tenacity made him one of the best rebounders in NBA history, particularly on the offensive end; he led the league in rebounds six times in a seven-year period and still holds the NBA record for offensive rebounds.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the 7'4\" (2.23 m) Eaton was the most prolific shot-blocker in the league, and, although never a major offensive contributor, won two [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s while helping transform the lowly [[Utah Jazz]] into a playoff contender. Of all these players, none enjoyed the success of [[Robert Parish]], who, with forwards [[Larry Bird]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], formed the legendary frontcourt of the [[Boston Celtics]] team that won three titles (1981, 1984 and 1986). The Celtics' fierce rivalry with the Lakers dominated the NBA during the decade and helped basketball reach an unprecedented level of popularity. Nicknamed \"Chief\" after a character in the film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' because of his stoic demeanor, Parish was known for his trademark arching jump-shot\u2014leading many experts to consider him the best medium-range shooting center of all time{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\u2014and his ability to finish fast-breaks with his surprising speed. Playing until the age of 43, Parish broke Abdul-Jabbar's record for career games played.\n\nThe [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380 season]] saw the introduction of the [[three-point field goal|three-point shot]]. While the concept of the 'stretch five' would not come until the new millennium, one of the first proponents of the position was [[Bill Laimbeer]]. Though he was better known for his brute physical style of play with the 'Bad Boys' [[Detroit Pistons]], Laimbeer also possessed a reliable three-point shot, hitting 33% from long range in his career.\n\n===Centers in the 1990s: Olajuwon, Ewing, and Robinson===\n[[File:Hakeemsigningautocropped.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hakeem Olajuwon]]\nCoach [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]], once a seldom-used backup to [[Bill Russell]] with the Celtics, developed the [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown Hoyas]] into a chief pipeline for talent at the Center position, producing a succession of great defensive big men in [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Dikembe Mutombo]] and [[Alonzo Mourning]]. In 1984, Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, defeated the [[University of Houston]], led by [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], to win the NCAA championship. The number one picks in the [[1984 NBA draft|1984]], [[1985 NBA draft|1985]], and [[1987 NBA draft|1987]] NBA Drafts would all be used on centers who made major impacts in the NBA of the 1990s and eventually became members of the Basketball Hall of Fame: Olajuwon in 1984, Ewing in 1985, and [[Navy Midshipmen men's basketball|Navy's]] [[David Robinson]] in 1987. \n\nThe [[Nigeria]]n-born Olajuwon was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] and paired with [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Ralph Sampson]] in what was dubbed the 'Twin Towers' duo. In his second season, 1985\u201386, the Rockets upset the Lakers in the Western Conference finals. Olajuwon established himself as a dominant player, leading the Rockets to two consecutive NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. In the 1993\u201394 season he became the only player in NBA history to win the NBA's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP), [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], and [[NBA Finals MVP|Finals MVP]] awards in the same season. Defensively Olajuwon broke Abdul-Jabbar's career record for blocked shots. Offensively, he was best known for his 'Dream Shake', a series of fakes and spin moves regarded as the pinnacle of big man footwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/program_olajuwon.html|title=It Was All A Dream|website=Nba.com|accessdate=21 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213021343/http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/program_olajuwon.html|archive-date=13 December 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEwing, from [[Jamaica]] by way of the [[Greater Boston|Boston area]], was drafted by the [[New York Knicks]] in 1985, with whom he spent fifteen of his seventeen seasons in the NBA. An eleven-time All Star, Ewing was one of the best shooting centers in NBA history, possessing a baseline jump-shot, as well as being a formidable shot blocker and rebounder. The Knicks were formidable opponents of the [[Chicago Bulls]] dynasty in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Ewing's successor as the starting center at Georgetown, [[Dikembe Mutombo]], who played most of his NBA career with the [[Denver Nuggets]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]] proved a dominant defender. Mutombo, who had not played basketball before arriving in the U.S. from his native [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] on a [[USAID]] scholarship, was among the greatest shot blockers in NBA history, leading the NBA in blocked-shots five consecutive years, in the course of a career in which he ranked second in the history of the league in blocked shots, behind only Hakeem Olajuwon. He was also the recipient of four [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s, tied for the record with [[Ben Wallace]].\n\nThe [[1992 NBA draft]] marked the entrance into the league of [[Shaquille O'Neal]], who was drafted by the [[Orlando Magic]]. Immediately drawing comparisons to Wilt Chamberlain, the 7'1\" (2.15 m), 325-pound (147&nbsp;kg) O'Neal was billed as potentially the most physically dominating player ever. By his third season, he led the league in scoring and led the Magic to the NBA Finals, where they were swept by the [[Houston Rockets]]. After the 1995\u201396 season, he signed with the rebuilding [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Former Georgetown center [[Alonzo Mourning]], also drafted in 1992, established himself as a premier big man with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] and, later, the [[Miami Heat]], winning two Defensive Player of the Year Awards thanks to his prolific shot blocking while also proving a reliable scoring threat.\n\n===Centers in the 2000s: The era of Shaquille O'Neal===\n[[File:Lipofsky Shaquille O'Neal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Shaquille O'Neal]]\nThe balance of power shifted to the Western Conference, and the NBA was dominated by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who won titles in 2000, '01, '02, '09, and '10, and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], who won in '99, '03, '05, '07 and '14. The Lakers hired former Bulls coach [[Phil Jackson]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] thrived in Jackson's [[triangle offense]]. The [[San Antonio Spurs]] were initially led by the 'Twin Towers' tandem of center [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Tim Duncan]]. With the arrival of Duncan, the veteran Robinson modified his game by playing primarily in the high post to accommodate Duncan's strengths as a low-post scorer and defender.\n\nIn the 1990s, an increasing number of smaller forwards, most notably [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Charles Barkley]], excelled at the traditional center functions of rebounding, shot-blocking and low-post defense, anticipating a trend towards relying on shorter and quicker post players that has continued into the 2000s, as exemplified by perennial Defensive Players of the Year [[Ben Wallace]]. In the [[fast break]] oriented style of offense employed by a growing number of teams, the traditional role of the center is diminished, if not done away with altogether. Many talented big men choose to play the more versatile [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position, giving them more room to run the floor and play outside the paint. Under the influence of European basketball, the offensive role of big men has been redefined to include more emphasis on perimeter play, as exemplified by 3-point shooting big men like [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Mehmet Okur]], [[Andrea Bargnani]] and [[Channing Frye]].\n\nThe {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|2}} [[Yao Ming]] was drafted by the [[Houston Rockets]] with tremendous hype in 2002. Yao proved to be a highly efficient rebounder and scorer, particularly with his mid-range jump shot, and showed the potential to be an elite defender. However, he would retire in 2011 due to a string of foot injuries that caused him to miss all but five games in his final two NBA seasons. Another heralded young prospect, [[Dwight Howard]], has used his exceptional vertical leap to become one of the top rebounders in the NBA.\n\n===Centers in the 2010s: The rise of \"stretch five\"===\nThe low-post functions of the center position continued to dwindle in the 2010s as the NBA embraced [[small ball (basketball)|small ball]] and a more perimeter-oriented style of play. While there are still a few centers that play a more traditional style, some centers begin to adapt to the outside game.\n[[File:Dwight Howard.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Dwight Howard]]]]\n\nThe [[Miami Heat]], for example, featured a \"positionless\" lineup as coined by head coach [[Erik Spoelstra]], with power forwards [[Chris Bosh]] and [[Udonis Haslem]] shifting between center and power forward depending on matchups. The Heat won two NBA championships in {{nbafy|2012}} and {{nbafy|2013}} using this unconventional lineup.\n\nThe [[Golden State Warriors]] then won three championships in {{nbafy|2015}}, {{nbafy|2017}} and {{nbafy|2018}} with a smaller and quicker group known as the [[Death Lineup]]. In this case, 6'7\" forward [[Draymond Green]] was often slotted into the center position, creating matchup problems for larger centers with his defensive versatility, speed, ball-handling skills, and perimeter shooting.\n\nThe rise of the stretch five paved the way for centers to add outside shooting to their arsenal. While they continue to roam the paint at times, they have also expanded their game to the perimeter with their three-point shots.\n\nAnother byproduct of the small ball revolution is the emergence of so-called \"unicorns\", or big men who possess guard-like skills. An example of a \"unicorn\" is [[Nikola Joki\u0107]], whose passing ability for a player his size made the Denver Nuggets contenders in the late 2010s.\n\n==Centers in women's basketball==\nIn women's basketball, 7'0\" (2.13 m) [[Iuliana Semenova]] played the center position, helping the Soviet Union women's team win two Olympic Gold medals, in 1976 and 1980, and never losing a game in international competition. Semenova also led her club team, TTT [[Riga]] to fifteen European Champion's Cup titles. The 6'8\" (2.03 m) [[Anne Donovan]] led the [[Old Dominion University]] Lady Monarchs to the 1979 [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] championship, and was the first female [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] recipient in 1983, before enjoying a successful professional career in Japan and Italy.\n[[File:Margo_Dydek_1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Margo Dydek]]]]\nWith the formation of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], [[Lisa Leslie]] established herself as the premier center, and the league's most popular player. The first WNBA player to reach the 3,000 point milestone, she led the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] to consecutive titles in 2001 and 2002, and holds the distinction of being the first player to dunk in a WNBA game. Other prominent centers in women's basketball include Australian [[Lauren Jackson]] of the [[Seattle Storm]] and [[Karl Malone]]'s daughter [[Cheryl Ford]] of the [[Detroit Shock]]. Jackson can also be considered a [[forward-center]] because she is also a very good outside shooter, leading the WNBA in three-point shooting percentage in one season. [[Rebecca Lobo]] led the [[Connecticut Huskies]] to a [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship]] in 1995, but never recovered from a [[anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn ACL]] and had a disappointing professional career. When at the [[University of Oklahoma]], [[Courtney Paris]] was considered the next dominant female center after becoming the only NCAA player, male or female, to score 700 points, grab 500 rebounds and block 100 shots in a single season; however, she had a disappointing WNBA career and was waived before what would have been the start of her second season in 2010.  The tallest center in the WNBA, the late [[Margo Dydek]] of Poland, who stood 7'2\", is still the league's career leader in blocks per game (2.72) and total blocks (877), solidly ahead of Leslie in that category despite Dydek having played 40 fewer games before retiring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics: All-time leaders: Blocks|url=http://www.wnba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersBPGQuery.html?topic=0&stat=14|website=Wnba.com|accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref> Perhaps the most highly touted center in the women's game in decades, if not in history, is current [[Phoenix Mercury]] superstar [[Brittney Griner]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Basketball centers}}\n* {{cite book |first=Kirk |last=Goldsberry |authorlink=Kirk Goldsberry |chapter=What a Time to Be a Five |title=SprawlBall: A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2019 |pages=178\u2013189 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yaDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA178 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Heisler |first=Mark |title=Giants: The 25 Greatest Centers of All Time |year=2003 |publisher=Triumph Books |location=Chicago |isbn=1-57243-577-1}}\n\n{{Basketball Positions}}\n\n[[Category:Basketball positions]]\n[[Category:Basketball terminology]]\n[[Category:Centers (basketball)| ]]\n", "name_user": "Urgal", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)"}

The series aired during the network's [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning schedule]] from September 10, 1977 to June 21, 1980.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=108-109 }}</ref> All 40 episodes are available on the [[Boomerang (TV network)]] subscription app.\n\n==Summary==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' centers on the mystery-solving adventures of the Teen Angels\u2014'''Brenda''', '''Dee Dee''' and '''Taffy'''\u2014and their friend '''Captain Caveman''' (or Cavey for short), a prehistoric caveman whom the girls discovered and thawed from a block of ice. The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (which also aired on ABC).<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/62/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=62-63}}</ref> The show also borrowed heavily from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', among others. \n\nCaptain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!\" Captain Caveman's voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]].\n\nA total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when ''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977\u201379. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in [[Sport|sporting competitions]] as part of \"[[Laff-A-Lympics#The Scooby Doobies|The Scooby Doobies]]\" team on the half-hour ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of the Hanna-Barbera last productions to do so.\n\n==Characters==\n===Captain Caveman===\nCaptain Caveman, or \"Cavey\" for short (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]), is the protagonist of the show, billed as \"the world's first superhero.\" He is a [[caveman]] who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, \"I'll be 2 million next month.\") He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (\"Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.\" ''CRASH!''), which was a reference to the [[1973 oil crisis#Price controls and rationing|gasoline rationing shortages]] of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical \"caveman-talk\", replacing [[subject pronoun]]s with their [[object pronoun|object]] equivalents and dropping [[article (grammar)|articles]] such as \"the\" (for example, \"Me know where bad guys are hiding.\"), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase \"unga bunga\". He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (i.e. [[bicycle]]s, [[Television|TV]] sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery.\n\n===Dee Dee Sykes===\nDee Dee Sykes (voiced by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]) is the brains of the Teen Angels and acts as their unofficial leader. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an [[afro]] and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to [[Velma Dinkley]] of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]''. She is misidentified as Brenda in the [[opening credits]].\n\n===Brenda Chance===\nBrenda Chance (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She also acts as Dee Dee's sergeant of the Teen Angels. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.\n\n===Taffy Dare===\nTaffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member of the group, renowned for her cry of \"Zowie!\" whenever she comes up with a plan (or \"Another Daffy Taffy Plan\" as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a [[New York City English|New York-influenced]]/Southern [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. She also acts as Dee Dee's second-in-command of the Teen Angels. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' was broadcast in these following formats on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:\n\n* '''''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''''' (September 10, 1977 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Scooby's All-Stars''''' (September 9, 1978 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels''''' (March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday)\n\nBroadcast schedules (all [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n*September 10, 1977 \u2013 July 1978, ABC Saturday 9:00-11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*July 1978 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday 9:30-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*September 9, 1978 \u2013 November 1978, ABC Saturday 10:00-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*November 1978 \u2013 May 1979, ABC Saturday 8:00-9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*May 1979 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday 8:30-10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday 11:30-12:00 noon\n\n==Opening and closing credits==\nThe opening credits for each episode consisted of voice-over narration by [[Gary Owens]]:\n<blockquote>''Set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice, comes the world's first superhero, Captain Caveman!

Captain Caveman worked at ''The Daily Granite'' newspaper with [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]. His \"secret identity\" was Chester, the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.\n\n===The Flintstone Kids (1986\u201388)===\nIn 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' called ''Captain Caveman and Son'' with his son, Cavey Jr. (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain's mumbled \"unga bunga\" became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each \"episode\" of the show.  The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue.  The whole \"secret identity\" idea was also ignored or forgotten.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made an appearance in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.\n\n* Captain Caveman later appeared in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode \"The Evolutionary War\" with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]] and Cavey Jr. voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. His son Cavey Jr. was teased at school because his existence proved the [[Creation and evolution in public education|Theory of Evolution]].\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in the style of the [[Munich massacre]], Captain Caveman and [[Shaggy Rogers]] confront [[Daisy Mayhem]] and Captain Caveman blows her up with the wrong club.\n\n* Characters that look very similar to Captain Caveman appear as enemies in the 8-bit computer game ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n* In the [[Halloween]] 2008 episode of ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman costume. He then exclaims \"Daaa!! AaAah'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!\"\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode named \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\", Peter expresses how much he misses Captain Caveman, and vows that he will see him again once he gets off the island.\n\n* Captain Caveman also makes a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' where he is seen as a stuffed doll in Finn's room.\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Mystery Solvers Club State Finals,\" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He and the Teen Angels appear alongside other Hanna-Barbera detective teams in a fever dream of Scooby-Doo's. When the teenage sleuths are kidnapped by Lord Infernacus, it is up to their sidekicks to save them.\n\n* In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', there is a person who's cosplaying as Captain Caveman in a Hanna-Barbera convention.\n\n* Captain Caveman is seen briefly in the background in ''[[Imaginationland: The Movie|South Park - Imaginationland: The Movie]]'' (2008). He is amongst a plethora of other imaginary and cartoon characters who are being attacked by terrorists.\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]'' episode \"'Caveman Begins\", voiced by Tom Megalis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BqLQA2SlGTx/|title=I tell stories on Instagram: \u201cRecording Captain Caveman voice for Warner Brothers new show\u201d Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs.\u201d . . . . #voiceacting #voiceactor #actor #vo #acting\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels will appear in ''[[Jellystone!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/hbo-max-looney-tunes-jellystone-the-fungies-tig-n-seek-kids-family-series-1202771895/|title=HBO Max Sets New Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Robert Zemeckis Hybrid Series \u2018Tooned Out\u2019, More For Kids & Family Slate|first1=Patrick|last1=Hipes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and Dee Dee Sykes will appear in the upcoming theatrical animated ''Scooby-Doo'' film ''[[Scoob!]]'' with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Tracy Morgan]] and Dee Dee Sykes voiced by [[Kiersey Clemons]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/scooby-doo-movie-star-will-forte-gina-rodriguez-tracy-morgan-1177354|title=Will Forte, Gina Rodriguez and Tracy Morgan to Star in Animated Scooby-Doo Movie (Exclusive)|first=Borys|last=Kit|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 1, 2019|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/scooby-doo-movie-scoob-ken-jeong-kiersey-clemons-join-cast-1202593116/|title=Ken Jeong & Kiersey Clemons Toon Up For Warner Bros.\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-04-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> It is currently unknown if Brenda and Taffy will also appear.\n\n==Comic books==\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in all 13 issues of ''Laff-A-Lympics'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 1978\u201379) as members of the Scooby Doobies.\n* Cavey and the Angels appeared in the first issue of the short-lived ''Hanna-Barbera TV Stars'' (Marvel, August 1978).<ref name=TVS1>{{comicbookdb|issue|103865|TV Stars #1}}</ref>\n* The Captain and the Angels team up with Mystery, Inc. in ''Scooby-Doo'' #9 (Marvel, February 1979).<ref name=SD9>{{comicbookdb|issue|94377|Scooby-Doo #9}}</ref>\n* In 2018, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in a backup story in the [[DC Comics|DC]] comic ''Aquaman/ Jabberjaw Special'' #1;<ref name=AJ1>{{comicbookdb|issue|442713|Aquaman/Jabberjaw Special #1}}</ref> in this story, the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] transports the powerful hominid from prehistoric times to the present, to settle an argument with [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] about whether heroism is strictly a trait of modern man or also of early man.\n\n==Production credits==\n* Executive Producers: [[Joseph Barbera]] and [[William Hanna]]\n* Director: [[Charles August Nichols|Charles A.

The series aired during the network's [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning schedule]] from September 10, 1977 to June 21, 1980.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=108-109 }}</ref> All 40 episodes are available on the [[Boomerang (TV network)]] subscription app.\n\n==Summary==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' centers on the mystery-solving adventures of the Teen Angels\u2014'''Brenda''', '''Dee Dee''' and '''Taffy'''\u2014and their friend '''Captain Caveman''' (or Cavey for short), a prehistoric caveman whom the girls discovered and thawed from a block of ice. The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (which also aired on ABC).<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/62/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=62-63}}</ref> The show also borrowed heavily from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', among others. \n\nCaptain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!\" Captain Caveman's voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]].\n\nA total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when ''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977\u201379. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in [[Sport|sporting competitions]] as part of \"[[Laff-A-Lympics#The Scooby Doobies|The Scooby Doobies]]\" team on the half-hour ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of the Hanna-Barbera last productions to do so.\n\n==Characters==\n===Captain Caveman===\nCaptain Caveman, or \"Cavey\" for short (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]), is the protagonist of the show, billed as \"the world's first superhero.\" He is a [[caveman]] who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, \"I'll be 2 million next month.\") He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (\"Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.\" ''CRASH!''), which was a reference to the [[1973 oil crisis#Price controls and rationing|gasoline rationing shortages]] of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical \"caveman-talk\", replacing [[subject pronoun]]s with their [[object pronoun|object]] equivalents and dropping [[article (grammar)|articles]] such as \"the\" (for example, \"Me know where bad guys are hiding.\"), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase \"unga bunga\". He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (i.e. [[bicycle]]s, [[Television|TV]] sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery.\n\n===Dee Dee Sykes===\nDee Dee Sykes (voiced by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]) is the brains of the Teen Angels and acts as their unofficial leader. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an [[afro]] and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to [[Velma Dinkley]] of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]''. She is misidentified as Brenda in the [[opening credits]].\n\n===Brenda Chance===\nBrenda Chance (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She also acts as Dee Dee's sergeant of the Teen Angels. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.\n\n===Taffy Dare===\nTaffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member of the group, renowned for her cry of \"Zowie!\" whenever she comes up with a plan (or \"Another Daffy Taffy Plan\" as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a [[New York City English|New York-influenced]]/Southern [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. She also acts as Dee Dee's second-in-command of the Teen Angels. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' was broadcast in these following formats on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:\n\n* '''''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''''' (September 10, 1977 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Scooby's All-Stars''''' (September 9, 1978 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels''''' (March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday)\n\nBroadcast schedules (all [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n*September 10, 1977 \u2013 July 1978, ABC Saturday 9:00-11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*July 1978 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday 9:30-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*September 9, 1978 \u2013 November 1978, ABC Saturday 10:00-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*November 1978 \u2013 May 1979, ABC Saturday 8:00-9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*May 1979 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday 8:30-10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday 11:30-12:00 noon\n\n==Opening and closing credits==\nThe opening credits for each episode consisted of voice-over narration by [[Gary Owens]]:\n<blockquote>''Set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice, comes the world's first superhero, Captain Caveman!

Captain Caveman worked at ''The Daily Granite'' newspaper with [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]. His \"secret identity\" was Chester, the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.\n\n===The Flintstone Kids (1986\u201388)===\nIn 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' called ''Captain Caveman and Son'' with his son, Cavey Jr. (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain's mumbled \"unga bunga\" became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each \"episode\" of the show.  The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue.  The whole \"secret identity\" idea was also ignored or forgotten.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made an appearance in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.\n\n* Captain Caveman later appeared in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode \"The Evolutionary War\" with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]] and Cavey Jr. voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. His son Cavey Jr. was teased at school because his existence proved the [[Creation and evolution in public education|Theory of Evolution]].\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in the style of the [[Munich massacre]], Captain Caveman and [[Shaggy Rogers]] confront [[Daisy Mayhem]] and Captain Caveman blows her up with the wrong club.\n\n* Characters that look very similar to Captain Caveman appear as enemies in the 8-bit computer game ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n* In the [[Halloween]] 2008 episode of ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman costume. He then exclaims \"Daaa!! AaAah'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!\"\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode named \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\", Peter expresses how much he misses Captain Caveman, and vows that he will see him again once he gets off the island.\n\n* Captain Caveman also makes a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' where he is seen as a stuffed doll in Finn's room.\n\n* Captain Caveman appears in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Mystery Solvers Club State Finals,\" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He and the Teen Angels appear alongside other Hanna-Barbera detective teams in a fever dream of Scooby-Doo's. When the teenage sleuths are kidnapped by Lord Infernacus, it is up to their sidekicks to save them.\n\n* In ''[[Scooby-Doo!

It is based on a short [[cartoon book]] of the same name by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long.\n\n==Plot==\n{{confusing section|date=March 2015}}\nAndie Anderson ([[Kate Hudson]]) is a writer for the women's magazine ''Composure'' as the \"How to\", [[subject-matter expert]]. She is bored and wishes she could write about more serious topics such as politics, economics, religion, poverty; matters she is genuinely concerned with. After Andie's best friend Michelle ([[Kathryn Hahn]]) experiences yet another break-up, Andie is inspired to write a new article titled \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\"; she will start dating a guy and eventually drive him away using only the \"classic mistakes women make\" in relationships.\n\nAt the same time, [[Advertisement|advertising]] executive Benjamin \"Ben\" Barry ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) is striving for a pitch to advertise a new diamond campaign. When his boss questions Ben's knowledge about romance, Ben bets he could make any woman fall in love with him if he wanted to. His boss accepts the bet and confirms that if he can make any woman fall in love with him before the upcoming company ball, in just 10 days, he will allow Ben to head the advertising for the new diamond company. Ben's rival co-workers, Judy Spears and Judy Green ([[Michael Michele]] and [[Shalom Harlow]]), who were at Composure magazine earlier in the day and are aware of Andie's new assignment, set Ben up to have him pick Andie as the girl to test his theory on.\n\nBen and Andie meet and soon start their quests, neither revealing their true intentions. Andie works hard to drive Ben insane and make him break up with her in order to complete her article, but Ben continues to stick around in hopes of making her fall in love with him. Andie gets Ben knocked out in a movie theater by talking aloud while watching a [[chick flick]], rapidly moves her things into his apartment, acts overly possessive and sensitive and clingy, ruins his boys' poker night for him and his friends, and takes him to a [[Celine Dion]] concert when he was under the assumption he was going to see a [[New York Knicks]] basketball game.\n\nBen stays with her despite everything, and after coming very close to breaking up they attend couples counseling, led by Andie's friend Michelle. They agree, as a solution to their problems, to visit Ben's family in [[Staten Island]] for the weekend. While vacationing together Ben and Andie begin to form a genuine bond, and upon arriving home Ben even refers to Andie as his girlfriend. Andie then tries to explain to her boss Lana ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]) that she cannot continue writing and publishing this article as she has \"really got to know this guy\", but Lana remains insistent upon it. Around the same time, Andie and Ben go to the company ball together where Ben's boss, Phillip ([[Robert Klein]]), meets Andie and tells Ben that he \"met her, she loves you, you win\".\n\nSeeing Ben's good news, Judy and Judy are instantly envious and set about to ruin it for their co-worker. They tell his close colleagues, Tony and Thayer ([[Adam Goldberg]] and [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]]), that Andie knew about the bet all along and was playing along to help Ben win. Tony and Thayer then rush to Andie's side and beg her to keep quiet, when they do not realize she is still blissfully unaware of the bet. Almost simultaneously, Lana, who is unaware of Ben's role in Andie's \"How To\" article, reveals Andie's true intentions to Ben. Upon learning of Ben's bet, Andie attempts to humiliate Ben in front of everyone at the party, and the pair argue on stage.\n\nThey go their separate ways before Ben is shown Andie's article and encouraged to read it. She explains in it how she \"lost the one person she ever fell for\", and, when he hears she quit her job at Composure and is on her way to Washington, D.C. for an interview, he chases her taxi and stops her. Once he accuses her of running away, they reveal their true feelings for each other and the film ends with Ben instructing the taxi driver to return Andie's belongings to her home, and then they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Andie Anderson\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Benjamin Barry\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Michelle\n* [[Annie Parisse]] as Jeannie\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Tony\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Thayer\n* [[Michael Michele]] as Judy Spears\n* [[Shalom Harlow]] as Judy Green\n* [[Robert Klein]] as Phillip Warren\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Lana Jang\n* [[Liliane Montevecchi]] as Mrs. DeLauer\n* [[Marvin Hamlisch]] as Himself (Cameo)\n\n==Production==\n[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and director [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] were originally attached to the project but producer Lynda Obst was unable to get Newell to commit to a date and Paltrow went on to work on the film ''[[View from the Top]]''.<ref name=\"ew-obst\">{{cite web | author = EW STAFF | date = 2003-02-07 | title = How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days | url = https://ew.com/article/2003/02/07/how-lose-guy-10-days/ }}</ref>\n\nThe yellow gown Kate Hudson wore in the movie was created by celebrity designer Dina Bar-El.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Laura Vecsey|title=Fashion designer Dina Bar-El looks for fresh start|url=http://www.today.com/home/fashion-designer-dina-bar-el-looks-fresh-start-2D79591524|publisher=Today; NBC News|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> The necklace she wears with the yellow gown is called, in the film, the \"Isadora Diamond\" named after [[Isadora Duncan]].

Once he accuses her of running away, they reveal their true feelings for each other and the film ends with Ben instructing the taxi driver to return Andie's belongings to her home, and then they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kate Hudson]] as Andie Anderson\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Benjamin Barry\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Michelle\n* [[Annie Parisse]] as Jeannie\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Tony\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Thayer\n* [[Michael Michele]] as Judy Spears\n* [[Shalom Harlow]] as Judy Green\n* [[Robert Klein]] as Phillip Warren\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Lana Jang\n* [[Liliane Montevecchi]] as Mrs. DeLauer\n* [[Marvin Hamlisch]] as Himself (Cameo)\n\n==Production==\n[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and director [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] were originally attached to the project but producer Lynda Obst was unable to get Newell to commit to a date and Paltrow went on to work on the film ''[[View from the Top]]''.<ref name=\"ew-obst\">{{cite web | author = EW STAFF | date = 2003-02-07 | title = How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days | url = https://ew.com/article/2003/02/07/how-lose-guy-10-days/ }}</ref>\n\nThe yellow gown Kate Hudson wore in the movie was created by celebrity designer Dina Bar-El.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Laura Vecsey|title=Fashion designer Dina Bar-El looks for fresh start|url=http://www.today.com/home/fashion-designer-dina-bar-el-looks-fresh-start-2D79591524|publisher=Today; NBC News|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> The necklace she wears with the yellow gown is called, in the film, the \"Isadora Diamond\" named after [[Isadora Duncan]].
