It is located to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston]] and [[Montreal]], among other destinations. Ottawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. \n\nIt was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. To the south of the station building are the 5 [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks bordering on Terminal Avenue. \n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967. In 2000, the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] named the station as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium.<ref name=\"RAIC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|title=Cultural consequence|last=Cook|first=Maria|work=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=Canwest|date=11 May 2000|accessdate=11 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090211/http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|archivedate=30 May 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Union Station Ottawa a034379.jpg|thumb|Ottawa's former Union Station in the 1920s]]\nOttawa's trains once came into the large downtown [[Senate of Canada Building|Union Station]] (active 1912\u20131966), a short distance from the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament buildings]] and south of the [[Ch\u00e2teau Laurier]] Hotel. However, in 1966 the railway tracks beside the [[Rideau Canal]] were replaced by the [[National Capital Commission]]\u2019s [[Colonel By Drive]] scenic parkway as part of an [[Greber Plan|urban renewal plan]]. Initially the former station was converted into a [[Government Conference Centre]] before becoming a new temporary home for the [[Senate of Canada]] (2019- ), as extensive renovations are conducted on their former location in the [[Centre Block]] building on [[Parliament Hill]].\n\nPer a sign located inside the station: <blockquote>\"The Ottawa Station was completed in 1966 as part of a plan for the relocation and consolidation of many railway lines built between 1854 and 1916.

The city's prior prosperity in the orchard industry, especially apples, was further strengthened by the rail connection. Following the decline of the apple industry in the 1930s, Gentry shifted its economy towards [[poultry]] along with many other areas of northwest Arkansas.<ref name=\"eoa\" >{{ cite web |title= Gentry (Benton County) |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=831 |work= [[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture]] |publisher= [[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]] at the [[Central Arkansas Library System]] |date= May 16, 2012 |last= Lancaster |first= Guy |accessdate= May 27, 2013 }}</ref> Today, Gentry is located within the [[Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers Metropolitan Area]]. Gentry is known for the [[Wild Wilderness Drive-Through Safari]], located {{convert|2|mi|0}} north of the city limits.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gentry, Arkansas (1912).jpg|thumb|left|Gentry in 1912]]\n[[File:Bank of Gentry.jpg|left|thumb|The historic [[Bank of Gentry]] building was built in 1904 and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\" >{{NRISref|2010a}}</ref>]]\nGentry began as a rural Ozark agricultural community named '''Orchard City'''.  Located in western Benton County, it was known for its apple orchards and other produce. The town began to grow when the [[Kansas City Southern Railroad]] was constructed through the town. In 1894, residents of the community petitioned the county to officially incorporate, and the city's name was changed to Gentry, after an official in charge of the construction of the railroad.\n\nThe railroad proved important to Gentry, and by 1903 the town had grown to a population of 1,000. This population doesn\u2019t jive with what the chart below says.\n\nThe railroad company built a new depot in Gentry in 1926\u20131927. It was known as one of the nicest depots on the railway line. A banquet was held for the grand opening, and railway officials arrived on a special train to commemorate the event. Four to six passenger trains a week came through Gentry until passenger service was discontinued in 1964.\n\nIn 1937, [[Arkansas Highway 59|Highway 59]] was built, running through the city north and south. It remains the main highway through the city, linking Gentry with other west Benton County communities.<ref name=\"eoa\" />\n\nIn 1946, the City Council voted to buy a water tank for $1,650 from the War Assets Corporation in [[Kentucky]].  In 1948, the city held a special election to issue bonds to install larger water mains and additional fireplugs. In the 1950s, the city purchased its own water company. At the beginning of the 21st century, Gentry was expanding water lines into rural areas surrounding the community.\n\nUsing donations, local businesses built the first auditorium at the intersection of Main and Collins streets. The building now houses the city's police department and courtroom.\n\nIn the 1960s, when agriculture was no longer the economic base it had once been for the city and the railroad, the train depot was torn down.\n\nThe next decade saw the beginning of the construction of a [[power plant]] by [[American Electric Power|Southwestern Electric Power Company]] (often known as SWEPCO). The plant, located {{convert|1|mi}} west of the city limits, is a coal-fueled electric generating facility called [[Flint Creek Power Plant]]. Today SWEPCO continues to provide electrical power, and SWEPCO Lake (shown on maps as \"Lake Flint Creek\") is used for fishing and recreation. To ease traffic through downtown, a new [[Arkansas Highway 12]] bypass was built on the southern edge of town. In the early 1970s, the Wild Wilderness Drive-Through Safari was established north of town. The {{convert|400|acre|adj=on}} park is home to a variety of exotic animals and consists of a {{convert|4|mi|0}} drive-through, petting parks and walk-through areas for interaction with the animals. In 1983, the [[McKee Foods Corporation]] (then known as McKee Baking Company) opened its manufacturing facility in Gentry.<ref name=\"eoa\" />\n\nThe city celebrated its centennial in 1994 and held a 110th Birthday Bash in 2004.\n\n==Geography==\nGentry is located at {{Coord|36|16|1|N|94|29|3|W|type:city}} (36.266899, -94.484304)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the intersection of [[Arkansas Highway 12|Highway&nbsp;12]] and Highway&nbsp;59.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.0|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.05|sqkm|disp=flip|3}}, or 0.44%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 419\n|1910= 668\n|1920= 724\n|1930= 779\n|1940= 726\n|1950= 729\n|1960= 686\n|1970= 1022\n|1980= 1468\n|1990= 1726\n|2000= 2165\n|2010= 3158\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3868\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref><br>2015 Estimate<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015-3.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019182931/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015-3.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 19, 2016|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2016 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Image:Gentry Arkansas Lamppost.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Lamppost in Downtown Gentry, Arkansas]]\nAs of 2010 the population of Gentry was 3,158.

The city's prior prosperity in the orchard industry, especially apples, was further strengthened by the rail connection. Following the decline of the apple industry in the 1930s, Gentry shifted its economy towards [[poultry]] along with many other areas of northwest Arkansas.<ref name=\"eoa\" >{{ cite web |title= Gentry (Benton County) |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=831 |work= [[Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture]] |publisher= [[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]] at the [[Central Arkansas Library System]] |date= May 16, 2012 |last= Lancaster |first= Guy |accessdate= May 27, 2013 }}</ref> Today, Gentry is located within the [[Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers Metropolitan Area]].

Located in western Benton County, it was known for its apple orchards and other produce. The town began to grow when the [[Kansas City Southern Railroad]] was constructed through the town. In 1894, residents of the community petitioned the county to officially incorporate, and the city's name was changed to Gentry, after an official in charge of the construction of the railroad.\n\nThe railroad proved important to Gentry, and by 1903 the town had grown to a population of 1,000.\n\nThe railroad company built a new depot in Gentry in 1926\u20131927. It was known as one of the nicest depots on the railway line. A banquet was held for the grand opening, and railway officials arrived on a special train to commemorate the event. Four to six passenger trains a week came through Gentry until passenger service was discontinued in 1964.\n\nIn 1937, [[Arkansas Highway 59|Highway 59]] was built, running through the city north and south. It remains the main highway through the city, linking Gentry with other west Benton County communities.<ref name=\"eoa\" />\n\nIn 1946, the City Council voted to buy a water tank for $1,650 from the War Assets Corporation in [[Kentucky]].  In 1948, the city held a special election to issue bonds to install larger water mains and additional fireplugs. In the 1950s, the city purchased its own water company. At the beginning of the 21st century, Gentry was expanding water lines into rural areas surrounding the community.\n\nUsing donations, local businesses built the first auditorium at the intersection of Main and Collins streets. The building now houses the city's police department and courtroom.\n\nIn the 1960s, when agriculture was no longer the economic base it had once been for the city and the railroad, the train depot was torn down.\n\nThe next decade saw the beginning of the construction of a [[power plant]] by [[American Electric Power|Southwestern Electric Power Company]] (often known as SWEPCO). The plant, located {{convert|1|mi}} west of the city limits, is a coal-fueled electric generating facility called [[Flint Creek Power Plant]]. Today SWEPCO continues to provide electrical power, and SWEPCO Lake (shown on maps as \"Lake Flint Creek\") is used for fishing and recreation. To ease traffic through downtown, a new [[Arkansas Highway 12]] bypass was built on the southern edge of town. In the early 1970s, the Wild Wilderness Drive-Through Safari was established north of town. The {{convert|400|acre|adj=on}} park is home to a variety of exotic animals and consists of a {{convert|4|mi|0}} drive-through, petting parks and walk-through areas for interaction with the animals. In 1983, the [[McKee Foods Corporation]] (then known as McKee Baking Company) opened its manufacturing facility in Gentry.<ref name=\"eoa\" />\n\nThe city celebrated its centennial in 1994 and held a 110th Birthday Bash in 2004.\n\n==Geography==\nGentry is located at {{Coord|36|16|1|N|94|29|3|W|type:city}} (36.266899, -94.484304)<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the intersection of [[Arkansas Highway 12|Highway&nbsp;12]] and Highway&nbsp;59.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.0|km2|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.05|sqkm|disp=flip|3}}, or 0.44%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 419\n|1910= 668\n|1920= 724\n|1930= 779\n|1940= 726\n|1950= 729\n|1960= 686\n|1970= 1022\n|1980= 1468\n|1990= 1726\n|2000= 2165\n|2010= 3158\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=3868\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref><br>2015 Estimate<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015-3.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019182931/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2015/SUB-EST2015-3.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 19, 2016|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2016 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n[[Image:Gentry Arkansas Lamppost.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Lamppost in Downtown Gentry, Arkansas]]\nAs of 2010 the population of Gentry was 3,158.

The station is owned by [[Corus Entertainment]]. CKND-DT's studios are located on the 30th floor of [[201 Portage]] in [[downtown Winnipeg]], with transmitter atop the building. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] and [[MTS TV]] channel 12. On [[Shaw Direct]], it is carried on channels 335 (Classic) and 34 (Advanced). There is a [[high-definition television|high definition]] feed offered on Shaw Cable digital channel 211, MTS TV channel 1012, and Shaw Direct channels 27 (Classic) and 527 (Advanced).\n\n==History==\nThe station's history can be traced back to 1959, where the establishment of its predecessor, [[KCND-TV]], was announced on February 20. It went on the air in [[Pembina, North Dakota]] on channel 12 in November 1960. However, the station depended almost entirely on advertising from Winnipeg. In February 1973, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) announced that it had received two applications to start a new television station in Winnipeg. One application had been submitted by [[Craig Wireless|Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd]]., the parent company of [[CKX-TV]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]]. The other application had been received from Continental Communications Ltd. of Vancouver, represented by Ray Peters, the president of Vancouver [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] affiliate [[CHAN-DT|CHAN-TV]].<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Financial Post | date = February 17, 1973}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, [[Peter Liba]], who was then the executive assistant to [[Manitoba Liberal Party]] leader [[Izzy Asper]], spotted the advertisement from the CRTC soliciting competing applications for the new Winnipeg television licence. Liba suggested that he and Asper make a bid.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.canada.com/national/features/asper/story.html?id=343e1000-a0f2-45f1-8572-8bf21a75968b | accessdate=2010-12-30 | title=A true original | publisher=CanWest News Service | first=Randy | last=Boswell | date=October 2003 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829200617/http://www2.canada.com/national/features/asper/story.html?id=343e1000-a0f2-45f1-8572-8bf21a75968b | archive-date=2012-08-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Wanting to save money on buying the needed equipment, Asper decided to use KCND's assets to build his planned station. Asper flew to [[Texas]] and back many times over the next few months to convince KCND's owner, [[Gordon McLendon]], to sell the station's assets. He finally convinced McLendon that a new Winnipeg station would likely hurt KCND, since Winnipeg advertisers would probably no longer be allowed to deduct their American advertising costs from their taxes for much longer.\n\nMcLendon sold the station's facilities and equipment to [[Canwest|Canwest Broadcasting]], established by Asper and partners Paul Morton and Seymour Epstein, for $780,000, contingent on Canwest securing a broadcasting licence. At the CRTC's public hearings in Winnipeg in May 1974, Canwest noted that the acquisition of KCND would give their new Winnipeg station a $2 million advertising base and would save $1.5 million in capital and start-up costs compared to the alternative of launching a completely new station.<ref name=\"WinnipegFreePress\">{{cite news|url=|title=KCND Outlet Eyed|last=Lee|first=David|date=May 16, 1974|work=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=|page=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the same hearing, competing applications were presented by Communications Winnipeg Co-Op, which proposed a member-supported non-commercial station, and Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd. which, like Canwest, proposed an independent commercial station. (Continental Communications had withdrawn its application prior to the public hearings.) John Boler, the owner of [[Valley City, North Dakota|Valley City]]\u2013[[Fargo, North Dakota]] CBS affiliate [[KRDK-TV|KXJB-TV]] and future owner of [[KVRR]]/KNRR, also used the occasion to announce his intention to launch a new Pembina-based station on channel 12.<ref name=\"WinnipegFreePress\"/>\n\nIn September 1974, the CRTC awarded the Winnipeg channel 9 licence to Canwest, which formally took possession and assumed day-to-day management of KCND-TV on March 31, 1975 (due to foreign ownership restrictions, the McLendon Corporation remained the official licensee of KCND until it surrendered the station's broadcasting licence to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] [FCC] later that same year). The same month, Canwest confirmed that the new station would operate from a former supermarket at 603 St. Mary's Road in Winnipeg and use an antenna mounted on the [[CBWT-DT|CBWT]] tower in [[Starbuck, Manitoba|Starbuck]] to avoid having to dismantle KCND's tower during the transition.<ref>{{cite news | title = 1st TV Independent Goes On Air Sept. 1 | publisher = Winnipeg Free Press | date = March 15, 1975}}</ref> In May 1975, Canwest announced that KCND's 17 Winnipeg-based employees had all accepted offers of employment at the new station, but that there was little interest among the station's 22 Pembina-based employees.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadians promised jobs|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=May 28, 1975}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CKND good white.png|thumb|left|175px|The CKND ribbon logo was used for about 20 years from 1975\u20131994.]]\nDuring [[Labor Day|Labour Day]] weekend, on August 31, 1975, CKND signed on channel 9 (broadcast) and channel 12 (cable), both shown prominently in the station's logo.

(Craig) for a new television station at [[Portage la Prairie]], Canwest said that the Westman transmitter on a VHF channel would reach up to 175,000 more viewers than with the CKND-TV Winnipeg signal. The signal would stretch from the U.S. border to [[Dauphin, Manitoba|Dauphin]], and from Central Manitoba to Saskatchewan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=CKX scrambles CRTC reception with mid-stride plan change|last=McKinley|first=Patrick|date=June 18, 1981|work=Brandon Sun|access-date=|page=2}}</ref>\n\nAt an April 1982 CRTC hearing regarding licensing a new television station for southern Manitoba, Canwest stated that while they were given VHF channel 2 to operate the CKND-TV2 rebroadcaster, they could have used VHF channel 13 instead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Dogfight resumes for lucrative VHF channel|last=Aggerholm|first=Barbara|date=April 22, 1982|work=Brandon Sun|access-date=|page=2}}</ref> Canwest also stated that it would require a population of over 100,000 to serve the Interlake area with two or three UHF transmitters, rather than the 30,000 that existed at the time.\n\nOn air signal testing on channel 2 with colour bars, test slides and test programming began in early August.

Canadian cable providers were prohibited from distributing the signal, however, by an October 1986 CRTC decision in response to broadcaster concerns about the \"potentially damaging effect of this station by providing Canadian advertisers with access to large amounts of commercial airtime at rates substantially lower than those they would be obliged to pay Canadian television licensees in order to reach the same potential audience.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1986/DB86-1006.htm | accessdate=2010-12-30 | title=Decision CRTC 86-1006 | publisher=Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission |date=October 1986 }}</ref> As the satellite station was never profitable due to its location, as well as its difficulties in being able to reach the Winnipeg audience, KNRR went off the air from June to October 2009 as the station did not upgrade to a digital signal.\n\nAlong with the other Canwest-owned stations, CKND was rebranded as Global in the fall of 1997. CKND's studios also produced ''[[Fox Soccer Report]]'', which aired throughout the world on [[Fox Sports World Canada]], [[Fox Soccer Channel]], and Fox Sports Middle East. On September 1, 2008, CKND moved its operations downtown to Canwest Place (now called [[201 Portage]]).\n\nOn April 1, 2016, [[Shaw Media]] (which was rebranded from Canwest in 2010) was sold to [[Corus Entertainment]], giving CKND [[CJOB|three]] [[CFPG-FM|radio]] [[CJKR-FM|stations]] as sister properties.\n\n==News operation==\nCKND-DT presently broadcasts 24\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 4\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). On November 14, 2009, the station introduced a weekend evening 10 p.m. newscast. In December 2009, longtime anchor Eva Kovacs announced that she would be leaving CKND after nearly twelve years with the station, to work for the [[Winnipeg Regional Health Authority]] in 2010. Her last day was December 18, 2009 and Shannon Martin was named as her replacement. Her departure came only a few months after lead weather anchor [[Andrea Slobodian]] and reporter Meera Bahadoosingh left for [[Shaw TV Calgary]] and [[Shaw TV Winnipeg|Winnipeg]] respectively, and nightwatch reporter/anchor Trina Maus left for [[CKVR-DT|CKVR-TV]] in [[Barrie|Barrie, Ontario]].\n\nThe spring and summer of 2011 brought a few high-profile departures to the station; first weekend anchor and reporter Nicole Dube left to become the Manitoba correspondent for [[Sun News Network]]. Next Dube's replacement; Lindsay Warner left the station to become the late night anchor at [[CKY-DT]], lead weather anchor Craig Larkins left for [[CFRN-DT]] [[Edmonton]] in July, and in late August it was announced that senior anchor Shannon Martin would also be leaving to pursue her career in [[Ontario]]. Her last broadcast was September 2, 2011.

The station is owned by [[Corus Entertainment]]. CKND-DT's studios are located on the 30th floor of [[201 Portage]] in [[downtown Winnipeg]], with transmitter atop the building. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] and [[MTS TV]] channel 12. On [[Shaw Direct]], it is carried on channels 335 (Classic) and 34 (Advanced). There is a [[high-definition television|high definition]] feed offered on Shaw Cable digital channel 211, MTS TV channel 1012, and Shaw Direct channels 27 (Classic) and 527 (Advanced).\n\n==History==\nThe station's history can be traced back to 1959, where the establishment of its predecessor, [[KCND-TV]], was announced on February 20. It went on the air in [[Pembina, North Dakota]] on channel 12 in November 1960. However, the station depended almost entirely on advertising from Winnipeg. In February 1973, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) announced that it had received two applications to start a new television station in Winnipeg. One application had been submitted by [[Craig Wireless|Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd]]., the parent company of [[CKX-TV]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]]. The other application had been received from Continental Communications Ltd. of Vancouver, represented by Ray Peters, the president of Vancouver [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] affiliate [[CHAN-DT|CHAN-TV]].<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Financial Post | date = February 17, 1973}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, [[Peter Liba]], who was then the executive assistant to [[Manitoba Liberal Party]] leader [[Izzy Asper]], spotted the advertisement from the CRTC soliciting competing applications for the new Winnipeg television licence. Liba suggested that he and Asper make a bid.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www2.canada.com/national/features/asper/story.html?id=343e1000-a0f2-45f1-8572-8bf21a75968b | accessdate=2010-12-30 | title=A true original | publisher=CanWest News Service | first=Randy | last=Boswell | date=October 2003 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829200617/http://www2.canada.com/national/features/asper/story.html?id=343e1000-a0f2-45f1-8572-8bf21a75968b | archive-date=2012-08-29 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Wanting to save money on buying the needed equipment, Asper decided to use KCND's assets to build his planned station. Asper flew to [[Texas]] and back many times over the next few months to convince KCND's owner, [[Gordon McLendon]], to sell the station's assets. He finally convinced McLendon that a new Winnipeg station would likely hurt KCND, since Winnipeg advertisers would probably no longer be allowed to deduct their American advertising costs from their taxes for much longer.\n\nMcLendon sold the station's facilities and equipment to [[Canwest|Canwest Broadcasting]], established by Asper and partners Paul Morton and Seymour Epstein, for $780,000, contingent on Canwest securing a broadcasting licence. At the CRTC's public hearings in Winnipeg in May 1974, Canwest noted that the acquisition of KCND would give their new Winnipeg station a $2 million advertising base and would save $1.5 million in capital and start-up costs compared to the alternative of launching a completely new station.<ref name=\"WinnipegFreePress\">{{cite news|url=|title=KCND Outlet Eyed|last=Lee|first=David|date=May 16, 1974|work=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=|page=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the same hearing, competing applications were presented by Communications Winnipeg Co-Op, which proposed a member-supported non-commercial station, and Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd. which, like Canwest, proposed an independent commercial station. (Continental Communications had withdrawn its application prior to the public hearings.) John Boler, the owner of [[Valley City, North Dakota|Valley City]]\u2013[[Fargo, North Dakota]] CBS affiliate [[KRDK-TV|KXJB-TV]] and future owner of [[KVRR]]/KNRR, also used the occasion to announce his intention to launch a new Pembina-based station on channel 12.<ref name=\"WinnipegFreePress\"/>\n\nIn September 1974, the CRTC awarded the Winnipeg channel 9 licence to Canwest, which formally took possession and assumed day-to-day management of KCND-TV on March 31, 1975 (due to foreign ownership restrictions, the McLendon Corporation remained the official licensee of KCND until it surrendered the station's broadcasting licence to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] [FCC] later that same year). The same month, Canwest confirmed that the new station would operate from a former supermarket at 603 St. Mary's Road in Winnipeg and use an antenna mounted on the [[CBWT-DT|CBWT]] tower in [[Starbuck, Manitoba|Starbuck]] to avoid having to dismantle KCND's tower during the transition.<ref>{{cite news | title = 1st TV Independent Goes On Air Sept. 1 | publisher = Winnipeg Free Press | date = March 15, 1975}}</ref> In May 1975, Canwest announced that KCND's 17 Winnipeg-based employees had all accepted offers of employment at the new station, but that there was little interest among the station's 22 Pembina-based employees.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadians promised jobs|publisher=Winnipeg Free Press|date=May 28, 1975}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CKND good white.png|thumb|left|175px|The CKND ribbon logo was used for about 20 years from 1975\u20131994.]]\nDuring [[Labor Day|Labour Day]] weekend, on August 31, 1975, CKND signed on channel 9 (broadcast) and channel 12 (cable), both shown prominently in the station's logo.

Canadian cable providers were prohibited from distributing the signal, however, by an October 1986 CRTC decision in response to broadcaster concerns about the \"potentially damaging effect of this station by providing Canadian advertisers with access to large amounts of commercial airtime at rates substantially lower than those they would be obliged to pay Canadian television licensees in order to reach the same potential audience.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1986/DB86-1006.htm | accessdate=2010-12-30 | title=Decision CRTC 86-1006 | publisher=Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission |date=October 1986 }}</ref> As the satellite station was never profitable due to its location, as well as its difficulties in being able to reach the Winnipeg audience, KNRR went off the air from June to October 2009 as the station did not upgrade to a digital signal.\n\nAlong with the other Canwest-owned stations, CKND was rebranded as Global in the fall of 1997. CKND's studios also produced ''[[Fox Soccer Report]]'', which aired throughout the world on [[Fox Sports World Canada]], [[Fox Soccer Channel]], and Fox Sports Middle East.

In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]]. Orman{{sfn|Oman|1914|pp=409\u201310}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an independent [[France]] under its first king [[Charles the Bald]]; an independent Germany under its first king [[Louis the German]]; and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[Low Countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

[[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nCharlemagne kept his daughters at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women. Ed. Derek Baker. Oxford: Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978.</ref> Charlemagne's opposition to his daughters' marriages may possibly have intended to prevent the creation of [[cadet branch]]es of the family to challenge the main line, as had been the case with [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo of Bavaria]]. However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Italian campaigns==\n\n===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===\n[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore never to comply.

Lombard War}}\n\nThe siege lasted until the spring of 774 when Charlemagne visited the pope in Rome. There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city.

Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref> In the campaign of 769, Charlemagne seems to have followed a policy of \"overwhelming force\" and avoided a major pitched battle<ref>Bachrach, Bernard (2013). Charlemagne's Early Campaigns (768\u2013777): A Diplomatic and Military Analysis. Leiden: Brill. 2013, p. 234</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Diplomata Karolinorum I, 77ff.; title used from 801 onward.</ref> (\"Charles, most serene Augustus crowned by God, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire\") to the more direct ''Imperator Romanorum'' (\"Emperor of the Romans\").\n\nThe title of Emperor remained in the Carolingian family for years to come, but divisions of territory and in-fighting over supremacy of the Frankish state weakened its significance.{{sfn|Cantor|2015|pp=194\u201395, 212}} The papacy itself never forgot the title nor abandoned the right to bestow it. When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men.

Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law.

Carolus Magnus.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne in a copper engraving of the 16th-century by Giovanni Battista Cavalieri]]\n\nPart of Charlemagne's success as a warrior, an administrator and ruler can be traced to his admiration for learning and education. His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish Spain, Anglo-Saxon England,<ref>''Charlemagne and Anglo-Saxon England'', Joanna Story, ''Charlemagne: Empire and Society'', ed. Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests. He greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.\n\nCharlemagne was a lover of books, sometimes having them read to him during meals. He was thought to enjoy the works of [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\">{{cite journal |last=Bullough |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald A.

Due to the increased interest of intellectual pursuits and the urging of their king, the monks accomplished so much copying that almost every manuscript from that time was preserved. At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Italians]] [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; and Franks [[Angilbert]], Angilram, [[Einhard]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau]].\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [[liberal arts]] at court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he attempted to learn\u2014practising the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow\u2014\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his ability to read\u2014which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports\u2014has also been called into question.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his subjects.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne |title=Charlemagne |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date= 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 809\u2013810, Charlemagne called a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son).

[[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]], who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n===Political reforms===\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance while continuing many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The rise of the medieval world, 500\u20131300: a biographical dictionary|last=Schulman|first=Jana K.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0313011085|location=Westport, CN|page=xx}}</ref>\n\n====Divisio regnorum====\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy and [[Thuringia]]. To Pippin, he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]. Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

Looking at Charlemagne's life and personality, it becomes clear that he and Geoffrey's Arthur are practically twins.\"</ref> During the [[Hundred Years' War]] in the 14th century, there was considerable cultural conflict in England, where the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] rulers were aware of their French roots and identified with Charlemagne, Anglo-Saxon natives felt more affinity for Arthur, whose own legends were relatively primitive. Therefore, storytellers in England adapted legends of Charlemagne and his 12 Peers to the Arthurian tales.<ref>[http://www.mementomedievalia.com/charlemagne-king-arthur-and-contested-national-identity-in-english-romances/ Charlemagne, King Arthur and Contested National Identity in English Romances]<br /> Modelling his narrative on earlier Middle English texts, the English AMA-poet, appropriates aspects of the historical reality of Charlemagne and refashions them to fit Arthur, creating a hero that the English can claim as their own.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the spirit of Charlemagne appears to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)|Heaven of Mars]], among the other \"warriors of the faith\".<ref name=\"DLS17\">[[Dorothy L.

Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] and [[Pepin the Short]], the father of Charlemagne. In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]]. Orman{{sfn|Oman|1914|pp=409\u201310}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an independent [[France]] under its first king [[Charles the Bald]]; an independent Germany under its first king [[Louis the German]]; and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[Low Countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

The year given in the ''[[Annales Petaviani]]'', 747, would be more likely, except that it contradicts Einhard and a few other sources in making Charlemagne sixty-seven years old at his death.

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father.

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled.

Leiden: Brill. 2013, p. 234</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time.

The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law.

His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it.

Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests.

At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance.

Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.
