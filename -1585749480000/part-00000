Participants must be women born in 2000 or before. The race was won by [[Sanne Cant]] of [[Belgium]], winning her first title.\n\n==Race report==\nThe fastest starter was [[Ellen Van Loy]] who took the head start but did not manage to get away from the bunch. At the end of the first lap, eight riders were still within 6 seconds: [[Eva Lechner]], [[Marianne Vos]], [[Sanne Cant]], [[Kate\u0159ina Nash]], [[Lucinda Brand]], home rider [[Christine Majerus]], surprise Maghalie Rochette and Van Loy.\n\nVos, Cant and Brand opened up a gap and separated as a group; Vos tried several times to break away but Cant each time managed to close the gap with Brand trailing slightly. On the fourth of five laps, Cant slipped and lost about ten seconds, therefore Vos went into the final lap with eight seconds advantage. Meanwhile, Nash had come back from behind and was leading Brand by a few seconds for third place.\n\nOn the final lap, Vos' [[Bicycle chain|chain]] dropped, forcing her to step off the bike and manually put it back in place which allowed Cant to close the gap. The two battled it out on the slippery last half lap, overtaking each other several times. At the final real obstacle, a steep descent, Cant was able to overtake Vos and kept the lead onto the final straight, outsprinting Vos to take her first world title. Twenty seconds later, Nash outsprinted Brand for third place.\n\n==Results==\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Results > Women Elite|url=http://www.uci.ch/cyclo-cross/ucievents/2017-cyclo-cross-uci-cyclo-cross-world-championships/172478017/widgets/start-lists-results-181431/|work=2017 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships|publisher=UCI|accessdate=28 January 2017|date=28 January 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 4em;\"| Rank !!style=\"width: 20em;\"| Cyclist !!style=\"width: 5em;\"| Time\n|-\n| [[Image:gold medal icon.svg]]\n| {{flagathlete|[[Sanne Cant]]|BEL}}\n|align=\"right\"| 43' 06\"\n|-\n| [[Image:silver medal icon.svg]]\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marianne Vos]]|NED}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1\"\n|-\n| [[Image:bronze medal icon.svg]]\n| {{flagathlete|[[Kate\u0159ina Nash]]|CZE}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 21\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Lucinda Brand]]|NED}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 21\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Maghalie Rochette]]|CAN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 36\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eva Lechner]]|ITA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 53\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Christine Majerus]]|LUX}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1' 21\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Ellen Van Loy]]|BEL}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1' 25\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Nikki Brammeier]]|GBR}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1' 31\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Kaitlin Antonneau]]|USA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1' 46\"\n|-\n| 11\n| {{flagathlete|[[Elle Anderson]]|USA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 2' 29\"\n|-\n| 12\n| {{flagathlete|[[Caroline Mani]]|FRA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 2' 40\"\n|-\n| 13\n| {{flagathlete|[[Amanda Miller (cyclist)|Amanda Miller]]|USA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 2' 49\"\n|-\n| 14\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marlene Petit]]|FRA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 2' 53\"\n|-\n| 15\n| {{flagathlete|[[Courtenay McFadden]]|USA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 2' 53\"\n|-\n| 16\n| {{flagathlete|[[Helen Wyman]]|GBR}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 3' 06\"\n|-\n| 17\n| {{flagathlete|[[Alicia Franck]]|BEL}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 3' 12\"\n|-\n| 18\n| {{flagathlete|[[Lucie Chainel-Lef\u00e8vre|Lucie Chainel]]|FRA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 3' 19\"\n|-\n| 19\n| {{flagathlete|[[Luc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez Blanco]]|ESP}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 3' 29\"\n|-\n| 20\n| {{flagathlete|[[Mical Dyck]]|CAN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 4' 27\"\n|-\n| 21\n| {{flagathlete|[[Rebecca Fahringer]]|USA}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 4' 49\"\n|-\n| 22\n| {{flagathlete|[[Lise-marie Henzelin]]|SUI}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 5' 13\"\n|-\n| 23\n| {{flagathlete|[[Nathalie Lamborelle]]|LUX}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 5' 51\"\n|-\n| 24\n| {{flagathlete|[[Cindy Montambault]]|CAN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 6' 06\"\n|-\n| 25\n| {{flagathlete|[[Magdalena Sadlecka]]|POL}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 6' 30\"\n|-\n| 26\n| {{flagathlete|[[Jolien Verschueren]]|BEL}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 6' 36\"\n|-\n| 27\n| {{flagathlete|[[Hannah Payton]]|GBR}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 6' 40\"\n|-\n| 28\n| {{flagathlete|[[Stefanie Paul (cyclist)|Stefanie Paul]]|GER}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 8' 05\"\n|-\n| 29\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eri Yonamine]]|JPN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 8' 15\"\n|-\n| 31\n| {{flagathlete|[[Aida Nu\u00f1o Palacio]]|ESP}}\n|align=\"right\"| {{Tooltip|+ 1 lap|Rider finished one lap down}}\n|-\n| 32\n| {{flagathlete|[[Naomi Williams]]|AUS}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1 lap\n|-\n| 33\n| {{flagathlete|[[Rikke Lonne]]|DEN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1 lap\n|-\n| 34\n| {{flagathlete|[[Kristina Thrane]]|DEN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1 lap\n|-\n| 35\n| {{flagathlete|[[Waka Takeda]]|JPN}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 1 lap\n|-\n| 36\n| {{flagathlete|[[Rebecca Locke]]|AUS}}\n|align=\"right\"| {{Tooltip|+ 2 laps|Rider finished two laps down}}\n|-\n| 37\n| {{flagathlete|[[Suzie Godart]]|LUX}}\n|align=\"right\"| + 2 laps\n|-\n| \n| {{flagathlete|[[Katie Compton]]|USA}}\n| {{Tooltip|DNF5|Rider did not finish the fifth lap}}\n|-\n| \n| {{flagathlete|[[Loes Sels]]|BEL}}\n| DNF5\n|-\n| \n| {{flagathlete|[[Sophie de Boer]]|NED}}\n| {{Tooltip|DNF4|Rider did not finish the fourth lap}}\n|-\n| \n| {{flagathlete|[[Maud Kaptheijns]]|NED}}\n| {{Tooltip|DNF2|Rider did not finish the second lap}}\n|-\n| \n| {{flagathlete|[[Pavla Havl\u00edkov\u00e1]]|CZE}}\n| {{Tooltip|DNF1|Rider did not finish the first lap}}\n|-\n| \n| {{flagathlete|[[Alice Maria Arzuffi]]|ITA}}\n| DNF1\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://bieles2017.lu}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2017 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships -

He also spent 3 months in India studying [[kung fu]]. After his return he continued his training in parkour and filmed footage of his capabilities which he later turned into the famous ''Speed Air Man'' video. In 1997 the Stade 2 team (Francis Marroto, Pierre Sled and Pierre Salviac) were shown a video of Belle and decided to film a news feature about parkour.\n\nIn filming this news feature, the term [[Yamakasi]] was used for the first time in connection with the team. Belle did not approve of the name and felt like it did not give credit to his father, so he split from the group after the feature. Later Belle would go on to train other students who gave themselves the name 'tracer.' The spelling was later adapted to 'traceur', and has since been used to define a practitioner of parkour. However more recently, Belle claimed that \"A traceur is not a practitioner of parkour, a traceur is someone who is trying to understand parkour.\"\n\nBelle was first introduced to his acting career in a meeting with [[Hubert Kound\u00e9]] (''[[La Haine]]''), in order to discuss the success of parkour in cinema. He then began developing his acting ability with the play [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]], and has since been successful in obtaining a number of roles mostly in French films and promotions. Belle has been featured in promotional videos for Tina Turner, and Iam. He has starred in \"Les gens du voyages\" and \"Un monde meilleur\", followed by \"L'Engrenages\" and \"Femme Fatale\", as well as \"Les rivi\u00e8res pourpres 2\", starring [[Jean Reno]]. After filming several more advertisements and promotions for the BBC, Nissan, Canon, and Nike, Belle was contacted by [[Luc Besson]] (director of ''[[Nikita (film)|Nikita]]'', and ''[[The Fifth Element]]'') regarding co-starring as lead actor with [[Cyril Raffaelli]] in the action movie ''[[District 13]]'', followed by the sequel ''[[District 13: Ultimatum]]''. Belle co-starred with [[Paul Walker]] in ''[[Brick Mansions]]'' (2014), a remake of ''District 13''.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Filmography===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n!

He was a part of the group that later called themselves the Yamakasi, but the group chose the name Yamakasi during the filming of the Stade 2 news feature, credited as the first news feature about parkour. Belle was against the name and wanted to call the practice \"parkour\". He then split from the group after the feature because he felt that naming took away from the recognition of the discipline and its history.\n\n==See also==\n* [[S\u00e9bastien Foucan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb name|1042642}}\n* [http://la.ecitalent.com/biography/david-belle David Belle @ ECI Global Talent Management]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Parkour and Freerunning}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belle, David}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:French male film actors]]\n[[Category:French stunt performers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French people of Vietnamese descent]]\n[[Category:Parkour]]\n[[Category:Traceurs]]\n[[Category:People from F\u00e9camp]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{BLP sources|date=December 2010}}{{Infobox person\n| name               = David Belle\n| image              = David Belle NewYorker.jpg\n| image_size         = \n| caption            = Belle at the New Yorker Festival, 7 October 2007\n| birth_name         = \n| birth_date         = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1973|4|29}}\n| birth_place        = [[F\u00e9camp]], France\n| death_date         = \n| death_place        = \n| death_cause        = \n| resting_place      = \n| resting_place_coordinates = \n| residence          = \n| nationality        = French\n| other_names        = \n| known_for          = [[Parkour]], film ''[[District 13]]''\n| education          = \n| employer           = \n| occupation         = [[Actor]]<br />[[Choreographer]]<br />Traceur\n| title              = \n| salary             = \n| networth           = \n| height             = 1.79m\n| weight             = \n| term               = \n| party              = \n| boards             = \n| religion           = \n| spouse             = \n| partner            = \n| children           = \n| parents            = [[Raymond Belle]] (father)<br />Monique Kitten (mother)\n| relatives          = \n| signature          = \n| website            = [https://www.davidbelle.fr// DavidBelle.fr]\n| footnotes          = \n}}\n'''David Belle''' (born 29 April 1973) is a French actor, film choreographer and stunt coordinator.

Later in life, Belle spent time in the military and fire brigade with aspirations of following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps. He left soon after for personal reasons in order to dedicate himself to parkour.\n\nBelle later joined the [[Troupes de marine]] in [[Vannes]], where he received a promotion, a gymnastic agility certificate of honour, and champion records for regimental rope-climbing (which his father had once held) and the Essonne obstacle course. He has however said that his taste and love for adventure and freedom did not go well with the regimented life of the military.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.misterparkour.com/interview-with-david-belle/\n |title       = Interview with David Belle\n |publisher   = parkourpedia.com (Original French biography referenced to David-Belle.com which no longer exists)\n |quote       = ''Firstly, after being a fireman, I went into the army.

He also spent 3 months in India studying [[kung fu]]. After his return he continued his training in parkour and filmed footage of his capabilities which he later turned into the famous ''Speed Air Man'' video. In 1997 the Stade 2 team (Francis Marroto, Pierre Sled and Pierre Salviac) were shown a video of Belle and decided to film a news feature about parkour.\n\nIn filming this news feature, the term [[Yamakasi]] was used for the first time in connection with the team. Belle did not approve of the name and felt like it did not give credit to his father, so he split from the group after the feature. Later Belle would go on to train other students who gave themselves the name 'tracer.' The spelling was later adapted to 'traceur', and has since been used to define a practitioner of parkour. However more recently, Belle claimed that \"A traceur is not a practitioner of parkour, a traceur is someone who is trying to understand parkour.\"\n\nBelle was first introduced to his acting career in a meeting with [[Hubert Kound\u00e9]] (''[[La Haine]]''), in order to discuss the success of parkour in cinema. He then began developing his acting ability with the play [[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]], and has since been successful in obtaining a number of roles mostly in French films and promotions. Belle has been featured in promotional videos for Tina Turner, and Iam. He has starred in \"Les gens du voyages\" and \"Un monde meilleur\", followed by \"L'Engrenages\" and \"Femme Fatale\", as well as \"Les rivi\u00e8res pourpres 2\", starring [[Jean Reno]]. After filming several more advertisements and promotions for the BBC, Nissan, Canon, and Nike, Belle was contacted by [[Luc Besson]] (director of ''[[Nikita (film)|Nikita]]'', and ''[[The Fifth Element]]'') regarding co-starring as lead actor with [[Cyril Raffaelli]] in the action movie ''[[District 13]]'', followed by the sequel ''[[District 13: Ultimatum]]''. Belle co-starred with [[Paul Walker]] in ''[[Brick Mansions]]'' (2014), a remake of ''District 13''.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Filmography===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n!

His last major appearance was when he appeared as a guest at the New Yorker Festival in 2007. Belle was interviewed for the parkour article \"No Obstacles\" written by Alec Wilkinson which was published in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_wilkinson |title=No Obstacles | publisher=newyorker.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nBelle formerly endorsed the clothing company [[Take Flight, LLC|Take Flight]], but decided to sever his ties to the brand because he disapproved of their business activities and motives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbelle.com/fr/vetements.php |title=The Website of David Belle |publisher=DavidBelle.com |accessdate=4 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426015830/http://www.davidbelle.com/fr/vetements.php |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Parkour groups===\n* [[Les Traceurs]]\n** Belle was the leader of a group called \"Les traceurs\" which also included well known practitioner [[Stephane Vigroux]].

He was a part of the group that later called themselves the Yamakasi, but the group chose the name Yamakasi during the filming of the Stade 2 news feature, credited as the first news feature about parkour. Belle was against the name and wanted to call the practice \"parkour\". He then split from the group after the feature because he felt that naming took away from the recognition of the discipline and its history.\n\n==See also==\n* [[S\u00e9bastien Foucan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb name|1042642}}\n* [http://la.ecitalent.com/biography/david-belle David Belle @ ECI Global Talent Management]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Parkour and Freerunning}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belle, David}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:French male film actors]]\n[[Category:French stunt performers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French people of Vietnamese descent]]\n[[Category:Parkour]]\n[[Category:Traceurs]]\n[[Category:People from F\u00e9camp]]\n", "name_user": "14.232.203.56", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Th\u00eam n\u1ed9i dung: sinh ra t\u1ea1i Vietnam)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Belle"}

M thought that his was an important medium for public dissemination of Ramakrishna's ideas. M also sought [[Sarada Devi]]'s appraisal before the publication of the dairy.<ref name=\"sen-29-31\">{{Harvnb|Sen|2001|pp=29\u201331}}</ref> Between 1898 and 1902, [[transliteration|transliterated]] excerpts from his diary were published in leading Bengali journals like ''Bangadarshan'', ''[[Udbodhan]]'', ''Hindu Patrika'', ''Shaitya Patrika'' and ''[[Janmabhumi]]''.<ref name=\"sen-29-31\" /> The first four volumes were published in 1902, 1904, 1908 and 1910 respectively and the fifth volume in 1932, delayed because of M's health problems.<ref name=\"sen-46-47\"/> At the time of M's death in 1932, he was contemplating at least six to seven volumes after which he hoped to rearrange the entire material chronologically.<ref name=\"TV-12-14\"/><ref name=\"sen-46-47\">{{Harvnb|Sen|2001|pp=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Sumit Sarkar]],\"The ''Kathamrita'' was published from 15 to 50 years after the sessions with Ramakrishna, and covers a total of only 186 days spread over the last four and a half years of the saint's life. The full text of the original diary has never been made publicly available. Considered as a constructed 'text' rather than simply as a more-or-less authentic 'source', the ''Kathamrita'' reveals the presence of certain fairly self-conscious authorial strategies...The high degree of '[[illusory truth effect|truth effect]]' undeniably conveyed by the ''Kathamrita'' to 20th century readers is related to its display of testimonies to authenticity, careful listing of 'types of evidence', and meticulous references to exact dates and times.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1993|p=5}}</ref> [[Tyagananda]] and Vrajaprana write, \"...at the time of M' death, he had enough diary material for another five or six volumes. Poignantly and frustratingly, M's diary notations were as sparse as they were cryptic. As a result, M's ''Kathamrita'' project ended with the fifth volume. And, lest there be any misunderstanding, it needs to be said that the sketchy notations which constitute the reminder of M's diary belong solely to M's descendants, not to the [[Ramakrishna Order]].

The full text of the original diary has never been made publicly available. Considered as a constructed 'text' rather than simply as a more-or-less authentic 'source', the ''Kathamrita'' reveals the presence of certain fairly self-conscious authorial strategies...The high degree of '[[illusory truth effect|truth effect]]' undeniably conveyed by the ''Kathamrita'' to 20th century readers is related to its display of testimonies to authenticity, careful listing of 'types of evidence', and meticulous references to exact dates and times.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1993|p=5}}</ref> [[Tyagananda]] and Vrajaprana write, \"...at the time of M' death, he had enough diary material for another five or six volumes. Poignantly and frustratingly, M's diary notations were as sparse as they were cryptic. As a result, M's ''Kathamrita'' project ended with the fifth volume. And, lest there be any misunderstanding, it needs to be said that the sketchy notations which constitute the reminder of M's diary belong solely to M's descendants, not to the [[Ramakrishna Order]].

There is a belief that the town was once visited by Vishnu, who stayed there for some-time. In earlier times, the town was also known as Vanavasapura and, even earlier, when it was a small village, as Papanapalli.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOnce diwan Poornaiah who was traveling to Thirupathi, he visited Papanapalli. And asked the name of the town, then he said the above name was not so good, and it is also near to Tirupathi so he called the Papanapalli as \"Srinivaspur\" Srinivasa is the name of Lord Balaji of Thirupathi and pura is town.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nSrinivaspur is located at {{Coord|13.33|N|78.22|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Srinivasapura.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Srinivasapura]</ref> It has an average elevation of {{convert|819|m|ft}}.

It is {{convert|90|km|mi}} from [[Bangalore]].\n\nThere are no perennial rivers in the taluk but Kushavati stream, which is a tributary to the [[Papaghni river]], runs through it. There is gravelly soil in the area, which is suitable for growing [[Peanut|groundnut]], ragi and pulses. Tomato is also grown as a commercial crop.\n\nThe climate is dry and hot during summer. Average rainfall is {{convert|722|mm|in}},  which is slightly below the district average. On average, the taluk receives rain on 55 days per annum.\n\n== Politics ==\nThe taluk has 296 villages and is subdivided into five [[hobli]]s, being Srinivasapur, Ronur, Nelavanki, Rayalpad, Yeldur and Kurigepalli . Administration of the taluk is the responsibility of the [[taluk panchayat]], which in turn reports to the [[zilla panchayat]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n(A new entry may be created for Srinivaspur Vidhan Sabha Seat, and the following info can be transferred there.)\n\n===Vidhan Sabha Elections===\n(A new entry may be created for Srinivaspur Vidhan Sabha Seat, and the following info can be transferred there.)\nSrinivaspur assembly seat is part of Kolar Lok Sabha seat, as of 2019.

The film is set on the campus of Pacific Tech, a science and engineering university similar to [[Caltech]]. Chris Knight (Kilmer) is a genius in his senior year working on a [[chemical laser]]. Mitch Taylor (Jarret) is a new student on campus who is paired up with Knight to work on the project.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $12 million at the North American box office.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] is secretly developing \"Crossbow\", a [[space shuttle]]-mounted [[laser weapon]] precise enough to incinerate a single target from outer space, planning to use it for illegal political assassinations. However, they struggle with its power source, and have covertly hired Professor Jerry Hathaway at Pacific Technical University to develop this. Hathaway has assembled a group of brilliant physics students to do the work for him, though, outside of his graduate student Kent, purposely does not tell them the reason for their research. Hathaway is also embezzling the CIA provided funds intended for research so that he can upgrade his house.\n\nHathaway recruits high school student Mitch Taylor to attend Pacific Tech and join the \"laser weapon\" development team. Mitch is roomed with Chris Knight, also a member of the team, and known to Mitch as a \"legend\" in the fictitious \"National Physics Club\". Mitch becomes dismayed that Chris is more of a goof-off than a hard-working student. Chris introduces Mitch to some of the other exceptional students, including Jordan, \"Ick\" Ikagami, and his nemesis, the less intelligent Kent. Despite Mitch's age and inexperience, Hathaway assigns him to lead the team due to his innovative and original ideas in the field of laser physics, hoping that he will encourage Chris to straighten up his act, and that perhaps together, the two exceptionally bright minds will solve the crucial power problem that is the only remaining obstacle to completing the weapon.\n\nHathaway begins to be pressured by the CIA to hurry the project and is given a deadline, and he in turn assigns the team a rigorous timetable. Chris, however, continues his carefree attitude, eventually inviting Mitch to a pool party. Kent reports this to Hathaway, pulling him away from filming his television show. In front of Kent at the party, Hathaway lambastes Mitch, who in tears calls his parents and tells them he wants to go home (unaware that Kent and his friends were recording the call). The next day, Kent plays the recording over the school's public address system at lunch, humiliating Mitch. Mitch begins packing, now intent on leaving Pacific Tech, and Chris tries to reason with him as to why he should reconsider his decision by advising him on how to deal with the pressures and burdens of being highly intelligent and relating his own history and Lazlo's at Pacific Tech.  Lazlo, as a result of \"cracking\", dropped off the map apparently, and Chris felt that the same could happen to him or any other super-intelligent person unless they lighten-up and enjoy life ''in addition'' to devoting themselves to their work.  Mitch agrees to stay, and Chris suggests that their first priority is to exact revenge on Kent (by placing his car in his dorm room cycling the Citro\u00ebn's air suspension so it appears to be sleeping). \n\nAs the project is still lagging, the CIA continues to put pressure on Hathaway to produce the laser.  Hathaway, now intimidated and afraid, angrily informs Chris that he is no longer of any use to him and that he is not only off the project, but that he intends to fail Chris in his final course needed for graduation.  To further add insult to injury, he is giving a coveted \"after-graduation\" job, which was promised to Chris, to Kent instead and will take steps to ensure that Chris will never be able to find work in the field of laser physics. Now faced with his mentor having to leave in disgrace, Mitch uses the same logic and reasoning used by Chris on him to convince Chris to stay and persevere, and with help from Lazlo and their other smart friends, the two commit themselves to attain their goal with the laser and for Chris to pass Hathaway's final exam and graduate.  Their hard work and dedication begin to pay-off, and they are close to achieving their objective.  \nChris passes the exam, but in a final effort to humiliate and exact revenge on Chris and Mitch, Kent sabotages their latest apparatus, which showed the promise of succeeding, but inadvertently gives himself away as the perpetrator.  Unable to actually prove it was Kent, Chris is left to brood over the injustice, and in a moment of inspiration, he comes up with a whole new approach to the design problem. In the impressive demonstration of his innovative solution that follows, Hathaway relents and congratulates Chris and assures him that he will now graduate and get his promised job. The jubilant Chris and Mitch go out to celebrate their apparent success with their friends, blissfully unaware of the real reason for the creation of the laser. Lazlo unexpectedly arrives to join their celebration apparently, but actually was looking for them to tell them his theories and suspicions regarding the possible use of their unique design. They finally realize that they have been duped. By the time they return to the lab, all of the laser equipment, along with a mirror built by Kent for a target tracking system, has been taken by Hathaway and is already in the hands of the nefarious government agency who contracted the project.\n\nThe students are able to implant a radio transmitter in Kent's mouth, and Mitch uses it to speak to him through it making Kent believe Mitch is [[Jesus]]; Kent divulges the location of a nearby Air Force base where Hathaway will be demonstrating the equipment. Chris and Mitch sneak onto the base and reprogram the onboard computer to allow them to control it so Lazlo can reposition the target of the laser. Along with the rest of their team, they go to Dr. Hathaway's home and prepare something involving a small prism mirror on the outside of one of the windows and many boxes inside. They gather outside of the home to watch with one of the school's other professors and a Congressman. Kent, who was told by \"Jesus\" to go to the house but remain outside, arrives and goes inside. As the laser test begins, the changes cause the target to be Hathaway's house so it hits the mirror prism, heating and popping the large amount of popcorn inside. Before long, the house fills with popcorn, eventually causing it to burst at the seams, sending Kent out through the front door. Due to the laser hitting the wrong target, Hathaway investigates where the blast did go, only to find that it hit his house instead. Chris, Mitch, and the others look on at the popcorn mess in amusement as kids jump around in it like snow. Lazlo, who had entered a number of sweepstakes contests with calculated mathematical odds, arrives in his recently-won RV and other prizes with his lady love. At dusk, Hathaway arrives to see what has become of his house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Chris Knight\n* [[Gabriel Jarret]] as Mitch Taylor\n* [[Michelle Meyrink]] as Jordan Cochran\n* [[William Atherton]] as Prof. Jerry Hathaway\n* [[Robert Prescott (actor)|Robert Prescott]] as Kent\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Lazlo Hollyfeld\n* Mark Kamiyama as \"Ick\" Ikagami\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as David Decker\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as Major Carnagle\n* [[Patti D'Arbanville]] as Sherry Nugil\n* [[Severn Darden]] as Dr. Meredith\n* [[Beau Billingslea]] as George\n* [[Joanne Baron]] as Mrs. Taylor\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Mrs. Meredith\n* [[Dean Devlin]] as Milton\n* [[Yuji Okumoto]] as Fenton\n* [[Deborah Foreman]] as Susan Decker\n* [[Stacy Peralta]] as shuttle pilot\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nTo prepare for ''Real Genius'', Martha Coolidge spent months researching laser technology and the policies of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and interviewed dozens of students at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Attanasio | first=Paul | title=The Road to Hollywood: Director Martha Coolidge's Long Trek to ''Real Genius'' | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=August 7, 1985 | url= | accessdate=}}</ref> The screenplay was extensively rewritten, first by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]], later by Coolidge and Peter Torokvei.<ref>{{cite news | last=Attanasio | first=Paul | title=Fun With the Whiz Kids | work=[[Washington Post]] | date=August 7, 1985 | url= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nProducer [[Brian Grazer]] remembers that when Val Kilmer came in to audition for the role of Chris Knight, he brought candy bars and performed tricks.

First they used a ten-watt laser to pop a single kernel wrapped in aluminum foil, showing that popping corn is possible with a laser, then they tested a scaled-down model of a house. The popcorn was popped through [[induction heating]] because a sufficiently large laser was not available.

The film is set on the campus of Pacific Tech, a science and engineering university similar to [[Caltech]]. Chris Knight (Kilmer) is a genius in his senior year working on a [[chemical laser]]. Mitch Taylor (Jarret) is a new student on campus who is paired up with Knight to work on the project.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $12 million at the North American box office.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] is secretly developing \"Crossbow\", a [[space shuttle]]-mounted [[laser weapon]] precise enough to incinerate a single target from outer space, planning to use it for illegal political assassinations. However, they struggle with its power source, and have covertly hired Professor Jerry Hathaway at Pacific Technical University to develop this. Hathaway has assembled a group of brilliant physics students to do the work for him, though, outside of his graduate student Kent, purposely does not tell them the reason for their research. Hathaway is also embezzling the CIA provided funds intended for research so that he can upgrade his house.\n\nHathaway recruits high school student Mitch Taylor to attend Pacific Tech and join the \"laser weapon\" development team. Mitch is roomed with Chris Knight, also a member of the team, and known to Mitch as a \"legend\" in the fictitious \"National Physics Club\". Mitch becomes dismayed that Chris is more of a goof-off than a hard-working student. Chris introduces Mitch to some of the other exceptional students, including Jordan, \"Ick\" Ikagami, and his nemesis, the less intelligent Kent. Despite Mitch's age and inexperience, Hathaway assigns him to lead the team due to his innovative and original ideas in the field of laser physics, hoping that he will encourage Chris to straighten up his act, and that perhaps together, the two exceptionally bright minds will solve the crucial power problem that is the only remaining obstacle to completing the weapon.\n\nHathaway begins to be pressured by the CIA to hurry the project and is given a deadline, and he in turn, assigns the team a rigorous timetable. Chris, however continues his carefree attitude, eventually inviting Mitch to a pool party. Kent reports this to Hathaway, pulling him away from filming his television show. In front of Kent at the party, Hathaway lambastes Mitch who in tears calls his parents and tells them he wants to go home (unaware Kent and his friends were recording the call). The next day, Kent plays the recording over the school's public address system at lunch, humiliating Mitch. Mitch begins packing, now intent on leaving Pacific Tech, and Chris tries to reason with him as to why he should reconsider his decision by advising him on how to deal with the pressures and burdens of being highly intelligent and relating his own history and Lazlo's at Pacific Tech.  Lazlo, as a result of \"cracking\", dropped off the map apparently and Chris felt the same could happen to him or any other super-intelligent person unless they lighten-up and enjoy life ''in addition'' to devoting themselves to their work.  Mitch agrees to stay and Chris suggests that their first priority is to exact revenge on Kent (by placing his car in his dorm room cycling the Citro\u00ebn's air suspension so it appears to be sleeping). \n\nAs the project is still lagging, the CIA continues to put pressure on Hathaway to produce the laser.  Hathaway, now intimidated and afraid, angrily informs Chris that he is no longer of any use to him and that he is not only off the project, but that he intends to fail Chris in his final course needed for graduation.  To further add insult to injury, he is giving a coveted \"after-graduation\" job that was promised to Chris, to Kent instead and will take steps to ensure that Chris will never be able to find work in the field of laser physics.

First they used a ten-watt laser to pop a single kernel wrapped in aluminum foil, showing that popping corn is possible with a laser, then they tested a scaled-down model of a house. The popcorn was popped through [[induction heating]] because a sufficiently large laser was not available. The result was that the popcorn was unable to expand sufficiently to break glass, much less break open a door or move the house off its foundation. Instead, it ceased to expand and then simply [[char]]red.<ref name=\"mythbusters\">{{Cite episode |title=Car vs. Rain |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-02.html |accessdate=December 24, 2010 |series=MythBusters |serieslink=MythBusters |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |airdate=June 17, 2009 |season=2009 |number=11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307210633/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-02.html |archivedate=March 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIt was also specifically stated in the program that a five-megawatt laser still did not exist, even in military applications, and that the most powerful military laser they knew of was 100 kilowatts.<ref name=\"mythbusters\" />\n\nIn January 2011, it was further demonstrated on video<ref>{{Citation |last=Stevenson|first=Scott|title=Arctic Lasers Pop Popcorn - Pocket Blue Lasers Popping Popcorn|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii9A0ZJ5BbU}}</ref> in a home setting that a kernel of corn directly exposed to laser light from accessible consumer level lasers could be popped as reported by [[TechCrunch]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Burns|first=Matt|title=Popping Popcorn With Lasers Is Awesome And Healthy|date=Jan 14, 2011|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/14/popping-popcorn-with-lasers-is-awesome-and-healthy/}}</ref>\n\nThe solid xenon-halogen laser proposed and built by Chris in the latter half of the film, though in the realm of science fiction, was based on theory of the time.
