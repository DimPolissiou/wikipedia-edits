This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of [[East Prussia]] up to the [[Bug River]] where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet [[Red Army]] in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.\n\nThe [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet \"sphere of influence\" in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|this revised version]] of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of [[Lithuania]], which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.\n\n[[File:Mapa 2 paktu Ribbentrop-Mo\u0142otow.gif|thumb|German-Soviet border drawn-out in the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland]], signed in Moscow by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] during the Second [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] known as the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Frontier Treaty]] of September 28, 1939]]\n\nHitler decreed the direct annexation to the [[German Reich]] of [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|large parts]] of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich's [[Lebensraum]].<ref>''\"Erla\u00df des F\u00fchrers und Reichskanzlers \u00fcber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\"''</ref> Germany organized most of these areas as two new [[Reichsgau]]e: [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] triangle, became attached to adjacent [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]] of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO,{{Ref|a-RKF|[a]}} to facilitate the immediate [[Germanization]] of the annexed territory, typically resulting in [[Forced resettlement|mass expulsions]], especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German ''{{lang|de|Nebenland}}'' ([[March (territory)|March]], borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A F\u00fchrer's decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\n[[Hans Frank]] was appointed as the [[Governor-General]] of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied [[rump state]] that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.\n\nThe official name chosen for the new entity was the ''{{lang|de|Generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete}}'' (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the ''Generalgouvernement'' (General Government) by Frank's decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of [[German military administration in occupied Poland|military administration]] during the actual [[invasion of Poland]]) as an [[Military occupation|occupied territory]].<ref name=\"Majer265\">Majer (2003), p. 265.</ref> The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.\n\nOverall, 4&nbsp;million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50\u2013100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206246.pdf Generalgouvernement] Shoah Resource Center</ref> Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered.  Germans destroyed Warsaw after the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured [[Hans Frank]], who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. On October 1, 1946, he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]].

Later the plans were included into the Generalplan Ost. \nIn March 1941 Hans Frank informed his subordinates that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had made the decision to \"turn this region into a purely German area within 15\u201320 years\". He explained: \"Where 12&nbsp;million [[Poles]] now live, is to be populated by 4 to 5&nbsp;million [[Germans]].

Most of the Polish population was expelled by the Nazi occupation authorities with documented brutality. Himmler intended the city of [[Lublin]] to have a German population of 20% to 25% by the beginning of 1944, and of 30% to 40% by the following year, at which time Lublin was to be declared a German city and given a German mayor.<ref>Rich, Norman (1974).

Germany had [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|already annexed]] large parts of western pre-war Poland (8 October 1939) before the establishment of the General Government (26 October 1939), and the remaining region was also intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be directly incorporated into the German Reich at some future date. The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.\n\nThe earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate ''Reichsgau [[Beskids|Beskidenland]]'' which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), stretching from the area to the west of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to the [[San (river)|San river]] in the east.<ref>Burleigh, Michael (1988).

For the entire period of the General Government's existence there was only one General-Governor: Dr. Hans Frank. The [[NSDAP]] structure in General Gouvernment was ''Arbeitsbereich Generalgouvernement'' led by Frank.\n\nThe Office was headed by Chief of the Government ({{lang-de|Regierung|translation=government}}), also known as the State Secretary ({{lang-de|Staatssekret\u00e4r}}) (or Deputy Governor) [[Josef B\u00fchler]]. Several other individuals had powers to issue legislative decrees in addition to the General Governor, most notably the Higher [[SS and Police Leader]] of General Government ([[Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger]]; from October 1943: [[Wilhelm Koppe]]).\n\n[[File:Announcement of death of 100 of Polish hostages shot by Nazi-German authority in Poland 1941.jpg|thumb|upright|Announcement of the execution of 60 Polish hostages and a list of 40 new hostages taken by Nazi authorities in Poland, 1943]]\n\n[[File:General Government issued ID card for an administration worker.jpg|thumb|ID card for an administration worker \u2013 issued by the General Government]]\n\n{{quote|No government protectorate is anticipated for Poland, but a complete German administration.

The territories it administered were never either in whole or part intended as any future Polish state within a German-dominated Europe. According to the Nazi government the Polish state had effectively ceased to exist, in spite of the existence of a [[Polish government-in-exile]].<ref name=\"Majer2\"/> The General Government had the character of a type of [[colony|colonial state]]. It was not a Polish [[puppet government]], as there were no Polish representatives above the local administration.\n\nThe government seat of the General Government was located in Krak\u00f3w (German: ''{{lang|de|Krakau}}''; {{lang-en|Cracow}}) rather than in [[Warsaw]] for security reasons. The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the [[Blue Police]] and became subordinated to the [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the [[z\u0142oty]] currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.\n\nThe Germans sought to play [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and Poles off against each other. Within ethnic Ukrainian areas annexed by Germany, beginning in October 1939, Ukrainian Committees were established{{by whom|date=April 2019}} with the purpose of representing the Ukrainian community to the German authorities and assisting the approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled territories. These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. A Ukrainian publishing house was set up in Cracow, which \u2013 despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages \u2013 succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of [[Ukrainian literature]], and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members. Ukrainian organizations within the General Government were able to negotiate the release of 85,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war from the German-Polish conflict (although they were unable to help Soviet POWs of Ukrainian ethnicity).<ref>Myroslav Yurkevich.

At that time, the Polish court system was reinstated and made decisions in cases not concerning German interests, for which a parallel German court-system was established. The German system was given priority in cases of overlapping jurisdiction.\n\nNew laws were passed, discriminating against ethnic Poles and, in particular, the Jews. In 1941 a new [[criminal law]] was introduced, introducing many new crimes, and making the [[death penalty]] very common. The death penalty was introduced for, among other things:\n* on October 31, 1939, for any acts against the German government\n* on January 21, 1940, for economic speculation\n* on February 20, 1940, for spreading [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s\n* on July 31, 1940, for any Polish officers who did not register immediately with the German administration (to be taken to [[prisoner of war]] camps)\n* on November 10, 1941, for giving any assistance to Jews\n* on July 11, 1942, for farmers who failed to provide requested contingents of crops\n* on July 24, 1943, for not joining the forced labor battalions ([[Baudienst]]) when requested\n* on October 2, 1943, for impeding the [[German Reconstruction Plan]]\n\n===Policing===\nThe police in the General Government was divided into:\n\n* [[Ordnungspolizei]] (OrPo) (native German)\n* the [[Blue Police]] (Polish under German control)\n* [[Sicherheitspolizei]] (native German) composed of:\n** [[Kriminalpolizei]] (German)\n** [[Gestapo]] (German)\n\nThe most numerous [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|OrPo battalions]] focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force.

After the [[Operation Barbarossa]] against the Soviets in June 1941, East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (part of Poland, annected by [[Ukrainian SSR]] on the basis of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]]), was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district: [[District of Galicia|''Distrikt Galizien'']]. The new German administrative units were much larger than those organized by the Polish government, reflecting the German lack of sufficient administrative personnel to staff smaller units.<ref>Rich (1974), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe five districts were further sub-divided into urban counties (''Stadtkreise'') and rural counties (''Kreishauptmannschaften'').

Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.\n\nPoles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants.

If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the [[Barter|barter system]] (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). \"Introducing rationing in September 1940, [[Marshal Petain]] insisted that \u2018everyone must assume their share of common hardship.\u2019\"<ref name=\":1\" /> There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective. Cases, where a country was being occupied, caused the citizens to be more hesitant about the rationing of food and it was overall not as effective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=277\u2013279}}</ref> In December, 1941 it was recognized by the Generalgouvernement that starving the Jewish people to death was an inexpensive and expedient solution.

In the ghettos of eastern Europe in August 1941 the Jewish population recognized that if they were forced to remain in these ghettos they would eventually die of hunger.

Announced by Hitler on October 8, 1939, it claimed that the Polish government had totally collapsed. This rationale was utilized by the [[German Supreme Court]] to reassign the identity of all Polish nationals as [[statelessness|stateless subjects]], with the exception of the [[German diaspora|ethnic Germans]] of interwar Poland\u2014who, disregarding international law, were named the only rightful citizens of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Diemut2003\">{{cite book |title=\"Non-Germans\" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=JHU Press |work=With contribution from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |year=2003 |author=Diemut Majer |pages=236\u2013246 |isbn=0801864933 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_BCNrHG9K8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22Point%20of%20Departure%3A%20Statelessness%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe General Government was run by Germany as a separate administrative unit for logistical purposes.

This area extended from the 1939 eastern border of Germany proper and of [[East Prussia]] up to the [[Bug River]] where the German armies had halted their advance and linked up with the Soviet [[Red Army]] in accordance with their secret pact against Poland.\n\nThe [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] signed on 23 August 1939 had promised the vast territory between the Vistula and Bug rivers to the Soviet \"sphere of influence\" in divided Poland, while the two powers would have jointly ruled Warsaw. To settle the deviation from the original agreement, the German and Soviet representatives met again on September 28 to delineate a permanent border between the two countries. Under [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|this revised version]] of the pact the territory concerned was exchanged for the inclusion in the Soviet sphere of [[Lithuania]], which had originally fallen within the ambit of Germany. With the new agreement the entire central part of Poland, including the core ethnic area of the Poles, came under exclusively German control.\n\n[[File:Mapa 2 paktu Ribbentrop-Mo\u0142otow.gif|thumb|German-Soviet border drawn-out in the aftermath of the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland]], signed in Moscow by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] during the Second [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] known as the [[German-Soviet Frontier Treaty|Frontier Treaty]] of September 28, 1939]]\n\nHitler decreed the direct annexation to the [[German Reich]] of [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|large parts]] of the occupied Polish territory in the western half of the German zone, in order to increase the Reich's [[Lebensraum]].<ref>''\"Erla\u00df des F\u00fchrers und Reichskanzlers \u00fcber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\"''</ref> Germany organized most of these areas as two new [[Reichsgau]]e: [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia|Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]]. The remaining three regions, the so-called areas of Zichenau, Eastern [[Upper Silesia]] and the [[Suwa\u0142ki]] triangle, became attached to adjacent [[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]] of Germany. Draconian measures were introduced by both RKF and HTO,{{Ref|a-RKF|[a]}} to facilitate the immediate [[Germanization]] of the annexed territory, typically resulting in [[Forced resettlement|mass expulsions]], especially in the Warthegau. The remaining parts of the former Poland were to become a German ''{{lang|de|Nebenland}}'' ([[March (territory)|March]], borderland) as a frontier post of German rule in the east. A F\u00fchrer's decree of October 12, 1939 established the General Government; the decree came into force on October 26, 1939.<ref name=\"Diemut2003\"/>\n\n[[Hans Frank]] was appointed as the [[Governor-General]] of the General Government. German authorities made a sharp contrast between the new Reich territory and a supposedly occupied [[rump state]] that could serve as a bargaining chip with the Western powers. The Germans established a closed border between the two German zones to heighten the difficulty of cross-frontier communication between the different segments of the Polish population.\n\nThe official name chosen for the new entity was the ''{{lang|de|Generalgouvernement f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete}}'' (General Government for the Occupied Polish Territories), then changed to the ''Generalgouvernement'' (General Government) by Frank's decree of July 31, 1940. However, this name did not imply anything about the actual nature of the administration. The German authorities never regarded these Polish lands (apart from the short period of [[German military administration in occupied Poland|military administration]] during the actual [[invasion of Poland]]) as an [[Military occupation|occupied territory]].<ref name=\"Majer265\">Majer (2003), p. 265.</ref> The Nazis considered the Polish state to have effectively ceased to exist with its defeat in the September campaign.\n\nOverall, 4&nbsp;million of the 1939 population of the General Government area had lost their lives by the time the Soviet armed forces entered the area in late 1944. If the Polish underground killed a German, 50\u2013100 Poles were executed by German police as a punishment and as a warning to other Poles.<ref>[http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206246.pdf Generalgouvernement] Shoah Resource Center</ref> Most of the Jews, perhaps as many as two million, had also been rounded up and murdered.  Germans destroyed Warsaw after the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. As the Soviets advanced through Poland in late 1944 the General Government collapsed. American troops captured [[Hans Frank]], who had governed the region, in May 1945; he became one of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. During his trial he resumed his childhood practice of Catholicism and expressed repentance. Frank surrendered forty volumes of his diaries to the Tribunal; much evidence against him and others was gathered from them. He was found guilty of [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. On October 1, 1946, he was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]]. The sentence was carried out on October 16.\n\n==German intentions regarding the region==\n{{Further|Generalplan Ost|Lebensraum|Wehrbauer}}\n\nThe destruction of Warsaw and construction of a new German town was [[Pabst Plan|planned]] before the war and during the occupation. Later the plans were included into the Generalplan Ost. \nIn March 1941 Hans Frank informed his subordinates that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had made the decision to \"turn this region into a purely German area within 15\u201320 years\". He explained: \"Where 12&nbsp;million [[Poles]] now live, is to be populated by 4 to 5&nbsp;million [[Germans]]. The ''Generalgouvernement'' must become as German as the [[Rhineland]].\"<ref name=\"Germany\"/> By 1942 Hitler and Frank had agreed that the Krak\u00f3w (\"with its purely German capital\") and Lublin districts would be the first areas for German colonists to re-populate.<ref name=\"talk\">Hitler, Adolf (2000).

Germany had [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|already annexed]] large parts of western pre-war Poland (8 October 1939) before the establishment of the General Government (26 October 1939), and the remaining region was also intended{{by whom|date=November 2015}} to be directly incorporated into the German Reich at some future date. The Nazi leadership discussed numerous initiatives with this aim.\n\nThe earliest such proposal (October/November 1939) called for the establishment of a separate ''Reichsgau [[Beskids|Beskidenland]]'' which would encompass several southern sections of the Polish territories conquered in 1939 (around 18,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), stretching from the area to the west of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to the [[San (river)|San river]] in the east.<ref>Burleigh, Michael (1988).

For the entire period of the General Government's existence there was only one General-Governor: Dr. Hans Frank. The [[NSDAP]] structure in General Gouvernment was ''Arbeitsbereich Generalgouvernement'' led by Frank.\n\nThe Office was headed by Chief of the Government ({{lang-de|Regierung|translation=government}}), also known as the State Secretary ({{lang-de|Staatssekret\u00e4r}}) (or Deputy Governor) [[Josef B\u00fchler]].

According to the Nazi government the Polish state had effectively ceased to exist, in spite of the existence of a [[Polish government-in-exile]].<ref name=\"Majer2\"/> The General Government had the character of a type of [[colony|colonial state]]. It was not a Polish [[puppet government]], as there were no Polish representatives above the local administration.\n\nThe government seat of the General Government was located in Krak\u00f3w (German: ''{{lang|de|Krakau}}''; {{lang-en|Cracow}}) rather than in [[Warsaw]] for security reasons. The official state language was German, although Polish continued in use by local government. Useful institutions of the old Polish state were retained for ease of administration. The Polish police, with no high-ranking Polish officers (they were arrested or demoted), was reorganised as the [[Blue Police]] and became subordinated to the [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The Polish educational system was similarly retained, but most higher institutions were closed. The Polish local administration was kept, subordinated to new German bosses. The Polish fiscal system, including the [[z\u0142oty]] currency, remained in use but with revenues going to the German state. A new bank was created; it issued new banknotes.\n\nThe Germans sought to play [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and Poles off against each other. Within ethnic Ukrainian areas annexed by Germany, beginning in October 1939, Ukrainian Committees were established{{by whom|date=April 2019}} with the purpose of representing the Ukrainian community to the German authorities and assisting the approximately 30,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled territories. These committees also undertook cultural and economic activities that had been banned by the previous Polish government. Schools, choirs, reading societies and theaters were opened, and twenty Ukrainian churches that had been closed by the Polish government reopened. A Ukrainian publishing house was set up in Cracow, which \u2013 despite having to struggle with German censors and paper shortages \u2013 succeeded in publishing school textbooks, classics of [[Ukrainian literature]], and the works of dissident Ukrainian writers from the Soviet Union. By March 1941, there were 808 Ukrainian educational societies with 46,000 members. Ukrainian organizations within the General Government were able to negotiate the release of 85,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war from the German-Polish conflict (although they were unable to help Soviet POWs of Ukrainian ethnicity).<ref>Myroslav Yurkevich.

At that time, the Polish court system was reinstated and made decisions in cases not concerning German interests, for which a parallel German court-system was established. The German system was given priority in cases of overlapping jurisdiction.\n\nNew laws were passed, discriminating against ethnic Poles and, in particular, the Jews. In 1941 a new [[criminal law]] was introduced, introducing many new crimes, and making the [[death penalty]] very common. The death penalty was introduced for, among other things:\n* on October 31, 1939, for any acts against the German government\n* on January 21, 1940, for economic speculation\n* on February 20, 1940, for spreading [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s\n* on July 31, 1940, for any Polish officers who did not register immediately with the German administration (to be taken to [[prisoner of war]] camps)\n* on November 10, 1941, for giving any assistance to Jews\n* on July 11, 1942, for farmers who failed to provide requested contingents of crops\n* on July 24, 1943, for not joining the forced labor battalions ([[Baudienst]]) when requested\n* on October 2, 1943, for impeding the [[German Reconstruction Plan]]\n\n===Policing===\nThe police in the General Government was divided into:\n\n* [[Ordnungspolizei]] (OrPo) (native German)\n* the [[Blue Police]] (Polish under German control)\n* [[Sicherheitspolizei]] (native German) composed of:\n** [[Kriminalpolizei]] (German)\n** [[Gestapo]] (German)\n\nThe most numerous [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|OrPo battalions]] focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force.

These were the ''Distrikt [[Warsaw|Warschau]]'', the ''Distrikt [[Lublin]]'', the ''Distrikt [[Radom]]'', and the ''Distrikt [[Krak\u00f3w|Krakau]]''. After the [[Operation Barbarossa]] against the Soviets in June 1941, East [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (part of Poland, annected by [[Ukrainian SSR]] on the basis of the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]]), was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district: [[District of Galicia|''Distrikt Galizien'']]. The new German administrative units were much larger than those organized by the Polish government, reflecting the German lack of sufficient administrative personnel to staff smaller units.<ref>Rich (1974), p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe five districts were further sub-divided into urban counties (''Stadtkreise'') and rural counties (''Kreishauptmannschaften''). Following a decree on September 15, 1941, the names of most of the major cities (and their respective counties) were renamed based on historical German data or given germanified versions of their Polish and Soviet names if none existed. At times the previous names remained the same as well (i.e. Radom).

Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Rzeszowskiego. 2003. p.68.</ref> About 860,000 Poles and Jews were resettled into the General Government after they have been expelled from the territories 'annexed' by Nazi Germany. Offsetting this was the German genocidal campaign of liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia and other elements considered likely to resist. From 1941 disease and hunger also began to reduce the population.\n\nPoles were also deported in large numbers to work as forced labor in Germany: eventually about a million were deported, of whom many died in Germany. In 1940 the population was segregated into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation and restricted restaurants.

If the prices were set too high in cities there was a concern that workers would not be able to afford the food and protest the prices. Due to the price inflation which was occurring in the Generalgouvernement, many places relied on the [[Barter|barter system]] (exchanging goods for other goods instead of money). \"Introducing rationing in September 1940, [[Marshal Petain]] insisted that \u2018everyone must assume their share of common hardship.\u2019\"<ref name=\":1\" /> There was clearly food instability not only in the ghettos, but also in cities, which caused everyone to be conscious about food rationing, and caused conditions for Jewish people to worsen. While workers in Norway and France protested the new rationing of food, Germany and the UK, where the citizens supported war efforts were more supportive of the rationing therefore it was more effective. Cases, where a country was being occupied, caused the citizens to be more hesitant about the rationing of food and it was overall not as effective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe|last=Mazower|first=Mark|publisher=The Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9780713996814|location=London, UK|pages=277\u2013279}}</ref> In December, 1941 it was recognized by the Generalgouvernement that starving the Jewish people to death was an inexpensive and expedient solution.

The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]] (HPG axis) functions normally at birth and well into adult life, giving normal puberty and normal reproductive function. The HPG axis then either fails totally or is reduced to a very low level of GnRH release in adult life with no obvious cause (e.g. a pituitary tumour). This will lead to a fall in testosterone or oestrogen levels and infertility.<ref name=\"National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD)\"/><ref name=\"NIH Genetics Home Reference\">{{cite web|title=Kallmann syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kallmann-syndrome|website=National Institutes for Health.

Genetics Home Reference|access-date=December 17, 2017|date=December 2017}}</ref>\n\nFunctional hypothalamic amenorrhoea is seen in females where the HPG axis is suppressed in response to physical or psychological stress or malnutrition but is reversible with the removal of the stressor.<ref name=\"US Library of Medicine Genetics Home Reference\"/>\n\nSome cases of KS/HH appear to reverse during adult life where the HPG axis resumes its normal function and GnRH, LH, and FSH levels return to normal levels. This occurs in an estimated 10 to 22% of people, primarily normosmic CHH cases rather than KS cases and only found in people who have undergone some form of testosterone replacement therapy. It is only normally discovered when testicular volume increases while on testosterone treatment alone and testosterone levels return to normal when treatment is stopped. This type of KS/HH rarely occurs in cases where males have had a history of un-descended testes.<ref name=\"pmid:28476224\"/><ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nAffected individuals with KS and other forms of HH are almost invariably born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by [[placenta]] at approximately 12 to 20 weeks [[gestation]] (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Pediatric Endocrinology E-Book |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=136 |isbn=9781455759736}}</ref>\n\nPeople with KS/HH lack the surge of GnRH, LH, and FSH that normally occurs between birth and six months of age. This surge is particularly important in infant boys as it helps with testicular descent into the scrotum. The surge of GnRH/LH/FSH in non KS/HH children gives detectable levels of testosterone in boys and oestrogen and progesterone in girls. The lack of this surge can sometimes be used as a diagnostic tool if KS/HH is suspected in a newborn boy, but is not normally distinct enough for diagnosis in girls.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\n===Osteoporosis===\nOne possible side effect of having KS/CHH is the increased risk of developing secondary [[osteoporosis]] or [[osteopenia]]. Oestrogen (females) or testosterone (males) is essential for maintaining [[bone density]].<ref name=\"pmid9024272\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo CY, Jones TH, Eastell R | title = Treatment of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism effect on bone mineral density and bone turnover | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 658\u201365 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9024272 | doi = 10.1210/jc.82.2.658 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Deficiency in either testosterone or oestrogen can increase the rate of [[bone resorption]] while at the same time slowing down the rate of [[bone formation]]. Overall this can lead to weakened, fragile bones which have a higher tendency to fracture.\n\nEven a short time with low oestrogen or testosterone, as in cases of delayed diagnosis of KS/CHH can lead to an increased risk of developing osteoporosis but other risk factors, such as smoking are involved so the risk of developing it will vary from person to person. Bone density scans are recommended to monitor the bone mineral density.<ref name=\"National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD)\"/>\n\nThe bone density scan is known as a [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] scan (DEXA or DXA scan). It is a simple test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform.

The term isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) has increasingly been used to describe this group of conditions as it highlights the primary cause of these conditions and distinguishes them from other conditions such as [[Klinefelter syndrome]] or [[Turner syndrome]] which share some similar symptoms but have a different etiology.<ref name=\"pmid:21664415\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Au MG, Crowley WF, Buck CL | title = Genetic counseling for isolated GnRH deficiency | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 346 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 102\u20139 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21664415 | pmc = 3185214 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2011.05.041 }}</ref> The term hypogonadism describes a low level of circulating [[sex hormones]]; [[testosterone]] in males and [[oestrogen]] and [[progesterone]] in females. Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different mechanisms. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the [[gonadotropin]] hormones normally released by the [[anterior pituitary gland]] known as [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH).<ref name=\"pmid21511493\" /><ref name=\"pmid:26934720\"/> Failure in GnRH activity can otherwise be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurons inside the hypothalamus. HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions.\n\nIn the first 10 weeks of normal embryonic development, the GnRH releasing neurons migrate from their original source in the nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurons originate in an area of the developing head, the [[olfactory placode]], that will give rise to the olfactory epithelium; they then pass through the [[cribriform plate]], along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the [[rostral forebrain]]. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus. Any problems with the development of the olfactory nerve fibres will prevent the progression of the GnRH releasing neurons towards the brain.<ref name=\"pmid:20940512\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Teixeira L, Guimiot F, Dod\u00e9 C, Fallet-Bianco C, Millar RP, Delezoide AL, Hardelin JP | title = Defective migration of neuroendocrine GnRH cells in human arrhinencephalic conditions | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 120 | issue = 10 | pages = 3668\u201372 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20940512 | pmc = 2947242 | doi = 10.1172/JCI43699 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosing KS and other forms of CHH is complicated by the difficulties in distinguishing between a normal constitutional delay of puberty or a case of KS/CHH.<ref name=\"pmid:23207503\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pitteloud N | title = Managing delayed or altered puberty in boys | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue = Dec 3 | pages = e7913 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23207503 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e7913 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid:24836550\" /><ref name=\"pmid22392951\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Young J | title = Approach to the male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 707\u201318 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22392951 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-1664 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The diagnosis is often one of exclusion found during the workup of [[delayed puberty]].<ref name=\"Peter A.

The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]] (HPG axis) functions normally at birth and well into adult life, giving normal puberty and normal reproductive function. The HPG axis then either fails totally or is reduced to a very low level of GnRH release in adult life with no obvious cause (e.g. a pituitary tumour). This will lead to a fall in testosterone or oestrogen levels and infertility.<ref name=\"National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD)\"/><ref name=\"NIH Genetics Home Reference\">{{cite web|title=Kallmann syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kallmann-syndrome|website=National Institutes for Health.

This occurs in an estimated 10 to 22% of people, primarily normosmic CHH cases rather than KS cases and only found in people who have undergone some form of testosterone replacement therapy. It is only normally discovered when testicular volume increases while on testosterone treatment alone and testosterone levels return to normal when treatment is stopped. This type of KS/HH rarely occurs in cases where males have had a history of un-descended testes.<ref name=\"pmid:28476224\"/><ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nAffected individuals with KS and other forms of HH are almost invariably born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by [[placenta]] at approximately 12 to 20 weeks [[gestation]] (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Pediatric Endocrinology E-Book |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=136 |isbn=9781455759736}}</ref>\n\nPeople with KS/HH lack the surge of GnRH, LH, and FSH that normally occurs between birth and six months of age. This surge is particularly important in infant boys as it helps with testicular descent into the scrotum. The surge of GnRH/LH/FSH in non KS/HH children gives detectable levels of testosterone in boys and oestrogen and progesterone in girls. The lack of this surge can sometimes be used as a diagnostic tool if KS/HH is suspected in a newborn boy, but is not normally distinct enough for diagnosis in girls.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\n===Osteoporosis===\nOne possible side effect of having KS/CHH is the increased risk of developing secondary [[osteoporosis]] or [[osteopenia]].

The term isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) has increasingly been used to describe this group of conditions as it highlights the primary cause of these conditions and distinguishes them from other conditions such as [[Klinefelter syndrome]] or [[Turner syndrome]] which share some similar symptoms but have a different etiology.<ref name=\"pmid:21664415\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Au MG, Crowley WF, Buck CL | title = Genetic counseling for isolated GnRH deficiency | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 346 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 102\u20139 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21664415 | pmc = 3185214 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2011.05.041 }}</ref> The term hypogonadism describes a low level of circulating [[sex hormones]]; [[testosterone]] in males and [[oestrogen]] and [[progesterone]] in females. Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different mechanisms. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the [[gonadotropin]] hormones normally released by the [[anterior pituitary gland]] known as [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH).<ref name=\"pmid21511493\" /><ref name=\"pmid:26934720\"/> Failure in GnRH activity can otherwise be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurons inside the hypothalamus. HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions.\n\nIn the first 10 weeks of normal embryonic development, the GnRH releasing neurons migrate from their original source in the nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurons originate in an area of the developing head, the [[olfactory placode]], that will give rise to the olfactory epithelium; they then pass through the [[cribriform plate]], along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the [[rostral forebrain]]. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus. Any problems with the development of the olfactory nerve fibres will prevent the progression of the GnRH releasing neurons towards the brain.<ref name=\"pmid:20940512\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Teixeira L, Guimiot F, Dod\u00e9 C, Fallet-Bianco C, Millar RP, Delezoide AL, Hardelin JP | title = Defective migration of neuroendocrine GnRH cells in human arrhinencephalic conditions | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 120 | issue = 10 | pages = 3668\u201372 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20940512 | pmc = 2947242 | doi = 10.1172/JCI43699 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosing KS and other forms of CHH is complicated by the difficulties in distinguishing between a normal constitutional delay of puberty or a case of KS/CHH.<ref name=\"pmid:23207503\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pitteloud N | title = Managing delayed or altered puberty in boys | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue = Dec 3 | pages = e7913 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23207503 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e7913 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid:24836550\" /><ref name=\"pmid22392951\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Young J | title = Approach to the male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 707\u201318 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22392951 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-1664 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The diagnosis is often one of exclusion found during the workup of [[delayed puberty]].<ref name=\"Peter A.

The PSDI, before the 1990s decline in votes and members, had been an important force in [[politics of Italy|Italian politics]], being the longest serving partner in government for [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]. The party's founder and longstanding leader was [[Giuseppe Saragat]], who served as [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Italian Republic]] from 1964 to 1971.\n\n==History==\n\n===The years of the ''First Republic''===\nThe party was founded as the '''Socialist Party of Italian Workers''' (PSLI) in 1947 by a splinter group of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), due to the decision of the latter to join the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) in the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]'s electoral list for the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]].\n\nThe split, led by [[Giuseppe Saragat]] and the sons of [[Giacomo Matteotti]], took the name of ''Scissione di Palazzo Barberini'', from the name of a palace in Rome where it took place. On 1 May 1951 it joined forces with the smaller [[Unitary Socialist Party (Italy, 1949)|Unitary Socialist Party]] and took the name '''Socialist Party \u2013 Italian Section of the Socialist International''' (PS\u2013SIIS). On 7 January 1952 the PS\u2013SIIS was ultimately renamed \"Italian Democratic Socialist Party\" (PSDI).\n\nFrom 1949 to 1965 members of the PSDI held the presidency of the ''Istituto Nazionale di Previdenza Sociale'' (INPS).<ref>A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943\u20131988 by Paul Ginsborg</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the party joined the PSI to form the [[Unified Socialist Party (Italy)|Unified Socialist Party]], but in 1969, after a dismaying result at the [[1968 Italian general election|1968 general election]], it left the new unified party, taking the name '''Unitary Socialist Party''' (PSU). It returned to the PSDI name in 1971.\n\nIn 1980 the party joined [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], the Italian Socialist Party, the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Italian Liberal Party]] in the five-party coalition (''[[Pentapartito]]'') which ruled the country until 1994 (since 1991 without the Republicans). However the party's role in the coalition was minimal and was over-shadowed by the more powerful PSI.\n\nThe PSDI was a member of [[Socialist International]] and a founder member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES). Its [[Member of the European Parliament|members]] of the [[European Parliament]] thus sat within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialist Group]] since 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-1979.htm |title=Parlement Europ\u00e9en 1979|publisher=Europe-politique |accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-1984.htm |title=Parlement Europ\u00e9en 1984|publisher=Europe-politique|date=17 February 2007|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-1989.htm|title=Parlement Europ\u00e9en 1989|publisher=Europe-politique |accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> In 1994 the party was expelled from the PES.<ref name=\"CostaLoba Magalh\u00e3es2004\">{{cite book|author1=Marina Costa Loba|author2=Pedro C.

The [[1994 Italian general election|1994 general election]] resulted in an almost overnight decline of the ''Pentapartito'' coalition parties and the rise of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]-led [[Forza Italia]], which absorbed many PSDI voters. In January 1995 [[Gian Franco Schietroma]] was elected national secretary of the party replacing [[Enrico Ferri (politician)|Enrico Ferri]], who wanted to join the centre-right [[Pole of Freedoms]]. The followers of Ferri left and established the [[European Liberal Social Democracy]] and joined the centre-right [[Christian Democratic Centre]].\n\nIn 1998 the party, led by Schietroma, finally merged with the [[Italian Socialists]], one of the successor parties of the PSI, to form the [[Italian Democratic Socialists]]. By then most members and voters of the party have joined other parties: Forza Italia (as [[Carlo Vizzini]], party leader in 1992\u20131993), the [[Christian Democratic Centre]] (as Enrico Ferri, party leader in 1993\u20131995) and [[The Democrats (Italy)|The Democrats]] (as [[Franco Bruno]]).\n\nThe party was re-established in 2004 with the same name, \"[[Italian Democratic Socialist Party (2004)|Italian Democratic Socialist Party]]\", as the continuation of the party of Saragat, so that the new PSDI numbers its congresses in perfect continuity with the late PSDI.\n\n==Popular support==\n[[File:Giuseppe Saragat 1964.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Social Democratic leader [[Giuseppe Saragat]] in 1964.]]\nThe PSDI had its best result at its first appearance in the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]], when it gained 7.1% of the vote. In that occasion the party was successful in stealing many votes from the [[Italian Socialist Party]], which was damaged by the split as well as by the alliance with the [[Italian Communist Party]] in the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]. The PSDI found its heartlands in [[Northern Italy]]: 12.9% in the [[Province of Turin]], 11.9% in [[Province of Cuneo|Cuneo]], 10.6% in [[Province of Milan|Milan]], 13.9% in [[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]], 12.6% in [[Province of Treviso|Treviso]], 15.9% in [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]], and 14.9% in [[Province of Udine|Udine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/area.php?tp=C&dt=18/04/1948 |accessdate=16 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626005144/http://elezionistorico.interno.it/area.php?tp=C&dt=18%2F04%2F1948 |archivedate=26 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFrom [[1953 Italian general election|1953]] to [[1987 Italian general election|1987]] the party's support was around 4\u20135%, with the sole exception of [[1963 Italian general election|1963]], when it gained 6.1%. In the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]], the last before ''[[Tangentopoli]]'', the PSDI won just 2.7%. The party maintained for decades its strongholds in the North-West and North-East, but since the 1960s it started to gain support in [[Southern Italy]]. By [[1987 Italian general election|1987]] the party's strongholds had moved South, especially [[Apulia]], [[Campania]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tp=C|title=Ministero dell'Interno.

This was partly due to the growth of [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] parties in the North (united in [[Lega Nord]] since 1991).\n\nAfter ''Tangentopoli'', ''[[Mani pulite]]'' and subsequent political crisis, the PSDI has almost disappeared electorally, although it retains some support locally in the South, especially in Apulia.\n\nThe electoral results of PSDI in general ([[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]) and [[European Parliament]] elections since 1948 are shown in the chart below.\n\n{{Graph:Chart|width=560|type=rect|colors=#FF8282\n|xAxisTitle=Elections\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|x=Apr. 1948, Jun. 1953, May 1958, Apr. 1963, May 1968 (shared), May 1972, Jun. 1976, 3 Jun. 1979, 10 Jun. 1979, Jun. 1983, Jun. 1984, Jun. 1987, Jun. 1989, Apr. 1992, Mar. 1994, Jun. 1994\n|yAxisTitle=% of popular vote\n|y=7.7, 4.5, 4.6, 6.1, 7.2, 5.1, 3.4, 3.8, 4.3, 4.9, 2.5, 3.0, 2.7, 2.7, 0.5, 0.7}}\n\n==Electoral results==\n\n===Italian Parliament===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n| colspan=6|[[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]\n|-\n! width=13%|Election year\n! width=16%|Votes\n! width=6%|% \n! width=1%|Seats\n! width=8%|+/\u2212\n! width=19%|Leader\n|-\n!

The PSDI, before the 1990s decline in votes and members, had been an important force in [[politics of Italy|Italian politics]], being the longest serving partner in government for [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]. The party's founder and longstanding leader was [[Giuseppe Saragat]], who served as [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Italian Republic]] from 1964 to 1971.\n\n==History==\n\n===The years of the ''First Republic''===\nThe party was founded as the '''Socialist Party of Italian Workers''' (PSLI) in 1947 by a splinter group of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), due to the decision of the latter to join the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) in the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]'s electoral list for the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]].\n\nThe split, led by [[Giuseppe Saragat]] and the sons of [[Giacomo Matteotti]], took the name of ''Scissione di Palazzo Barberini'', from the name of a palace in Rome where it took place. On 1 May 1951 it joined forces with the smaller [[Unitary Socialist Party (Italy, 1949)|Unitary Socialist Party]] and took the name '''Socialist Party \u2013 Italian Section of the Socialist International''' (PS\u2013SIIS). On 7 January 1952 the PS\u2013SIIS was ultimately renamed \"Italian Democratic Socialist Party\" (PSDI).\n\nFrom 1949 to 1965 members of the PSDI held the presidency of the ''Istituto Nazionale di Previdenza Sociale'' (INPS).<ref>A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943\u20131988 by Paul Ginsborg</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the party joined the PSI to form the [[Unified Socialist Party (Italy)|Unified Socialist Party]], but in 1969, after a dismaying result at the [[1968 Italian general election|1968 general election]], it left the new unified party, taking the name '''Unitary Socialist Party''' (PSU). It returned to the PSDI name in 1971.\n\nIn 1980 the party joined [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], the Italian Socialist Party, the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Italian Liberal Party]] in the five-party coalition (''[[Pentapartito]]'') which ruled the country until 1994 (since 1991 without the Republicans). However the party's role in the coalition was minimal and was over-shadowed by the more powerful PSI.\n\nThe PSDI was a member of [[Socialist International]] and a founder member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES). Its [[Member of the European Parliament|members]] of the [[European Parliament]] thus sat within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialist Group]] since 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-1979.htm |title=Parlement Europ\u00e9en 1979|publisher=Europe-politique |accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-1984.htm |title=Parlement Europ\u00e9en 1984|publisher=Europe-politique|date=17 February 2007|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-1989.htm|title=Parlement Europ\u00e9en 1989|publisher=Europe-politique |accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> In 1994 the party was expelled from the PES.<ref name=\"CostaLoba Magalh\u00e3es2004\">{{cite book|author1=Marina Costa Loba|author2=Pedro C.

The [[1994 Italian general election|1994 general election]] resulted in an almost overnight decline of the ''Pentapartito'' coalition parties and the rise of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]-led [[Forza Italia]], which absorbed many PSDI voters. In January 1995 [[Gian Franco Schietroma]] was elected national secretary of the party replacing [[Enrico Ferri (politician)|Enrico Ferri]], who wanted to join the centre-right [[Pole of Freedoms]]. The followers of Ferri left and established the [[European Liberal Social Democracy]] and joined the centre-right [[Christian Democratic Centre]].\n\nIn 1998 the party, led by Schietroma, finally merged with the [[Italian Socialists]], one of the successor parties of the PSI, to form the [[Italian Democratic Socialists]]. By then most members and voters of the party have joined other parties: Forza Italia (as [[Carlo Vizzini]], party leader in 1992\u20131993), the [[Christian Democratic Centre]] (as Enrico Ferri, party leader in 1993\u20131995) and [[The Democrats (Italy)|The Democrats]] (as [[Franco Bruno]]).\n\nThe party was re-established in 2004 with the same name, \"[[Italian Democratic Socialist Party (2004)|Italian Democratic Socialist Party]]\", as the continuation of the party of Saragat, so that the new PSDI numbers its congresses in perfect continuity with the late PSDI.\n\n==Popular support==\n[[File:Giuseppe Saragat 1964.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Social Democratic leader [[Giuseppe Saragat]] in 1964.]]\nThe PSDI had its best result at its first appearance in the [[1948 Italian general election|1948 general election]], when it gained 7.1% of the vote. In that occasion the party was successful in stealing many votes from the [[Italian Socialist Party]], which was damaged by the split as well as by the alliance with the [[Italian Communist Party]] in the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]. The PSDI found its heartlands in [[Northern Italy]]: 12.9% in the [[Province of Turin]], 11.9% in [[Province of Cuneo|Cuneo]], 10.6% in [[Province of Milan|Milan]], 13.9% in [[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]], 12.6% in [[Province of Treviso|Treviso]], 15.9% in [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]], and 14.9% in [[Province of Udine|Udine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/area.php?tp=C&dt=18/04/1948 |accessdate=16 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626005144/http://elezionistorico.interno.it/area.php?tp=C&dt=18%2F04%2F1948 |archivedate=26 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFrom [[1953 Italian general election|1953]] to [[1987 Italian general election|1987]] the party's support was around 4\u20135%, with the sole exception of [[1963 Italian general election|1963]], when it gained 6.1%. In the [[1992 Italian general election|1992 general election]], the last before ''[[Tangentopoli]]'', the PSDI won just 2.7%. The party maintained for decades its strongholds in the North-West and North-East, but since the 1960s it started to gain support in [[Southern Italy]]. By [[1987 Italian general election|1987]] the party's strongholds had moved South, especially [[Apulia]], [[Campania]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tp=C|title=Ministero dell'Interno.

This was partly due to the growth of [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] parties in the North (united in [[Lega Nord]] since 1991).\n\nAfter ''Tangentopoli'', ''[[Mani pulite]]'' and subsequent political crisis, the PSDI has almost disappeared electorally, although it retains some support locally in the South, especially in Apulia.\n\nThe electoral results of PSDI in general ([[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]) and [[European Parliament]] elections since 1948 are shown in the chart below.\n\n{{Graph:Chart|width=560|type=rect|colors=#FF8282\n|xAxisTitle=Elections\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|x=Apr. 1948, Jun. 1953, May 1958, Apr. 1963, May 1968 (shared), May 1972, Jun. 1976, 3 Jun. 1979, 10 Jun. 1979, Jun. 1983, Jun. 1984, Jun. 1987, Jun. 1989, Apr. 1992, Mar. 1994, Jun. 1994\n|yAxisTitle=% of popular vote\n|y=7.7, 4.5, 4.6, 6.1, 7.2, 5.1, 3.4, 3.8, 4.3, 4.9, 2.5, 3.0, 2.7, 2.7, 0.5, 0.7}}\n\n==Electoral results==\n\n===Italian Parliament===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n| colspan=6|[[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]]\n|-\n! width=13%|Election year\n! width=16%|Votes\n! width=6%|% \n! width=1%|Seats\n! width=8%|+/\u2212\n! width=19%|Leader\n|-\n!

His career began as a scratch DJ in 1994, rapidly growing a cult fan base due to his virtuosic skills. Ever innovating, he quickly evolved into combining turntables with analog machines and visual storytelling devices to create his signature style. Kid Koala jumps effortlessly between genres as eclectic as hip hop, ambient, alternative, contemporary classical, blues, classic rock and traditional jazz. He has released 5 solo albums on Ninja Tune, and 3 albums on Arts & Crafts Records, the most recent being ''Music To Draw To: IO'' featuring Trixie Whitley. He has also released two award-winning graphic novels: ''Nufonia Must Fall'' and ''Space Cadet''. He has collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, The Slew, Lovage, and The Afiara String Quartet.\n\nKid Koala has toured with the likes of [[Radiohead]], [[the Beastie Boys]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Money Mark]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Mike Patton]], [[DJ Shadow]], and [[The Preservation Hall Jazz Band]]. He has contributed to scores for the films The Great Gatsby, Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Men Women and Children, Shaun of the Dead and Looper amongst others. He has composed music for The National Film Board of Canada, the Cartoon Network, Sesame Street and Adult Swim. He has also been commissioned to create music for runway shows for Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten. \n\nKid Koala\u2019s unforgettable live shows range from touring turntable carnivals like Vinyl Vaudeville, to immersive multimedia shows like Nufonia Must Fall, The Storyville Mosquito, Satellite Turntable Orchestra and his Space Cadet Headphone Concert; each of which express his unique form of storytelling with music, animation, film and interactive entertainment.\n\nKid Koala has toured 6 continents and lives with his wife and two daughters in Montreal, Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan attended [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]], in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], U.S., and went on to study elementary education at [[McGill University]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>Bryant, Luke. \"The new faces of music: Kid Koala's got all the technical moves but more important, he's making new music\" The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia), March 20, 2004, Pg. D3</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSan began by distributing copies of his demo tape ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' to students living in residence at McGill. He is well known for his enigmatic style of [[turntablism]], which uses an unusual collection of samples. He has used samples of music from [[Charlie Brown]] television specials, old comedy sketch routines (including those that mock turntablism), people [[sneezing]], and people reading a menu in [[Cantonese]]. \n\nIn 2000, San released his album, ''Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''. He designed and illustrated the cover for this and his later albums. A comic book he drew is included as the liner notes. Following the release of the album, Kid Koala embarked on an extensive tour, during which he opened for a number of musicians, including [[Radiohead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=8 |title=Ninja / Ninja Tune |website=Ninjatune.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031006041300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1317575|title=BBC - collective - kid koala interview - A1317575|date=6 October 2003|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> The [[cabaret]]-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as ''[[The Short Attention Span Theatre]]'', featured an unpredictable opening act\u2014three Djs (Kid Koala, [[P-Love]], and [[DJ Jester the Filipino Fist]]) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on a new book and a multimedia puppet show.\n\nSan released a full length graphic novel, ''[[Nufonia Must Fall]]'', which includes a soundtrack CD he composed. ''Some of my Best Friends are DJs'' includes a [[chess]] set as part of the packaging. \n\nSan popularized a method of playing the turntable like a melodic instrument, where a long, single note is dragged under the needle at different speeds, creating different pitches. Since this method of adjusting pitch is imprecise, the resulting notes waver and bend. Thus, in the song \"Drunk Trumpet,\" San uses this method with a trumpet note to simulate a drunken trumpet player, interspersing drunken vocals to complete the effect. When playing live, San often uses records cut with custom sounds from which he creates his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistxite.com/us/magazine/interviews/98385/Interview-with-Kid-Koala-I-consider-myself-one-of-the-worst-DJs-in-the-world.html|title=Interview with Kid Koala : \"I consider myself one of the worst DJs in the world!\"|website=Artistxite.com|accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nDuring San Diego [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2010, Kid Koala performed before a special free showing of the movie ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]''. The next year at Comic-Con, he performed before a special premiere of the television series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]''.\n\nIn June 2013, his studio album ''12 bit Blues'' was longlisted for the [[2013 Polaris Music Prize]].\n\nIn June 2014, the ''[[Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live]]'' made its world premiere at Toronto's Luminato Festival.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412125243/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/nufonia|title=Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live - Luminato Festival 2014|date=12 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> Directed by K.K.

His career began as a scratch DJ in 1994, rapidly growing a cult fan base due to his virtuosic skills. Ever innovating, he quickly evolved into combining turntables with analog machines and visual storytelling devices to create his signature style. Kid Koala jumps effortlessly between genres as eclectic as hip hop, ambient, alternative, contemporary classical, blues, classic rock and traditional jazz. He has released 5 solo albums on Ninja Tune, and 3 albums on Arts & Crafts Records, the most recent being ''Music To Draw To: IO'' featuring Trixie Whitley. He has also released two award-winning graphic novels: ''Nufonia Must Fall'' and ''Space Cadet''. He has collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, The Slew, Lovage, and The Afiara String Quartet.\n\nKid Koala has toured with the likes of [[Radiohead]], [[the Beastie Boys]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Money Mark]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Mike Patton]], [[DJ Shadow]], and [[The Preservation Hall Jazz Band]]. He has contributed to scores for the films The Great Gatsby, Baby Driver, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Men Women and Children, Shaun of the Dead and Looper amongst others. He has composed music for The National Film Board of Canada, the Cartoon Network, Sesame Street and Adult Swim. He has also been commissioned to create music for runway shows for Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten. \n\nKid Koala\u2019s unforgettable live shows range from touring turntable carnivals like Vinyl Vaudeville, to immersive multimedia shows like Nufonia Must Fall, The Storyville Mosquito, Satellite Turntable Orchestra and his Space Cadet Headphone Concert; each of which express his unique form of storytelling with music, animation, film and interactive entertainment.\n\nKid Koala has toured 6 continents and lives with his wife and two daughters in Montreal, Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan attended [[Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School (Vancouver)|Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, but graduated from [[Thomas Sprigg Wootton High School]], in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], U.S., and went on to study elementary education at [[McGill University]], in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref>Bryant, Luke. \"The new faces of music: Kid Koala's got all the technical moves but more important, he's making new music\" The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia), March 20, 2004, Pg. D3</ref>\n\n==Career==\nSan began by distributing copies of his demo tape ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' to students living in residence at McGill. He is well known for his enigmatic style of [[turntablism]], which uses an unusual collection of samples. He has used samples of music from [[Charlie Brown]] television specials, old comedy sketch routines (including those that mock turntablism), people [[sneezing]], and people reading a menu in [[Cantonese]]. \n\nIn 2000, San released his album, ''Carpal Tunnel Syndrome''. He designed and illustrated the cover for this and his later albums. A comic book he drew is included as the liner notes. Following the release of the album, Kid Koala embarked on an extensive tour, during which he opened for a number of musicians, including [[Radiohead]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=8 |title=Ninja / Ninja Tune |website=Ninjatune.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031006041300/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1317575|title=BBC - collective - kid koala interview - A1317575|date=6 October 2003|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> The [[cabaret]]-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as ''[[The Short Attention Span Theatre]]'', featured an unpredictable opening act\u2014three Djs (Kid Koala, [[P-Love]], and [[DJ Jester the Filipino Fist]]) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on a new book and a multimedia puppet show.\n\nSan released a full length graphic novel, ''[[Nufonia Must Fall]]'', which includes a soundtrack CD he composed. ''Some of my Best Friends are DJs'' includes a [[chess]] set as part of the packaging. In June 2014, the ''[[Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live]]'' made its world premiere at Toronto's Luminato Festival.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412125243/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/nufonia|title=Kid Koala's Nufonia Must Fall Live - Luminato Festival 2014|date=12 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref> Directed by K.K. Barrett, (Oscar-nominee for ''[[Her (film)|Her]])'', this live adaptation of the graphic novel unfolds via a real-time filming of more than a dozen miniature stages, a full crew and cast of puppets. San and the Afiara Quartet provide live scoring on piano, strings and turntables.<ref name=\"luminatofestival1\"/> San also has another project debuting at Luminato Festival entitled ''[[The Lost Train]]'', a collaboration between San and Joe Beef's Chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morin. The two joined together to create a series of \"imaginary journeys with real food and music\", inspired by their respective passion for trains. Taking place at a secret location, the experience will remain a mystery with the guests being taken to an undisclosed location, and will feature a specially created course by Morin and a live set of entirely new material by Kid Koala.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419042641/http://luminatofestival.com/festival/2014/Lost-Train|title=The Lost Train - Luminato Festival 2014|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nSan popularized a method of playing the turntable like a melodic instrument, where a long, single note is dragged under the needle at different speeds, creating different pitches. Since this method of adjusting pitch is imprecise, the resulting notes waver and bend. Thus, in the song \"Drunk Trumpet,\" San uses this method with a trumpet note to simulate a drunken trumpet player, interspersing drunken vocals to complete the effect. When playing live, San often uses records cut with custom sounds from which he creates his own songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artistxite.com/us/magazine/interviews/98385/Interview-with-Kid-Koala-I-consider-myself-one-of-the-worst-DJs-in-the-world.html|title=Interview with Kid Koala : \"I consider myself one of the worst DJs in the world!\"|website=Artistxite.com|accessdate=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\nDuring San Diego [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] 2010, Kid Koala performed before a special free showing of the movie ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]''. The next year at Comic-Con, he performed before a special premiere of the television series ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]''.\n\nIn June 2013, his studio album ''12 bit Blues'' was longlisted for the [[2013 Polaris Music Prize]].\n\nIn early 2017, San released an album, ''Music to Draw To: Satellite'', in collaboration with Icelandic singer [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]].

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species),<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref> and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=PowleslandA>{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D. Donsker, eds. (2020). IOC World Bird List (v 10.1). Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter. Fossils of New Zealand robins can sometimes be found near pit fall deposits, as they do most of their feeding/foraging on the ground.<ref name=Worthy>{{cite book|last1=Worthy|first1=Trevor H.|last2=Holdaway|first2=Richard N.|year=2002|chapter=Shorebirds, Parrots and Passerines|title=The Lost World of the Moa|pages=410\u2013440}}</ref> The fossil record also indicates the robins' presence throughout lowland New Zealand until drastic habitat reduction through deforestation by the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ancestors of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and later European colonisers.<ref name=Borkin>{{cite journal|last=Borkin|first=K.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=PowleslandB>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species),<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref> and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=PowleslandA>{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range of anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left-wing]] views to [[right-wing]] views or [[apolitical]].\n\nPunk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[graffiti]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective houses with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear accessories, clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.\n\nAn attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] (e.g. [[electropop]]) and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] (e.g. [[pop rock]]) in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture\u2014the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who try to associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying core values or philosophy.\n\nBecause [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.\n\nOn religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[skepticism|skeptic]], but some punk bands are [[theism|theist]] and have promoted religions or spirituality such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Taqwacore|Islam]], [[Umbanda]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Neo-Paganism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].\n\n== Specific ideologies and philosophies ==\nThe following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}\n[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]\nThere is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed \"peace punks\" or \"[[anarcho-punk]]s.\" While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' \"[[Anarchy in the UK]]\", they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.<ref>Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}</ref>\n\nAnarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti|legal graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[graffiti|illegal graffiti]], [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Class War]]-style activities, [[melee weapon]]s and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].\n\n=== Animal rights and veganism ===\nIn the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States<ref>{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133\u2013151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}</ref> and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom<ref name=\"descartes\">{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilb\u00fcrger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title=\"Nailing Descartes to the Wall\": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}</ref> became associated with [[animal rights]].

There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].\n\n=== Liberalism ===\n[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 }}</ref> [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]].

Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.\n\n=== Neo-Nazism ===\n{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}\n[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.\n\n=== Nihilism ===\nCentering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their \"confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands.\"<ref>Robbins, Ira, \"Sex Pistols\", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed.

[[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].<ref name=\"Marcus, Greil 1989\" /> [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.'

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxz\u00e9n]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, [[The Jam]]). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: \"... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function\".<ref name=\"marxists.org\"/>\n\n=== Straight edge ===\n{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}\n[[Straight edge]] originated in the [[Washington, D.C.]] hardcore punk scene with the [[Minor Threat]] song \"Straight Edge\" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].\n\n== Criticism of punk ideologies ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nPunk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs \"[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]\" and \"[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]\". [[Crass]]'s song \"White Punks on Hope\" criticizes the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accuses [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier principles. Their song \"Punk is Dead\" attacks corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''\"Punk ain't no religious cult\nPunk means thinking for yourself\nYou ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...\u201d''\n\n[[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become \"[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]\". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.\n\nThe English [[Maoist]] organisation, the [[Progressive Cultural Association]] published a tract called \"Punk Rock Is Fascist\", which says punk rock is part of a reactionary plot to spread fascism by diverting youth's energy away from revolutionary activities.  They also claim punk acts as part of the divide and rule stratagem of American imperialism by creating both a Generation gap and pitting youth against each other. One of its founders, the classical composer, [[Cornelius Cardew]], called [[The Clash]] \"Reactionary\".\n\nIn their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argue that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed.

One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range of anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left-wing]] views to [[right-wing]] views or [[apolitical]].\n\nPunk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[graffiti]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective houses with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear accessories, clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.\n\nAn attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] (e.g. [[electropop]]) and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] (e.g. [[pop rock]]) in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture\u2014the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who try to associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying core values or philosophy.\n\nBecause [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.\n\nOn religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[skepticism|skeptic]], but some punk bands are [[theism|theist]] and have promoted religions or spirituality such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Taqwacore|Islam]], [[Umbanda]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Neo-Paganism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].\n\n== Specific ideologies and philosophies ==\nThe following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}\n[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]\nThere is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed \"peace punks\" or \"[[anarcho-punk]]s.\" While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' \"[[Anarchy in the UK]]\", they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.<ref>Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}</ref>\n\nAnarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti|legal graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[graffiti|illegal graffiti]], [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Class War]]-style activities, [[melee weapon]]s and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].\n\n=== Animal rights and veganism ===\nIn the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States<ref>{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133\u2013151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}</ref> and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom<ref name=\"descartes\">{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilb\u00fcrger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title=\"Nailing Descartes to the Wall\": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}</ref> became associated with [[animal rights]].

Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].\n\n== Criticism of punk ideologies ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nPunk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs \"[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]\" and \"[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]\". [[Crass]]'s song \"White Punks on Hope\" criticizes the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accuses [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier principles. Their song \"Punk is Dead\" attacks corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''\"Punk ain't no religious cult\nPunk means thinking for yourself\nYou ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...\u201d''\n\n[[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become \"[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]\". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.\n\nThe English [[Maoist]] organisation, the [[Progressive Cultural Association]] published a tract called \"Punk Rock Is Fascist\", which says punk rock is part of a reactionary plot to spread fascism by diverting youth's energy away from revolutionary activities.  They also claim punk acts as part of the divide and rule stratagem of American imperialism by creating both a Generation gap and pitting youth against each other. One of its founders, the classical composer, [[Cornelius Cardew]], called [[The Clash]] \"Reactionary\".\n\nIn their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argue that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argue that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anarchism and animal rights]]\n*[[Anarchism and the arts]]\n*[[CrimethInc.]]\n*[[List of political punk songs]]\n*[[Music and politics]]\n*[[Protest art]]\n*[[Rock and roll and the fall of communism]]\n*[[Rock Against Bush]]\n*[[Rock Against Communism]]\n*[[Rock Against Racism]]\n*[[Rock Against Sexism]]\n*[[Youth politics]]\n*[[Youth subcultures]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*O'Hara, Craig, ''The Philosophy of Punk'', AK Press, 1999 {{ISBN|1-873176-16-3}}\n*Garofalo, Rebee, ''Rockin' The Boat: Music and Mass Movements'', [[South End Press]], 1991 {{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}\n*Sinker, Daniel, ''We Owe You Nothing, Punk Planet: The Collected Interviews'', Akashic Books, 2001 {{ISBN|1-888451-14-9}}\n*Taylor, Steven, ''False Prophet: Fieldnotes from the Punk Underground'', Wesleyan University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-8195-6667-5}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Punk]]\n[[Category:Ideologies]]\n[[Category:Australian youth culture]]\n[[Category:Youth culture in the United States]]\n[[Category:Youth culture in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Youth culture]]\n[[Category:Politics]]\n", "name_user": "Quark1005", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eConservatism", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_ideologies"}

Maui County encompasses [[Maui]], [[Lanai|L\u0101na{{okina}}i]], and [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]] in addition to Molokai.

The low western half is very dry and the soil is heavily denuded due to poor land management practices, which allowed over-grazing by goats. It lacks significant ground cover and virtually the entire section is covered in non-native ''kiawe'' (''[[Prosopis pallida]]'') trees. One of the few natural areas remaining almost intact are the coastal [[dune]]s of [[Moomomi|Mo{{okina}}omomi]], which are part of a [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] preserve.\n\nThe eastern half of the island is a high [[plateau]] rising up to an elevation of {{convert|4900|ft|m|abbr=on}} on Kamakou peak and includes the {{convert|2774|acre|km2 sqmi|}} Molokai Forest Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/dofaw/forestry/FRS/reserves/mauinuifr/molokai-forest-reserve|title=Division of Forestry and Wildlife|website=Division of Forestry and Wildlife}}</ref> The eastern half is covered with lush [[Hawaii wet forests|wet forests]] that get more than {{convert|300|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year. The high-elevation forests are populated by native ''{{okina}}\u014dhi{{okina}}a lehua'' (''[[Metrosideros polymorpha]]'') trees and an extremely diverse endemic flora and fauna in the [[understory]]. Much of the summit area is protected by the Nature Conservancy's Kamakou and Pelekunu valley preserves. \n\nBelow {{convert|4000|ft|m|}}, the vegetation is dominated by exotic flora, including [[strawberry guava]] (''Psidium littorale''), eucalyptus (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' spp.), and cypress (''[[Cupressus]]'' spp.). Introduced [[Chital|axis deer]] (''Axis axis'') and [[feral pigs]] (''Sus scrofa'') roam native forests, destroying native plants, expanding exotic plants through disturbance and distribution of their seeds, and threatening endemic [[insect]]s. Near the summit of Kamakou is the unique [[Pepeopae|Pepepae]] [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests#Bogs|bog]], where dwarf ''{{okina}}\u014dhi{{okina}}a'' and other plants cover the soggy ground. \n\nMolokai is home to a great number of [[Endemism|endemic]] plant and animal species. However, many of its species, including the ''[[Oloma\u02bbo|oloma{{okina}}o]]'' (''Myadestes lanaiensis''), ''[[Molokai creeper|k\u0101k\u0101wahie]]'' (''Paroreomyza flammea''), and the [[Moho bishopi|Bishop's \u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d]] (''Moho bishopi'') have become [[Extinction|extinct]]. Molokai is home to a wingless fly among many other endemic insects.\n\n==History==\nIt used to be thought that Molokai was first settled around AD 650 by [[indigenous peoples]] most likely from the [[Marquesas Islands]]. However, a 2010 study using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples has established that the period of eastern Polynesian colonization of the Marquesas Islands took place much later, in a shorter time frame of two waves: the \"earliest in the Society Islands {{circa}} 1025\u20131120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70\u2013265 years, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands {{circa|lk=no}} 1190\u20131290.\"<ref name=\"fast\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/5/1815.full |author1=Janet M.

Because of the islanders' lack of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the new diseases, they suffered high rates of infection and death from [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[whooping cough]], as well as leprosy. Sugar planters were worried about the effects on their labor force and pressured the government to take action to control the spread of leprosy.\n\nThe legislature passed a control act requiring quarantine of people with leprosy. The government established [[Kalawao]] located on the isolated Kalaupapa peninsula on the northern side of Molokai, followed by [[Kalaupapa]] as the sites of a leper colony that operated from 1866 to 1969. Because Kalaupapa had a better climate and sea access, it developed as the main community. A research hospital was developed at Kalawao. The population of these settlements reached a peak of 1100 shortly after the beginning of the 20th century.\n[[File:Molokai coast with a view of the federal leprosarium.jpg|thumb|Leper colony 1907 on Molokai]]\n\nIn total over the decades, more than 8500 men, women and children living throughout the Hawaiian islands and diagnosed with leprosy were exiled to the colony by the Hawaiian government and legally declared dead.

Maui County encompasses [[Maui]], [[Lanai|L\u0101na{{okina}}i]], and [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]] in addition to Molokai.

The low western half is very dry and the soil is heavily denuded due to poor land management practices, which allowed over-grazing by goats. It lacks significant ground cover and virtually the entire section is covered in non-native ''kiawe'' (''[[Prosopis pallida]]'') trees. One of the few natural areas remaining almost intact are the coastal [[dune]]s of [[Moomomi|Mo{{okina}}omomi]], which are part of a [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] preserve.\n\nThe eastern half of the island is a high [[plateau]] rising up to an elevation of {{convert|4900|ft|m|abbr=on}} on Kamakou peak and includes the {{convert|2774|acre|km2 sqmi|}} Molokai Forest Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/dofaw/forestry/FRS/reserves/mauinuifr/molokai-forest-reserve|title=Division of Forestry and Wildlife|website=Division of Forestry and Wildlife}}</ref> The eastern half is covered with lush [[Hawaii wet forests|wet forests]] that get more than {{convert|300|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year. The high-elevation forests are populated by native ''{{okina}}\u014dhi{{okina}}a lehua'' (''[[Metrosideros polymorpha]]'') trees and an extremely diverse endemic flora and fauna in the [[understory]]. Much of the summit area is protected by the Nature Conservancy's Kamakou and Pelekunu valley preserves. \n\nBelow {{convert|4000|ft|m|}}, the vegetation is dominated by exotic flora, including [[strawberry guava]] (''Psidium littorale''), eucalyptus (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' spp.), and cypress (''[[Cupressus]]'' spp.). Introduced [[Chital|axis deer]] (''Axis axis'') and [[feral pigs]] (''Sus scrofa'') roam native forests, destroying native plants, expanding exotic plants through disturbance and distribution of their seeds, and threatening endemic [[insect]]s. Near the summit of Kamakou is the unique [[Pepeopae|Pepepae]] [[Hawaiian tropical rainforests#Bogs|bog]], where dwarf ''{{okina}}\u014dhi{{okina}}a'' and other plants cover the soggy ground. \n\nMolokai is home to a great number of [[Endemism|endemic]] plant and animal species. However, many of its species, including the ''[[Oloma\u02bbo|oloma{{okina}}o]]'' (''Myadestes lanaiensis''), ''[[Molokai creeper|k\u0101k\u0101wahie]]'' (''Paroreomyza flammea''), and the [[Moho bishopi|Bishop's \u2018\u014d\u2018\u014d]] (''Moho bishopi'') have become [[Extinction|extinct]]. Molokai is home to a wingless fly among many other endemic insects.\n\n==History==\nIt used to be thought that Molokai was first settled around AD 650 by [[indigenous peoples]] most likely from the [[Marquesas Islands]]. However, a 2010 study using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples has established that the period of eastern Polynesian colonization of the Marquesas Islands took place much later, in a shorter time frame of two waves: the \"earliest in the Society Islands {{circa}} 1025\u20131120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70\u2013265 years, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands {{circa|lk=no}} 1190\u20131290.\"<ref name=\"fast\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/5/1815.full |author1=Janet M.

Because of the islanders' lack of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the new diseases, they suffered high rates of infection and death from [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[whooping cough]], as well as leprosy. Sugar planters were worried about the effects on their labor force and pressured the government to take action to control the spread of leprosy.\n\nThe legislature passed a control act requiring quarantine of people with leprosy. The government established [[Kalawao]] located on the isolated Kalaupapa peninsula on the northern side of Molokai, followed by [[Kalaupapa]] as the sites of a leper colony that operated from 1866 to 1969. Because Kalaupapa had a better climate and sea access, it developed as the main community. A research hospital was developed at Kalawao. The population of these settlements reached a peak of 1100 shortly after the beginning of the 20th century.\n[[File:Molokai coast with a view of the federal leprosarium.jpg|thumb|Leper colony 1907 on Molokai]]\n\nIn total over the decades, more than 8500 men, women and children living throughout the Hawaiian islands and diagnosed with leprosy were exiled to the colony by the Hawaiian government and legally declared dead. This public health measure was continued after the Kingdom became a U.S. territory. Patients were not allowed to leave the settlement nor have visitors and had to live out their days here. In 1969 the century-old laws of forced quarantine were abolished.
