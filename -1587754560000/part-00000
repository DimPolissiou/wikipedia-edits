In the mid-1920s, he saw the opportunity to produce a very small car for a segment of the market in France that he believed was not being properly covered by any of the major players. He therefore purchased, in 1923, a license to build the English [[Austin 7]] and with support from the engineer [[:fr:Jules Salomon|Jules Salomon]] he purchased the old [[Bellanger (automobile)|Bellanger]] factory in the [[17th arrondissement of Paris]]. The site was a large one and in the early years the business appeared set to fill it.<ref name=Automobilia1953>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ren\u00e9 Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1953 (salon Paris oct 1952)| volume = Nr. 14| pages = Page 67|year = 2000|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris }}</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nAt the plant on the Boulevard de Dixmude, in 1927 production began of the Rosengart LR2 automobile which appeared on the market in 1928, at the same time as the [[Automobilwerk Eisenach|precursor of the first BMW automobile]], also an Austin 7 built under licence, was appearing in [[Germany]]. Numerous variants of the Rosengart LR2 were produced and the car remained in production at least till 1939.\n\nThe LR2 was promoted for its reliability. A production car driven by Fran\u00e7ois Lecot covered {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} per day for more than three and a half months until it had notched up {{convert|100000|km|mi|abbr=on}} without any major mishap, and in the same period an LR2 achieved a class win in 80 of the 81 sporting trials in which it participated.\n\nFrom 1931 the car appeared in modified form as the Rosengart LR4, now heavily differentiated from its Austin origins, and the model's robust character was demonstrated by several long distance trials. Variations on this model would survive until the 1950s, always retaining the original short {{convert|2200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase. A further substantial upgrade of Rosengart's small car took place in 1938 with the appearance of the Rosengart LR42N 4CV.\n\nIn the early 1930s Rosengart teamed up with the German manufacturer [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]], offering license built copies of the Adler Trumpf and Trumpf Junior, small front-drive cars that bolstered its range. It also added a conventional rear-driven car along the lines of a stretched and widened Austin. The development of front-wheel drive models led to the elegant ''Rosengart Supertraction'' model in 1937 - which competed with larger cars like the [[Peugeot 402]] and the [[Berliet|Berliet Dauphine]] for the first time in Rosengart's short history.\n\nUnfortunately the larger cars failed to sell in numbers sufficient to justify the investment involved, and while the small cars achieved relatively satisfactory volumes, the slim margins at the lower end of the market provided a clue as to why the mainstream French auto-makers had tended to avoid it. In 1936 Rosengart himself was in financial difficulties and he transferred the company to a new organisation, Societ\u00e9 Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP).\n\n==War and aftermath==\nProduction of the Supertraction was never large, and the factory was destroyed by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] following the [[Vichy France|German invasion]]. The business was able to survive the German occupation but did not produce cars during the conflict. After the war Lucien Rosengart, who spent the war in exile in the United States, returned to France and tried to guide his company back to the production of the small cars on which its success in the 1920s and 1930s had been based. Unfortunately, the several major manufacturers of France were by then making very small, economical cars that were very well suited to the conditions of post-war France, achieving sales volumes and economies of scale that the Rosengart branded car from SIOP were quite unable to match, leaving the Neuilly plant massively underutilised.\n\n==Postwar==\nThe first small vehicle to arrive after the war was a {{convert|400|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} light van called the Rosengart Vivor which was based on the LR4 model of the 1930s, but available only as a light van or, with side windows on the rear side panels, \u201cbreak\u201d. Production peaked in 1951 with only 873 produced, and in 1953, a year in which just 373 had been manufactured, Vivor production ended.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nIn October 1946 the company exhibited the prototype \u201cRosengart Super 5\u201d at the [[Paris Motor Show]] at the instigation of [[Lucien Rosengart]] himself.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>   However, support for the Super 5 from the Societ\u00e9 Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP) itself (which had held the controlling interest in the business since 1936) was less than whole hearted.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>    Soon after this Rosengart disposed of his residual financial interest in the business that still bore his name, and seems progressively to have withdrawn his involvement.<ref name=Automobilia1948>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ren\u00e9 Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1948 (salon Paris oct 1947)| volume = Nr. 7| pages = Page 70|year = 1998|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris }}</ref>   After the [[Second World War|war]] Rosengart was not one of the automakers selected for inclusion in the post-[[Second World War|war]]  [[Paul-Marie Pons#The Pons Plan|Pons Plan]].<ref name=Automobilia1948/>   The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities identified by politicians and civil servants: exclusion from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials.\n\nLittle more was heard of the \u201cSuper 5\u201d, but late the next year, 1947, the company returned to the [[Paris Motor Show]] with two examples of the new \u201cRosengart SuperTrahuit\u201d.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>  The letters \u201ctra\u201d referred to the fact that the car again featured front wheel drive (traction avant) and \u201chuit\u201d was a reference to its eight (huit) cylinder engine. One of the cars on the exhibition stand was a substantial two door four seater coup\u00e9 and the other was a cabriolet version of what was in other respects the same design. The {{convert|3100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheel base and the {{convert|4950|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheel base could easily have accommodated a four-door sedan, but it seems that none was contemplated.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>   The manufacturer hoped, with this car, to be added to the three auto-makers already incorporated in the all important [[Paul-Marie Pons#The Pons Plan|Pons Plan]] not as an automaker selling into the impoverished domestic market, but as a luxury manufacturer focused on export sales,<ref>(parmi les \u201cvoitures d\u2019exception, destin\u00e9es en priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exportation\u201d)</ref> joining [[Delahaye|Delahaye-Delage]], [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]], and [[Talbot]] in this category. Although recognised for its elegance, the car was not helped in this politically sensitive period by the manufacturer's decision to fit an American [[Ford flathead V8 engine#239|3,917 cc engine]] supplied by Ford's [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury division]].<ref name=Automobilia1948/> There is no record of the manufacturer having persuaded the government to incorporate Rosengart into some revised Pons Plan, and it is not clear how many of the Rosengart Supertrahuit models were actually produced for sale.\n\n==The ''Ariette''==\n[[File:Rosengart - Ariette - 1953 (M.A.R.C.).jpg|thumb|Rosengart Ariette - 1953]]\nThe last Rosengart car, the ''Ariette'', was introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] towards the end of 1951. The small car featured a two-door four seater modern body styled by [[Philippe Charbonneaux]] which received a favourable reception on the show stand, but the body failed to distract attention from the car's \u201canaemic\u201d performance.<ref name=Automobilia1953/> The 747 cc engine had offered adequate power when first used by the [[Austin 7]] in 1922, and the {{convert|21|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} claimed for it in the 1951 Rosengart was a higher output than had been achieved when the company had first used the unit in 1927. A four-speed gear box with synchromesh on the top two ratios and the car's relatively light weight at {{convert|720|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}  would have made the best of the available power, but the engine in the modern looking car was old and outclassed:  the available power was inadequate when set against the asking price which, by 1952, was 668,500 francs.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>   The price may have been justified by the level of the fixed costs to be amortised from the company's large plant in Neuilly, but for a customer able to buy a standard {{convert|21|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Renault 4CV]] for 458,000 francs (or 399,000 francs for the reduced specification Renault 4CV Service) the price of the Rosengart must have been hard to justify.\n\n1952 saw the arrival of an  ''Ariette'' break (station wagon) to replace the unsuccessful Vivor. The break was some {{convert|15|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} heavier than the Ariette saloon at {{convert|735|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and offered an impressive maximum load capacity of {{convert|500|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nMindful of the uncompetitive price of the ''Ariette'', early in 1953 the company (following the example set a few months earlier by the [[Renault 4CV|Renault 4CV Service]]) introduced a stripped-down version called the Artisane. It shared the body shell of the Ariette but without the chrome d\u00e9cor or the wheel trims. The bumpers were coated only in paint and the car was available only in a dark shade of grey. Inside everything that could be removed was, including the back seat.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>   The Artisane was priced at 599,000 francs which was a saving of more than 10% on the price of an Ariette, but by this time the market reception for the Rosengart Artisane was no longer the critical issue.\n\n==The end==\nA few weeks after the end of the 1952 [[Paris Motor Show]] the Societ\u00e9 Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP company) was forced to file for bankruptcy. Financially the founder of the Rosengart auto-business, [[Lucien Rosengart]] was little affected since he had sold the business, including the right to use the Rosengart name, to SIOP in 1936. By now, aged 72, he had retired to the south, and had not been in day to day contact with the business for several years.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nLate in 1952 the gates of the Neuilly plant were closed with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Following negotiation with bankers and other creditors the plant was reopened early in 1953 and production of the Ariette resumed at the rate of approximately four per day, with plans for a rapid increase in those volumes. However, the underlying problem remained that the car could not be sold at a competitive price without selling in large numbers, and it could not sell in large numbers because the price was not competitive.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nThe company closed its doors in the summer of 1955, after failing to launch its new car, the ''Sagaie'', a development of the Ariette with a [[flat-twin engine]].\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Rosengart vehicles}}\n* http://www.ritzsite.nl/Archive/0812.htm\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142434/http://www.ekeren-ton.nl/\n* http://www.rosengart-museum.de/\n* https://www.webcitation.org/6CN8mVEjO?url=http://www.bmwism.com/bmws_designers.htm\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120207170607/http://www.club-rosengart-france.fr/\n* http://www.cartype.com/pages/2588/rosengart_brochures\n\n{{Automotive industry in France}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rosengart}}\n[[Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of France]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of France]]\n[[Category:Luxury motor vehicle manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Paris]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Automobiles L.

Production peaked in 1951 with only 873 produced, and in 1953, a year in which just 373 had been manufactured, Vivor production ended.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nIn October 1946 the company exhibited the prototype \u201cRosengart Super 5\u201d at the [[Paris Motor Show]] at the instigation of [[Lucien Rosengart]] himself.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>   However, support for the Super 5 from the Societ\u00e9 Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP) itself (which had held the controlling interest in the business since 1936) was less than whole hearted.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>    Soon after this Rosengart disposed of his residual financial interest in the business that still bore his name, and seems progressively to have withdrawn his involvement.<ref name=Automobilia1948>{{cite journal| authorlink = Ren\u00e9 Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1948 (salon Paris oct 1947)| volume = Nr. 7| pages = Page 70|year = 1998|isbn = |publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris }}</ref>   After the [[Second World War|war]] Rosengart was not one of the automakers selected for inclusion in the post-[[Second World War|war]]  [[Paul-Marie Pons#The Pons Plan|Pons Plan]].<ref name=Automobilia1948/>   The Pons Plan reflected government determination to structure the French auto-industry according to priorities identified by politicians and civil servants: exclusion from it created great difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions and materials.\n\nLittle more was heard of the \u201cSuper 5\u201d, but late the next year, 1947, the company returned to the [[Paris Motor Show]] with two examples of the new \u201cRosengart SuperTrahuit\u201d.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>  The letters \u201ctra\u201d referred to the fact that the car again featured front wheel drive (traction avant) and \u201chuit\u201d was a reference to its eight (huit) cylinder engine. One of the cars on the exhibition stand was a substantial two door four seater coup\u00e9 and the other was a cabriolet version of what was in other respects the same design. The {{convert|3100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheel base and the {{convert|4950|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheel base could easily have accommodated a four-door sedan, but it seems that none was contemplated.<ref name=Automobilia1948/>   The manufacturer hoped, with this car, to be added to the three auto-makers already incorporated in the all important [[Paul-Marie Pons#The Pons Plan|Pons Plan]] not as an automaker selling into the impoverished domestic market, but as a luxury manufacturer focused on export sales,<ref>(parmi les \u201cvoitures d\u2019exception, destin\u00e9es en priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exportation\u201d)</ref> joining [[Delahaye|Delahaye-Delage]], [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]], and [[Talbot]] in this category. Although recognised for its elegance, the car was not helped in this politically sensitive period by the manufacturer's decision to fit an American [[Ford flathead V8 engine#239|3,917 cc engine]] supplied by Ford's [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury division]].<ref name=Automobilia1948/> There is no record of the manufacturer having persuaded the government to incorporate Rosengart into some revised Pons Plan, and it is not clear how many of the Rosengart Supertrahuit models were actually produced for sale.\n\n==The ''Ariette''==\n[[File:Rosengart - Ariette - 1953 (M.A.R.C.).jpg|thumb|Rosengart Ariette - 1953]]\nThe last Rosengart car, the ''Ariette'', was introduced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] towards the end of 1951. The small car featured a two-door four seater modern body styled by [[Philippe Charbonneaux]] which received a favourable reception on the show stand, but the body failed to distract attention from the car's \u201canaemic\u201d performance.<ref name=Automobilia1953/> The 747 cc engine had offered adequate power when first used by the [[Austin 7]] in 1922, and the {{convert|21|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} claimed for it in the 1951 Rosengart was a higher output than had been achieved when the company had first used the unit in 1927. A four-speed gear box with synchromesh on the top two ratios and the car's relatively light weight at {{convert|720|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}  would have made the best of the available power, but the engine in the modern looking car was old and outclassed:  the available power was inadequate when set against the asking price which, by 1952, was 668,500 francs.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>   The price may have been justified by the level of the fixed costs to be amortised from the company's large plant in Neuilly, but for a customer able to buy a standard {{convert|21|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Renault 4CV]] for 458,000 francs (or 399,000 francs for the reduced specification Renault 4CV Service) the price of the Rosengart must have been hard to justify.\n\n1952 saw the arrival of an  ''Ariette'' break (station wagon) to replace the unsuccessful Vivor. The break was some {{convert|15|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} heavier than the Ariette saloon at {{convert|735|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and offered an impressive maximum load capacity of {{convert|500|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nMindful of the uncompetitive price of the ''Ariette'', early in 1953 the company (following the example set a few months earlier by the [[Renault 4CV|Renault 4CV Service]]) introduced a stripped-down version called the Artisane. It shared the body shell of the Ariette but without the chrome d\u00e9cor or the wheel trims. The bumpers were coated only in paint and the car was available only in a dark shade of grey. Inside everything that could be removed was, including the back seat.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>   The Artisane was priced at 599,000 francs which was a saving of more than 10% on the price of an Ariette, but by this time the market reception for the Rosengart Artisane was no longer the critical issue.\n\n==The end==\nA few weeks after the end of the 1952 [[Paris Motor Show]] the Societ\u00e9 Industrielle de l'Ouest Parisien (SIOP company) was forced to file for bankruptcy. Financially the founder of the Rosengart auto-business, [[Lucien Rosengart]] was little affected since he had sold the business, including the right to use the Rosengart name, to SIOP in 1936. By now, aged 72, he had retired to the south, and had not been in day to day contact with the business for several years.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nLate in 1952 the gates of the Neuilly plant were closed with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Following negotiation with bankers and other creditors the plant was reopened early in 1953 and production of the Ariette resumed at the rate of approximately four per day, with plans for a rapid increase in those volumes. However, the underlying problem remained that the car could not be sold at a competitive price without selling in large numbers, and it could not sell in large numbers because the price was not competitive.<ref name=Automobilia1953/>\n\nThe company closed its doors in the summer of 1955, after failing to launch its new car, the ''Sagaie'', a development of the Ariette with a [[flat-twin engine]].\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Rosengart vehicles}}\n* http://www.ritzsite.nl/Archive/0812.htm\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20110726142434/http://www.ekeren-ton.nl/\n* http://www.rosengart-museum.de/\n* https://www.webcitation.org/6CN8mVEjO?url=http://www.bmwism.com/bmws_designers.htm\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120207170607/http://www.club-rosengart-france.fr/\n* http://www.cartype.com/pages/2588/rosengart_brochures\n\n{{Automotive industry in France}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rosengart}}\n[[Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of France]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of France]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Paris]]\n", "name_user": "24.108.70.155", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobiles_L._Rosengart"}

The dynasty originated among the [[Lamtuna]] and the [[Godala|Gudala]], nomadic Berber tribes of the [[Sahara]], traversing the territory between the [[Draa River|Draa]], the [[Niger River|Niger]], and the [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers.<ref>Extract from [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/A912241/ALMORAVIDES.htm ''Encyclopedia Universalis on Almoravids''].</ref>\n\nThe Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of [[Al-Andalus]] to the [[Iberia]]n Christian kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] armies at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers (1,900&nbsp;mi) north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell\u2014at the height of their power\u2014when they failed to stop the [[Masmuda]]-led rebellion initiated by [[Ibn Tumart]]. As a result, their last king [[Ishaq ibn Ali]] was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the [[Almohad Caliphate]], who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and [[Al-Andalus]].\n==Name==\nThe term \"Almoravid\" comes from the [[Arabic]] \"al-Murabit\" ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}}), through the {{lang-es|almor\u00e1vide}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/almoravid|title=Almoravid {{!}} Definition of Almoravid by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> The transformation of the ''b'' in \"al-Murabit\" to the ''v'' in ''almor\u00e1vide'' is an example of [[betacism]] in Spanish.\n\nIn Arabic, \"al-Murabit\" literally means \"one who is tying\" but figuratively means \"one who is ready for battle at a fortress\". The term is related to the notion of ''[[ribat]]'' {{Lang|ar|\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0627\u0637}}, a North African frontier monastery-fortress, through the [[Semitic root|root]] [[wiktionary:\u0631_\u0628_\u0637|r-b-t]] ({{lang|ar|\u0631\u0628\u0637}} \"rabat\": ''to tie , to unite'' or {{lang|ar|\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}} \"raabat\": ''to encamp'').<ref>[[Nehemia Levtzion]], \"Abd Allah b.

Ibn Zallu sent his student [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] to preach Malikite Islam to the Sanhaja Berbers of the Sous and [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] (present-day [[Mauritania]]). Hence, the name of the Almoravids comes from the followers of the Dar al-Murabitin, \"the house of those who were bound together in the cause of God.\"<ref>Messier, Ronald A. ''The Almoravids and the meanings of jihad'', Santa Barbara, CA. Praeger Publishers, 2010.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. [[al-Bakri]], writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the ''al-Murabitun'', but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, [[Ibn Abi Zar]] suggested it was chosen early on by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]<ref>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 81]].</ref> because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ''ribat'' (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly [[Tidra]] island, in the [[Bay of Arguin]]).<ref>Ibn Abi Zar's account is translated in N. Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds (2000), ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'', University of Ghana,pp. 239ff. For tentative identification of the ''ribat'', see Moraes Farias (1967).</ref> [[Ibn Idhari]] wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the \"persevering in the fight\" sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the [[Draa]] valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications.\n\nThe name might be related to the ''ribat'' of [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag ibn Zallu]] in the village of [[Tnine Aglou|Aglu]] (near present-day [[Tiznit]]), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer [[Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili]], and [[Qadi Ayyad]] before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called ''Dar al-Murabitin'' (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ibn al-Zayyat|title=\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0641|year=1220|page=89|authorlink=Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili|trans-title=Looking to know the men of Sufism}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Qadi Ayyad|title=\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643.|orig-year=12th century|pages=839\u201340|authorlink=Qadi Ayyad|trans-title=Biographies of Eminent Maliki Scholars}}</ref>\n\nContemporaries frequently referred to them as the ''al-mulathimun'' (\"the veiled ones\", from ''[[litham]]'', [[Arabic]] for \"veil\"). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a [[tagelmust]], a custom they adapted from southern [[Sanhaja]] Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern [[Tuareg people]], but it was unusual further north.) Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of \"foreignness\" in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids. Under their rule, [[sumptuary law]]s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding [[Almohads]] made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of [[effeminacy]] and decadence.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Berbers of the [[Tamazgha]] in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the [[Zenata]] across the north, the [[Masmuda]] concentrated in central Morocco, and the Sanhaja, clustered in two areas: the western part of the [[Sahara]] and the hills of the eastern Maghreb.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u02bbAbd al-W\u0101\u1e25id Dhann\u016bn \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}})</ref><ref>Mones (1988), p. 119; (1992), p. 228.</ref> The eastern Sanhaja included the [[Kutama]] Berbers, who had been the base of the [[Fatimid]] rise in the early 10th century, and the [[Zirid dynasty]], who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western [[Sanhaja]] were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the [[Lamta]] in the [[Draa valley]] and the foothills of the [[Anti-Atlas]] range; further south, encamped in the western [[Sahara desert]], were the Massufa, the [[Lamtuna]] and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala, in littoral [[Mauritania]] down to the borderlands of the [[Senegal River]].\n\nThe western Sanhaja had been converted to [[Islam]] some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched several campaigns against the \"[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese\" (pagan peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]).<ref>Lewicki (1988), pp. 160\u201361; (1992), pp. 308\u201309.</ref> Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of [[Awdaghust]], a critical stop on the [[trans-Saharan trade]] route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the [[Ghana empire]]; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the Zenata [[Maghrawa]] of [[Sijilmassa]]. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years.\n\nAround 1040, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. On his return, he stopped by [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]], where he met [[Abu Imran al-Fasi]], a native of [[Fes]] and a jurist and scholar of the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] ruler [[al-Muizz ibn Badis]], was openly contemplating breaking with his [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]] overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Within this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of [[Scharia|Islamic law]] among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the ''ribat'' of Waggag ibn Zelu in the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]].\n\nAbdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as \"son of [[Ya Sin]]\" (the title of the 36th [[Sura]] of the [[Qur'an]]), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was \"re-born\" of the Holy Book.<ref>M. Brett and E. Fentress (1996), ''The Berbers'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 100. Revealingly, the 36th Sura begins the salutation \"You are one of messengers\" and the imperative duty to set people \"on the straight path\". Ibn Yasin's choice of name was probably not a coincidence.</ref> Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]].<ref name=\"shilling88\" /> (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s.\n\nIbn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people.<ref name=\"shilling88\">{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-333-59957-0|page=88}}</ref> Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni]] invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as \"opposition\". He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin\u2014soon calling themselves the ''al-Murabitin'' (Almoravids)\u2014set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause.\n\n==Conquests==\n{{Campaignbox Almoravid Empire battles}}\n\n===Northern Africa===\nFrom the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the [[Sanhaja]] Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing [[Sijilmasa]] at the northern end in 1054, and [[Aoudaghost]] at the southern end in 1055. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in a battle in 1057,<ref name=\"shilling90\">Shillington, p. 90.</ref> but Abdullah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a Berber tribal confederation, who followed an Islamic \"heresy\" preached by [[Salih ibn Tarif]] three centuries earlier. The Berghouata resisted. Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in battle with them in 1059, in Krifla, a village near [[Rommani]], [[Morocco]]. They were, however, completely conquered by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, and were forced to convert to orthodox Islam.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Abu Bakr married a noble and wealthy Berber woman, [[Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat]], who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty.<ref name=ZAR87>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 87]].</ref> Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara, who was said to be from [[Kairouan]].<ref name=ZAR87/>\n[[File:Camel Rider 1413 Mecia Viladestes map.jpg|thumb|A 1493 depiction of the 11th century Almoravid general [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] (\"Rex Bubecar\") near the [[Senegal River]].

Ibn Umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert.

''Muslim Societies in African History'' (New approaches to African History)</ref> An example of this tradition is the record of historian [[Ibn Khaldun]], who cited Shaykh Uthman, the [[Faq\u012bh|faqih]] of Ghana, writing in 1394. According to this source, the Almoravids weakened Ghana and collected tribute from the Sudan, to the extent that the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were subjugated and absorbed by the [[Sosso Empire|Susu]], a neighboring people of the Sudan.<ref>Ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl.

Lange attributes the decline of ancient Ghana to numerous unrelated factors, only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by Almoravid influence and Islamic pressures, but devoid of military conversion and conquest.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lange|first= Dierk|date=1996|title=The Almoravid expansion and the downfall of Ghana|journal= Der Islam|number= 73 |pp= 122\u2013159|ref=harv}}.</ref>\n\nThis interpretation of events has been disputed by later scholars like Sheryl L. Burkhalter (1992), who argued that, whatever the nature of the \"conquest\" in the south of the Sahara, the influence and success of the Almoravid movement in securing west African gold and circulating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control,.<ref>G\u00f3mez-Rivas, Camilo. ''Law and the Islamization of Morocco under the Almoravids'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nThe traditional position says that the ensuing war with the Almoravids pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100. It collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the [[Mali Empire]].\n\nThe Arab geographer [[Al-Zuhri]] wrote that the Almoravids ended [[Ibadi]]sm in Tadmekka in 1084 and that Abu Bakr \"arrived at the mountain of gold\" in the deep south.\nAfter the death of Abu Bakr (1087), the confederation of Berber tribes in the Sahara was divided between the descendants of Abu Bakr and his brother Yahya, and would have lost control of Ghana.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3: From c.1050 to c.1600''</ref> Sheryl Burkhalter suggests that Abu Bakr's son Yahya was the leader of the Almoravid expedition that conquered Ghana in 1076, and that the Almoravids would have survived the loss of Ghana and the defeat in the Maghreb by the Almohads, and would have ruled the Sahara until the end of the 12th century.<ref>Burkhalter, Sheryl L.

In that year, Ibn Tashfin crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to [[Algeciras]], and defeated Castile at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah]] (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he chose to settle in person.\n\nHe returned to Iberia in 1090, avowedly for the purpose of annexing the ''taifa'' principalities of Iberia. He was supported by most of the Iberian people, who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from [[Tortosa]]), detested the ''taifa'' rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major ''taifas'', with the exception of the one at [[Saragossa]]. The Almoravids were victorious at the [[Battle of Consuegra]], during which the son of [[El Cid]], Diego Rodr\u00edguez, perished. Alfonso, with some Le\u00f3nese, retreated into the castle of Consuegra, which was besieged for eight days until the Almoravids withdrew to the south.\n\nAfter friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' (\"Commander of the Faithful\"), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' (\"Commander of the Muslims\"). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100. The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death: the Moorish empire then included all of Northwest Africa as far eastward as [[Algiers]], and all of Iberia south of the [[Tagus]] and as far eastward as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], and including the [[Balearic Islands]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=717\u2013718}}\n\nIn 1108 Tamim Al Yusuf defeated the [[Kingdom of Castile]] at the [[Battle of Ucl\u00e9s (1108)|Battle of Ucl\u00e9s]].

The dynasty originated among the [[Lamtuna]] and the [[Godala|Gudala]], nomadic Berber tribes of the [[Sahara]], traversing the territory between the [[Draa River|Draa]], the [[Niger River|Niger]], and the [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers.<ref>Extract from [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/A912241/ALMORAVIDES.htm ''Encyclopedia Universalis on Almoravids''].</ref>\n\nThe Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of [[Al-Andalus]] to the [[Iberia]]n Christian kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] armies at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers (1,900&nbsp;mi) north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell\u2014at the height of their power\u2014when they failed to stop the [[Masmuda]]-led rebellion initiated by [[Ibn Tumart]]. As a result, their last king [[Ishaq ibn Ali]] was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the [[Almohad Caliphate]], who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and [[Al-Andalus]].\n==Name==\nThe term \"Almoravid\" comes from the [[Arabic]] \"al-Murabit\" ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}}), through the {{lang-es|almor\u00e1vide}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/almoravid|title=Almoravid {{!}} Definition of Almoravid by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> The transformation of the ''b'' in \"al-Murabit\" to the ''v'' in ''almor\u00e1vide'' is an example of [[betacism]] in Spanish.\n\nIn Arabic, \"al-Murabit\" literally means \"one who is tying\" but figuratively means \"one who is ready for battle at a fortress\". The term is related to the notion of ''[[ribat]]'' {{Lang|ar|\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0627\u0637}}, a North African frontier monastery-fortress, through the [[Semitic root|root]] [[wiktionary:\u0631_\u0628_\u0637|r-b-t]] ({{lang|ar|\u0631\u0628\u0637}} \"rabat\": ''to tie , to unite'' or {{lang|ar|\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}} \"raabat\": ''to encamp'').<ref>[[Nehemia Levtzion]], \"Abd Allah b.

Ibn Zallu sent his student [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] to preach Malikite Islam to the Sanhaja Berbers of the Sous and [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] (present-day [[Mauritania]]). Hence, the name of the Almoravids comes from the followers of the Dar al-Murabitin, \"the house of those who were bound together in the cause of God.\"<ref>Messier, Ronald A. ''The Almoravids and the meanings of jihad'', Santa Barbara, CA. Praeger Publishers, 2010.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. [[al-Bakri]], writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the ''al-Murabitun'', but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, [[Ibn Abi Zar]] suggested it was chosen early on by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]<ref>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 81]].</ref> because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ''ribat'' (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly [[Tidra]] island, in the [[Bay of Arguin]]).<ref>Ibn Abi Zar's account is translated in N. Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds (2000), ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'', University of Ghana,pp. 239ff. For tentative identification of the ''ribat'', see Moraes Farias (1967).</ref> [[Ibn Idhari]] wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the \"persevering in the fight\" sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the [[Draa]] valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications.\n\nThe name might be related to the ''ribat'' of [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag ibn Zallu]] in the village of [[Tnine Aglou|Aglu]] (near present-day [[Tiznit]]), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer [[Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili]], and [[Qadi Ayyad]] before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called ''Dar al-Murabitin'' (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ibn al-Zayyat|title=\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0641|year=1220|page=89|authorlink=Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili|trans-title=Looking to know the men of Sufism}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Qadi Ayyad|title=\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643.|orig-year=12th century|pages=839\u201340|authorlink=Qadi Ayyad|trans-title=Biographies of Eminent Maliki Scholars}}</ref>\n\nContemporaries frequently referred to them as the ''al-mulathimun'' (\"the veiled ones\", from ''[[litham]]'', [[Arabic]] for \"veil\"). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a [[tagelmust]], a custom they adapted from southern [[Sanhaja]] Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern [[Tuareg people]], but it was unusual further north.) Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of \"foreignness\" in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids. Under their rule, [[sumptuary law]]s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding [[Almohads]] made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of [[effeminacy]] and decadence.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Berbers of the [[Tamazgha]] in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the [[Zenata]] across the north, the [[Masmuda]] concentrated in central Morocco, and the Sanhaja, clustered in two areas: the western part of the [[Sahara]] and the hills of the eastern Maghreb.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u02bbAbd al-W\u0101\u1e25id Dhann\u016bn \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}})</ref><ref>Mones (1988), p. 119; (1992), p. 228.</ref> The eastern Sanhaja included the [[Kutama]] Berbers, who had been the base of the [[Fatimid]] rise in the early 10th century, and the [[Zirid dynasty]], who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western [[Sanhaja]] were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the [[Lamta]] in the [[Draa valley]] and the foothills of the [[Anti-Atlas]] range; further south, encamped in the western [[Sahara desert]], were the Massufa, the [[Lamtuna]] and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala, in littoral [[Mauritania]] down to the borderlands of the [[Senegal River]].\n\nThe western Sanhaja had been converted to [[Islam]] some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched several campaigns against the \"[[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese\" (pagan peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]).<ref>Lewicki (1988), pp. 160\u201361; (1992), pp. 308\u201309.</ref> Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of [[Awdaghust]], a critical stop on the [[trans-Saharan trade]] route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the [[Ghana empire]]; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the Zenata [[Maghrawa]] of [[Sijilmassa]]. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years.\n\nAround 1040, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. On his return, he stopped by [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]], where he met [[Abu Imran al-Fasi]], a native of [[Fes]] and a jurist and scholar of the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] ruler [[al-Muizz ibn Badis]], was openly contemplating breaking with his [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]] overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Within this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of [[Scharia|Islamic law]] among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the ''ribat'' of Waggag ibn Zelu in the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]].\n\nAbdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as \"son of [[Ya Sin]]\" (the title of the 36th [[Sura]] of the [[Qur'an]]), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was \"re-born\" of the Holy Book.<ref>M. Brett and E. Fentress (1996), ''The Berbers'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 100. Revealingly, the 36th Sura begins the salutation \"You are one of messengers\" and the imperative duty to set people \"on the straight path\". Ibn Yasin's choice of name was probably not a coincidence.</ref> Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]].<ref name=\"shilling88\" /> (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s.\n\nIbn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people.<ref name=\"shilling88\">{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-333-59957-0|page=88}}</ref> Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni]] invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as \"opposition\". He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin\u2014soon calling themselves the ''al-Murabitin'' (Almoravids)\u2014set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause.\n\n==Conquests==\n{{Campaignbox Almoravid Empire battles}}\n\n===Northern Africa===\nFrom the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the [[Sanhaja]] Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing [[Sijilmasa]] at the northern end in 1054, and [[Aoudaghost]] at the southern end in 1055. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in a battle in 1057,<ref name=\"shilling90\">Shillington, p. 90.</ref> but Abdullah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a Berber tribal confederation, who followed an Islamic \"heresy\" preached by [[Salih ibn Tarif]] three centuries earlier. The Berghouata resisted. Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in battle with them in 1059, in Krifla, a village near [[Rommani]], [[Morocco]]. They were, however, completely conquered by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, and were forced to convert to orthodox Islam.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Abu Bakr married a noble and wealthy Berber woman, [[Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat]], who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty.<ref name=ZAR87>[[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 87]].</ref> Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara, who was said to be from [[Kairouan]].<ref name=ZAR87/>\n[[File:Camel Rider 1413 Mecia Viladestes map.jpg|thumb|A 1493 depiction of the 11th century Almoravid general [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] (\"Rex Bubecar\") near the [[Senegal River]].

According to this source, the Almoravids weakened Ghana and collected tribute from the Sudan, to the extent that the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were subjugated and absorbed by the [[Sosso Empire|Susu]], a neighboring people of the Sudan.<ref>Ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl.

''Law and the Islamization of Morocco under the Almoravids'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nThe traditional position says that the ensuing war with the Almoravids pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100. It collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the [[Mali Empire]].\n\nThe Arab geographer [[Al-Zuhri]] wrote that the Almoravids ended [[Ibadi]]sm in Tadmekka in 1084 and that Abu Bakr \"arrived at the mountain of gold\" in the deep south.\nAfter the death of Abu Bakr (1087), the confederation of Berber tribes in the Sahara was divided between the descendants of Abu Bakr and his brother Yahya, and would have lost control of Ghana.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3: From c.1050 to c.1600''</ref> Sheryl Burkhalter suggests that Abu Bakr's son Yahya was the leader of the Almoravid expedition that conquered Ghana in 1076, and that the Almoravids would have survived the loss of Ghana and the defeat in the Maghreb by the Almohads, and would have ruled the Sahara until the end of the 12th century.<ref>Burkhalter, Sheryl L.

In that year, Ibn Tashfin crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to [[Algeciras]], and defeated Castile at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah]] (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he chose to settle in person.\n\nHe returned to Iberia in 1090, avowedly for the purpose of annexing the ''taifa'' principalities of Iberia. He was supported by most of the Iberian people, who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from [[Tortosa]]), detested the ''taifa'' rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major ''taifas'', with the exception of the one at [[Saragossa]]. The Almoravids were victorious at the [[Battle of Consuegra]], during which the son of [[El Cid]], Diego Rodr\u00edguez, perished. Alfonso, with some Le\u00f3nese, retreated into the castle of Consuegra, which was besieged for eight days until the Almoravids withdrew to the south.\n\nAfter friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' (\"Commander of the Faithful\"), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' (\"Commander of the Muslims\"). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100. The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death: the Moorish empire then included all of Northwest Africa as far eastward as [[Algiers]], and all of Iberia south of the [[Tagus]] and as far eastward as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], and including the [[Balearic Islands]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=717\u2013718}}\n\nIn 1108 Tamim Al Yusuf defeated the [[Kingdom of Castile]] at the [[Battle of Ucl\u00e9s (1108)|Battle of Ucl\u00e9s]].
