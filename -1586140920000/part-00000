They settled in [[Los Angeles]], where Carnera opened a restaurant and a liquor store. They had two children, Umberto and Giovanna Maria.

Carnera won by [[knockout]] in round two.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=11-12}} He won his first six bouts, then lost to Franz Diener by disqualification in round one at [[Leipzig]]. Then, he won seven more bouts in a row before meeting [[Young Stribling]]. He and Stribling exchanged disqualification wins, Carnera winning the first in four rounds, and Stribling winning the rematch in round seven. In Carnera's next bout he avenged his defeat to Diener with a knockout in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=22}}\n\nIn 1930, he moved to the United States, where he toured extensively, winning his first seventeen bouts there by knockout. [[George Godfrey (boxer born 1897)|George Godfrey]] broke the knockout streak in [[Philadelphia]] by losing to Carnera by disqualification in the fifth round.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=52}} In 1932, Carnera faced the tallest heavyweight in history up to that point, [[Santa Camar\u00e3o]], a {{height|ft=6|in=8}} [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fighter. Carnera won the fight in a sixth-round knockout.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=93-94}}\n\nOn 10 February 1933, he knocked out [[Ernie Schaaf]] in thirteen rounds in New York City. Schaaf died four days later.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=100}} Schaaf had suffered a severe beating and knockout in a bout with future heavyweight champion [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] six months earlier, on 31 August 1932.

Carnera became world champion by knocking out Sharkey in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=117}}\n\nHe retained the title against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] and [[Tommy Loughran]], both by decision in 15 rounds, but in his next fight on 14 June 1934 against [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], Carnera was knocked down multiple times in 11 rounds, before referee Arthur Donovon stopped the fight. There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per [[Associated Press]]) and 12 (per [[The Ring Magazine|''The Ring'' magazine]] founder [[Nat Fleischer]], ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Primo_Carnera_vs._Max_Baer |title=Primo Carnera vs. Max Baer\u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by [[Joe Louis]].\n\nFor the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. But in 1938, Carnera, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} Carnera's record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.\n\nCarnera died in 1967 in his native town of a combination of [[liver]] disease and complications from diabetes.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=7, 214}}\n\n====Legacy in boxing====\nCarnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[Max Schmeling]]. He would be the last until [[Ingemar Johansson]] claimed the title against [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Tommy Loughran]] held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight ({{convert|86|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or}})<ref>{{cite news |title=TOMMY LOUGHRAN DIES AT 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/obituaries/tommy-loughran-dies-at-79.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 1982 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> for 73 years until the reign of [[Nikolai Valuev]], who owns the current record for the {{convert|105+1/2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against [[Monte Barrett]].\n\nValuev also broke Carnera's record of {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as {{convert|328|lb|kg|abbr=on}} during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the second-heaviest, over eighty years after he held the title.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s title defence against [[Frank Moran]] in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until [[Muhammad Ali]] defended the title against [[Henry Cooper]] in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It was not until [[Lennox Lewis]] defended the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman [[Frank Bruno]] in 1993, sixty years later, that this would occur again.\n\nTrailing only [[Ezzard Charles]] and his 95 wins, Carnera holds the second-most victories of all heavyweight champions with 88.

During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' starring Max Baer and [[Myrna Loy]]. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just the year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}}\n\nCarnera had a silent bit part in the 1949 movie [[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|''Mighty Joe Young'']].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}} He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera throws a couple of futile punches to Joe's chin.\n\nHe also played a bully boy wrestler in [[Carol Reed]]'s film [[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|''A Kid for Two Farthings'']] (1955) based around London's [[Petticoat Lane Market]] where he has a match against a local bodybuilder who is marrying [[Diana Dors]].\n\nPrimo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943,<ref name=\"IMDM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138712/|title=Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> as well as several in the 1950s, like [[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047365/|title=Prince Valiant|date=5 April 1954|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> in the role of Sligon.

But the next year, after three losses against [[Luigi Musina]] his talent for [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] was discovered. In 1946 he became a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and was immediately a huge success at the box office. For several years he was one of the top draws in wrestling. Carnera continued to be an attraction into the 1960s. Max Baer attended at least one of Carnera's wrestling matches.<ref>[http://www.mmbolding.com/Heavyweights/Boxer_vs._Wrestler_Primo_Carnera.htm The Strange Case of Carnera, By Jack Sher, ''Sport'', February 1948]</ref> Carnera won his debut on 22 August 1946, when he defeated Tommy O'Toole in California. On 23 October 1946, Carnera won his 41st consecutive wrestling match by defeating Jules Strongbow.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=187}} On 19 November 1946, Carnera beat Harry Kruskamp to remain undefeated at 65-0-0.\n\nPrimo Carnera went 120 straight wrestling matches undefeated (119-0-1) before suffering his first loss to Yvon Robert in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, on 20 August 1947. Carnera's greatest victory took place on 7 December 1947 when he defeated former world heavyweight champion [[Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis]].\n\nIn May 1948, Carnera took a 143-1-1 record against world heavyweight champion [[Lou Thesz]].

It was adapted into [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]]'s 1956 film, which starred [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Rod Steiger]]. A highlight was the appearance of [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], playing a fighter the mob could not fix who destroys the giant in his first fair fight. Critics drew parallels with the real-life Baer-Carnera fight two decades before. In response, Carnera unsuccessfully sued the film's company.\n\nCarnera played himself in the 1949 movie ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''.\n\nCarnera was played by Matthew G.

Both Carnera and German boxer [[Max Schmeling]] are referenced for their bouts with American [[Joe Louis]].\n\n===In mathematics===\nThe definition of the number [[googolplex]] was originally suggested by a child to be \"one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired.\" The mathematician involved, [[Edward Kasner]], decided to adopt the more formal definition of 10<sup>(10<sup>100</sup>)</sup> because \"different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera a better mathematician than [[Albert Einstein|Dr. Einstein]], simply because he had more endurance and could write for longer.\"<ref>Edward Kasner & James R. Newman (1940) ''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]'', page 23, New York: Simon & Schuster</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{Boxing record start}}\n|- align=center\n|{{no2}}Loss || 89\u201314

October 1906 \u2013 29 June 1967),  nicknamed the '''Ambling Alp''', was an Italian professional [[Boxing|boxer]] and [[Professional Wrestling|wrestler]] who reigned as the boxing World Heavyweight Champion from 29 June 1933 to 14 June 1934.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Personal life===\nPrimo Carnera was born in [[Sequals]], then in the [[Province of Udine]], now in the [[Province of Pordenone]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] at the north-easternmost corner of Italy.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=5}}\n\nOn 13 March 1939, Carnera married Giuseppina Kova\u010di\u010d (1913\u20131980), a post office clerk from [[Gorizia]].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} In 1953 they became American citizens. They settled in [[Los Angeles]], where Carnera opened a restaurant and a liquor store. They had two children, Umberto and Giovanna Maria. Umberto became a medical doctor.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=212}}\n\n===Professional boxing career===\n====Overview====\nCarnera was touted in America as being {{height|ft=6|in=7}} tall, and thus the tallest heavyweight in history (up until that time), but he was actually {{height|ft=6|in=6}} tall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:12086 |title=Primo Carnera \u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> He fought at as much as {{convert|275|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/carnera.htm|title=Cyber Boxing Zone -- Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> [[Jess Willard]] who stood {{height|ft=6|in=7}} was the tallest world heavyweight champion in boxing history until [[Nikolai Valuev]], at {{height|ft=7|in=0}} and {{convert|328|lb|kg}}. Though {{convert|1|in|cm|spell=in}} shorter than Willard, Carnera was around {{convert|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}} heavier and was the heaviest champion in boxing history until Valuev.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nAt a time when the average height in Italy was approximately {{height|ft=5|in=5}} and in the United States {{height|ft=5|in=7}},<ref>{{cite web|last=Steckel|first=Richard H.|title=A History of the Standard of Living in the United States|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/a-history-of-the-standard-of-living-in-the-united-states/ |accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Carnera was considered a giant.\n\nHe enjoyed a sizable reach advantage over most rivals, and when seen on fight footage, he seems like a towering giant compared to many heavyweights of his era, who were usually at least {{convert|60|lb|kg}} lighter and {{convert|7|in|cm}} shorter. One publicity release about him read in part: \"For breakfast, Primo has a quart of orange juice, two quarts of milk, nineteen pieces of toast, fourteen eggs, a loaf of bread and half a pound of Virginia ham.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LzhBcWcf8QC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6 |title=Cinderella Man: James J.

Carnera won by [[knockout]] in round two.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=11-12}} He won his first six bouts, then lost to Franz Diener by disqualification in round one at [[Leipzig]]. Then, he won seven more bouts in a row before meeting [[Young Stribling]]. He and Stribling exchanged disqualification wins, Carnera winning the first in four rounds, and Stribling winning the rematch in round seven. In Carnera's next bout he avenged his defeat to Diener with a knockout in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=22}}\n\nIn 1930, he moved to the United States, where he toured extensively, winning his first seventeen bouts there by knockout. [[George Godfrey (boxer born 1897)|George Godfrey]] broke the knockout streak in [[Philadelphia]] by losing to Carnera by disqualification in the fifth round.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=52}} In 1932, Carnera faced the tallest heavyweight in history up to that point, [[Santa Camar\u00e3o]], a {{height|ft=6|in=8}} [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fighter. Carnera won the fight in a sixth-round knockout.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=93-94}}\n\nOn 10 February 1933, he knocked out [[Ernie Schaaf]] in thirteen rounds in New York City. Schaaf died four days later.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=100}} Schaaf had suffered a severe beating and knockout in a bout with future heavyweight champion [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] six months earlier, on 31 August 1932. Furthermore, an autopsy revealed that Schaaf had [[meningitis]], a swelling of the brain, and was still recovering from a severe case of [[influenza]] when he entered the ring with Carnera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maxbaer.org/faqs.html |title=FAQs |first=Catherine |last=Johnson |website=www.maxbaer.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092641/http://www.maxbaer.org/faqs.html |date=2007 |archivedate=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2018-11-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ibroresearch.com/Articles/Max%20Baer%20and%20Death%20of%20Ernie%20Schaaf.htm |title=Max Baer and the Death of Ernie Schaaf |first=Michael |last=Hunnicutt |work=International Boxing Research Organization |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419025505/http://www.ibroresearch.com/Articles/Max%20Baer%20and%20Death%20of%20Ernie%20Schaaf.htm |date=2005-04-05 |archivedate=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2018-11-26 }}</ref>\n\nFor his next fight, Carnera faced the world heavyweight champion, [[Jack Sharkey]], on June 29, at the [[Madison Square Garden Bowl]] in [[Queens, New York]]. Carnera became world champion by knocking out Sharkey in round six.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=117}}\n\nHe retained the title against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] and [[Tommy Loughran]], both by decision in 15 rounds, but in his next fight on 14 June 1934 against [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], Carnera was knocked down multiple times in 11 rounds, before referee Arthur Donovon stopped the fight. There is disagreement regarding how many times Carnera was knocked down, with sources giving conflicting totals of 7, 10, 11 (per [[Associated Press]]) and 12 (per [[The Ring Magazine|''The Ring'' magazine]] founder [[Nat Fleischer]], ringside for the fight, who wrote that Carnera was knocked down 12 times and slipped once after a missed punch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Primo_Carnera_vs._Max_Baer |title=Primo Carnera vs. Max Baer\u2013 Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter that, Carnera won his next four fights, three of them as part of a South American tour that took him to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, as well as two exhibitions fought on the South American continent. But then, on 25 June 1935, he was knocked out in six rounds by [[Joe Louis]].\n\nFor the next two and a half years, he won five and lost three of eight total fights. But in 1938, Carnera, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], had to have a kidney removed, which forced him into retirement by 1944.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=179}} Carnera's record was 89 wins and 14 losses. His 72 wins by knockout made him a member of the exclusive club of boxers that won 50 or more bouts by knockout.\n\nCarnera died in 1967 in his native town of a combination of [[liver]] disease and complications from diabetes.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=7, 214}}\n\n====Legacy in boxing====\nCarnera was the third European to hold the world heavyweight championship after [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] and [[Max Schmeling]]. He would be the last until [[Ingemar Johansson]] claimed the title against [[Floyd Patterson]] in 1959, over a quarter of a century later.\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Tommy Loughran]] held the record for the greatest weight differential between two combatants in a world title fight ({{convert|86|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or}})<ref>{{cite news |title=TOMMY LOUGHRAN DIES AT 79 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/obituaries/tommy-loughran-dies-at-79.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 July 1982 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> for 73 years until the reign of [[Nikolai Valuev]], who owns the current record for the {{convert|105+1/2|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight advantage he held in his 2006 defense against [[Monte Barrett]].\n\nValuev also broke Carnera's record of {{convert|270|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to become the heaviest world champion in history, weighing as high as {{convert|328|lb|kg|abbr=on}} during his reign. Carnera still ranks as the second-heaviest, over eighty years after he held the title.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=209}}\n\nCarnera's 1933 title defense against [[Paulino Uzcudun]] in Italy was the first Heavyweight title fight to be held in Europe since [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s title defence against [[Frank Moran]] in Paris in 1913. It would be the last such occasion until [[Muhammad Ali]] defended the title against [[Henry Cooper]] in London in 1966. Carnera-Uzcudun was the first World Heavyweight championship fight to be contested between two Europeans. It was not until [[Lennox Lewis]] defended the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] heavyweight title against fellow-Englishman [[Frank Bruno]] in 1993, sixty years later, that this would occur again.\n\nTrailing only [[Ezzard Charles]] and his 95 wins, Carnera holds the second-most victories of all heavyweight champions with 88. Carnera's 71 career knockouts is the most of any world heavyweight champion.<ref>{{cite news |title=All-Time List: Most Career KOs By a Heavyweight Champ |url=https://www.boxingscene.com/all-time-list-most-career-kos-by-heavyweight-champ--50229 |work=Boxing Scene |date=3 March 2012 |access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Acting career===\nCarnera appeared in a short film in 1931. During his tenure as world champion he played a fictional version of himself in the 1933 film ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' starring Max Baer and [[Myrna Loy]]. Here he plays the heavyweight champion who barely holds onto his title with a draw decision after a furious fight with Baer. The film was made just the year before Carnera fought Baer for real, in a bout that was as wild as the film version, but ended with a knockout loss for Carnera.{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}}\n\nCarnera had a silent bit part in the 1949 movie [[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|''Mighty Joe Young'']].{{sfn|Page|2010|p=189}} He played himself in the tug-of-war scene with the giant gorilla. After being pulled by the ape into a pool of water, Carnera throws a couple of futile punches to Joe's chin.\n\nHe also played a bully boy wrestler in [[Carol Reed]]'s film [[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|''A Kid for Two Farthings'']] (1955) based around London's [[Petticoat Lane Market]] where he has a match against a local bodybuilder who is marrying [[Diana Dors]].\n\nPrimo appeared in at least ten Italian films between 1939 and 1943,<ref name=\"IMDM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138712/|title=Primo Carnera|publisher=}}</ref> as well as several in the 1950s, like [[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047365/|title=Prince Valiant|date=5 April 1954|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> in the role of Sligon. His last screen role was as the giant [[Antaeus]] alongside [[Steve Reeves]] in ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'' (USA title, filmed in Italy, 1959, original title ''Ercole e la regina di Lidia'').<ref name=\"IMDM2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052782/|title=Hercules Unchained|date=13 July 1960|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===Professional wrestling career===\nIn 1945 he temporarily returned to boxing and won two fights. But the next year, after three losses against [[Luigi Musina]] his talent for [[Professional wrestling|wrestling]] was discovered.

{"title_page": "Reynolds stress equation model", "text_new": "'''Reynolds stress equation model''' ('''RSM'''), also referred to as second moment closures are the most complete classical [[Turbulence modeling|turbulence model]]. In these models, the eddy-viscosity hypothesis is avoided and the individual components of the Reynolds stress tensor are directly computed. These models use the exact Reynolds stress transport equation for their formulation. They account for the directional effects of the Reynolds stresses and the complex interactions in turbulent flows. Reynolds stress models offer significantly better accuracy than eddy-viscosity based turbulence models, while being computationally cheaper than Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulations.\n\n== Shortcomings of Eddy-viscosity based models ==\nEddy-viscosity based models like the <math>k-\\epsilon</math> and the <math>k-\\omega</math> models have significant shortcomings in complex, real-life turbulent flows. For instance, in flows with streamline curvature, flow separation, flows with zones of re-circulating flow or flows influenced by mean rotational effects, the performance of these models is unsatisfactory.\n\nSuch one- and two-equation based closures cannot account for the return to isotropy of turbulence,<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Lumley\n | first = John\n | last2 = Newman\n | first2 = Gary\n | title = The return to isotropy of homogeneous turbulence\n | journal = Journal of Fluid Mechanics\n | volume = 82\n | pages =161\u2013178\n | date =1977\n | doi=10.1017/s0022112077000585\n | bibcode = 1977JFM....82..161L\n }}</ref> observed in decaying turbulent flows.

While the Production term (<math>P_{ij}</math>) is closed and does not require modelling, the other terms, like pressure strain correlation (<math>\\Pi_{ij}</math>) and dissipation (<math>\\varepsilon_{ij}</math>), are unclosed and require closure models.\n\n== Production term ==\n\nThe Production term that is used in CFD computations with Reynolds stress transport equations is\n\n:<math>P_{ij}</math> =<math> -\\left (R_{im}\\frac{\\partial U_{j}}{\\partial x_{m}}+R_{jm}\\frac{\\partial U_{i}}{\\partial x_{m}}\\right )</math>\n\nPhysically, the Production term represents the action of the mean velocity gradients working against the Reynolds stresses. This accounts for the transfer of kinetic energy from the mean flow to the fluctuating velocity field. It is responsible for sustaining the turbulence in the flow through this transfer of energy from the large scale mean motions to the small scale fluctuating motions.\n\nThis is the only term that is closed in the Reynolds Stress Transport Equations. It requires no models for its direct evaluation. All other terms in the Reynolds Stress Transport Equations are unclosed and require closure models for their evaluation.\n\n== Rapid Pressure-Strain Correlation term ==\n\nThe rapid pressure-strain correlation term redistributes energy among the Reynolds stresses components. This is dependent on the mean velocity gradient and rotation of the co-ordinate axes. Physically, this arises due to the interaction among the fluctuating velocity field and the mean velocity gradient field. The simplest linear form of the model expression is\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\Pi^{R}_{ij}}{k}=C_2 S_{ij} +C_3 (b_{ik}S_{jk}+b_{jk}S_{ik}-\\frac{2}{3}b_{mn}S_{mn}\\delta_{ij})+ C_4 (b_{ik}W_{jk} + b_{jk}W_{ik})</math>\n\nHere <math>b_{ij}=\\frac{\\overline{u_iu_j}}{2k}-\\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{3}</math> is the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, <math>S_{ij}</math> is the rate of strain term for the mean velocity field and <math>W_{ij}</math> is the rate of rotation term for the mean velocity field.

It was adapted into [[The Book Thief (film)|a 2013 feature film of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\n[Spoilers] Narrated by Death, who over the course of the book proves to be a morose yet caring character, the plot follows Liesel Meminger as she comes of age in Nazi Germany during WWII. After the death of her younger brother on a train to the fictional town of Molching, Germany on the outskirts of [[Munich]], Liesel arrives at the home of her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, distraught and withdrawn. During her time there, she is exposed to the horrors of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], caught between the innocence of childhood and the maturity demanded by her destructive surroundings. As the political situation in Germany deteriorates, her foster parents conceal a Jewish fist-fighter named Max Vandenburg. Hans, who has deved a close relationship with Liesel, teaches her to read, first in her bedroom, then in the basement. Recognizing the power of writing and sharing the written word, Liesel not only begins to steal books that the Nazi party is looking to destroy, but also writes her own story, and shares the power of language with Max. Through collecting laundry for her foster mother, she also begins a relationship with the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who allows her to first read books in her library, and later, to steal them.\n\nOne day, as a group of Jewish prisoners is led through town towards [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], Hans offers one particularly weak man a piece of bread, drawing the ire of others in the town. Max leaves the Hubermanns' home soon after out of fear that Hans' act will draw suspicion on the Hubernmanns household and their activities. Eventually, as punishment for this act, Hans' long-withheld application to join the NSDAP is approved and he is drafted into the army, cleaning up the aftermath of air raids on the German home front. A while later, Liesel sees Max among a group of prisoners and joins him in the march, ignoring a soldier's order to step away and getting whipped as punishment.\n\nAfter Hans' returns home, bombs fall on Liesel's street in Molching, killing every one of her friends, family, and neighbors. Liesel, working on her manuscript in the basement at the time of the raid, is the sole survivor. The workers searching for survivors and cleaning up the scene take Liesel's manuscript along with the rubble, but Death saves it. Devastated, Liesel is taken in by the Hermanns and refuses to clean the ashes off herself until she walks into the river where Rudy saved a book before, saying her final goodbyes to him. In 1945, Liesel works in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father when Max enters. They have an emotional reunion.\n\nMany years later, \"just yesterday\", Liesel dies as an old woman in the suburbs of [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], with a family and many friends, but has never forgotten Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and her brother. When Death collects her soul, he gives her the manuscript she lost in the bombing. She asks him if he read it and Death says yes. She asks him if he understood it, but Death is confused and unable to understand the duality of humanity. Death's last words are for both Liesel and the reader: \"I am haunted by humans.\"\n\n==Characters==\n===Death===\n[[Death (personification)|Death]], the collector of souls, arrayed in any or all the world's colors when it comes, narrates the story of a young girl coming of age during the horrific times of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[World War II]]. To the reader, Death insists that it \"most definitely ''can'' be cheerful\", even affable, but also relates that it most certainly cannot be nice. And sometimes Death is \"compelled\" to take action in sympathy with the human story. Death sees the colours around him before he sees anything else. The story is told from his point of view, over the three times he sees the main character Liesel Meminger.\n\n===Liesel Meminger===\n\nThe protagonist of the story is an adopted girl on the verge of adolescence, with blonde hair. Her eyes, however, are brown. She is fostered by the Hubermanns after her biological father \"abandons\" their family due to being a [[Communism|Communist]], her brother dies, and her mother is forced to send her to a foster home to avoid Nazi persecution.  Liesel is the \"book thief\" referred to in the title because Liesel is fascinated by the power of words. Liesel stole books from a grave digger, a bonfire and the mayor's wife, Ilsa Herman.\n\n===Hans Hubermann (Papa)===\n\nLiesel's foster father and husband of Rosa, Hans is a former German soldier during the First World War, accordion player, and painter. He develops a close and loving relationship with Liesel, and becomes a main source of strength and support for her. He, like Liesel, doesn't have much experience with reading. Together, the two help each other with reading and write all the words they learn on a wall in the basement. He helps Max because Max's father saved Hans in the First World War.\n\n===Rosa Hubermann (Mama)===\n\nRosa is Liesel's sharp-tongued foster mother. She has a \"wardrobe\" build and a displeased face, brown-grey tightly-cinched hair often tied up in a bun, and \"chlorinated\" eyes. Despite her temper, she is a loving wife to Hans and mother to Liesel. To supplement the household income, she does washing and ironing for five of the wealthier households in Molching. When she was introduced to Max the reader sees her soft side.\n\n===Rudy Steiner===\n\nLiesel's neighbor, Rudy, has bony legs, blue eyes, lemon-colored hair and a penchant for getting in the middle of situations when he shouldn't. Despite having the appearance of an archetypal German, he does not directly support the Nazis. As a member of a relatively poor household with six children, Rudy is habitually hungry. He is known throughout the neighborhood because of the \"[[Jesse Owens]] incident\", in which he colored himself black with charcoal one night and ran one hundred meters at the local sports field. He is academically and athletically gifted, which attracts the attention of Nazi Party officials, leading to an attempted recruitment. His lack of support for the Nazi party becomes problematic as the story progresses. Rudy becomes Liesel's best friend and falls in love with her, always trying to get a kiss out of her.<ref name=\"The Book Thief\">{{cite book|last1=Zusak|first1=Markus|title=The Book Thief|url=https://archive.org/details/bookthief00zusa|url-access=registration|date=2005|place=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]}}</ref>\n\n===Max Vandenburg===\n\nA Jewish fist-fighter who takes refuge from the Nazi regime in the Hubermann's basement. He is the son of a WWI German soldier who fought alongside Hans Hubermann, and the two developed a close friendship during the war. He has brown, feather-like hair and swampy brown eyes.  During the Nazi reign of terror, Hans agrees to shelter Max and hide him from the Nazi party. During his stay at the Hubermanns' house, Max befriends Liesel, because of their shared affinity for words. He writes two books for her and presents her with a sketchbook that contains his life story, which helps Liesel to develop as a writer and reader, which, in turn, saves her life from the bombs falling on her. <ref name=\"The Book Thief\"/>\n\n===Ilsa Hermann===\n\nThe wife of the mayor of Molching who employs Rosa Hubermann. She fell into a depression after the death of her only son in the Great War. Ilsa allows Liesel to visit, read and steal books in her personal library. She also gives Liesel a little black book, which leads Liesel to write her own story, \"The Book Thief\".<ref name=\"The Book Thief\"/>\n\n===Werner Meminger===\n\nLiesel's little brother, who died suddenly on the train with his mother and sister, while being transported to their foster parents. His death is what allowed the first book to be stolen, a gravedigger's manual dropped by a young boy learning to work in the cemetery. He died by coughing blood, corroded brown in colour.<ref name=\"The Book Thief\" />\n\n===Paula Meminger (Liesel's Mother)===\n\nLiesel's mother is only mentioned in the story a few times. Liesel's father was taken away by the Nazis prior to the novel starting because he was a Communist, and the reason her mother \u2013 Paula Meminger - was taking both her children to foster care was to save them from Nazi persecution. For a while Liesel writes letters to her mother thinking there is a chance she is still alive. Like Liesel's father, Liesel's mother dies, but Liesel eventually realizes her mother gave her away to protect her.<ref name=\"The Book Thief\" />\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Mortality===\nThe book is introduced by the character/narrator [[Death]], which underlines that mortality is very present in the lives of each character. Throughout the novel, the deaths of prominent characters reaffirm the presence of mortality. Because the novel takes place during [[World War II]], death and [[genocide]] are nearly omnipresent in the novel.\n\nDeath is presented in a manner that is less distant and threatening. Because Death narrates and explains the reasons behind each character's destruction, as well as explains how he feels that he must take the life of each character, Death is given a sense of care rather than fear. At one point, Death states \"even death has a heart,\" which reaffirms that there is a care present in the concept of death and dying.<ref name=\"Concept Analysis The Book Thief\">{{cite web|title=Concept Analysis The Book Thief|url=http://novelinks.org/uploads/Novels/TheBookThief/Concept%20Analysis%20Strategy.pdf|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Language, reading and writing===\nThroughout the novel, [[language]], [[reading]] and [[writing]] are presented as symbolic elements of expression and freedom. They provide identity and personal liberation to those characters who have, or who gain, the power of literacy: \"the true power of words\". And they provide a framework for Liesel's coming of age. At the beginning of the story shortly after her brother's funeral, Liesel finds a book in the snow, one she is unable to read. Under tutelage by her foster father Hans, she slowly learns to read and write. By the end of the novel, her character arc is largely defined by her progress in reading and writing. The development of Liesel's literacy mirrors her physical growth and maturing over the course of the story.\n\nLiteracy skills and vernacular speech also serve as social markers. Wealthy citizens in the story are often portrayed as literate, as owning books and even their own libraries, while the poor are illiterate and do not own books. Rosa Huberman's abrasive and oft-times scatological speech towards her family and others is emblematic of the despairing lives of the poorer classes.\n\nThe [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi burning of books]] in the story represents evil incarnate. Symbolically, Liesel's repeated rescues of books from Nazi bonfires represent her reclaiming of freedom and her resistance to being controlled by the all-pervasive state.<ref name=\"Concept Analysis The Book Thief\"/>\n\n===Love===\nIn the midst of the damage that war, death, and loss have caused Liesel and the other characters in the book, love is seen as an agent of change and freedom as love is the only way of forming a family where the real sovereign {{Clarify|date=March 2020}} exists. Liesel overcomes her traumas by learning to love and be loved by her foster family and her friends. In the beginning of the novel, Liesel is traumatized not only by the death of her brother and her separation from her only family, but also by the larger issues of war-torn Germany and the destruction wrought by the Nazi party. As Liesel's foster father Hans develops a relationship with her, this relationship helps create healing and growth. This pattern is reflected in the relational dynamic between the Hubermann family and Max. In a society ruled by governmental policies that presume to stand in judgment of who is truly human, the Hubermanns' relationship with Max defies the Nazi regime. Further, the love that Max and Liesel develop through their friendship creates a strong contrast to the fascist hate in the backdrop of the story.\n\nThe theme of love also intertwines with the themes of identity and language/reading because all of these themes have the purpose of providing freedom and power in the midst of chaos and control.<ref name=\"Concept Analysis The Book Thief\"/>\n\n==Recognition==\n* 2006: [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for Best Book (South East Asia & South Pacific)\n* 2006: ''[[School Library Journal]]'' Best Book of the Year\n* 2006: Daniel Elliott Peace Award\n* 2006: ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' Best Children's Book of the Year\n* 2006: [[National Jewish Book Award]] for Children's and Young Adult Literature<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners?year=2006|title=Past Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/book/the-book-thief |title= Fiction: The Book Thief|accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n* 2006: Bulletin Blue Ribbon Book<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 Blue Ribbons|url=http://bccb.lis.illinois.edu/BlueRibbons/blue06.html|publisher=The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n* 2007: [[Michael L.

Recognizing the power of writing and sharing the written word, Liesel not only begins to steal books that the Nazi party is looking to destroy, but also writes her own story, and shares the power of language with Max. Through collecting laundry for her foster mother, she also begins a relationship with the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who allows her to first read books in her library, and later, to steal them.\n\nOne day, as a group of Jewish prisoners is led through town towards [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], Hans offers one particularly weak man a piece of bread, drawing the ire of others in the town. Max leaves the Hubermanns' home soon after out of fear that Hans' act will draw suspicion on the Hubernmanns household and their activities. Eventually, as punishment for this act, Hans' long-withheld application to join the NSDAP is approved and he is drafted into the army, cleaning up the aftermath of air raids on the German home front. A while later, Liesel sees Max among a group of prisoners and joins him in the march, ignoring a soldier's order to step away and getting whipped as punishment.\n\nAfter Hans' returns home, bombs fall on Liesel's street in Molching, killing every one of her friends, family, and neighbors. Liesel, working on her manuscript in the basement at the time of the raid, is the sole survivor. The workers searching for survivors and cleaning up the scene take Liesel's manuscript along with the rubble, but Death saves it. Devastated, Liesel is taken in by the Hermanns and refuses to clean the ashes off herself until she walks into the river where Rudy saved a book before, saying her final goodbyes to him. In 1945, Liesel works in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father when Max enters. They have an emotional reunion.\n\nMany years later, \"just yesterday\", Liesel dies as an old woman in the suburbs of [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], with a family and many friends, but has never forgotten Hans, Rosa, Rudy, and her brother. When Death collects her soul, he gives her the manuscript she lost in the bombing. She asks him if he read it and Death says yes. She asks him if he understood it, but Death is confused and unable to understand the duality of humanity. Death's last words are for both Liesel and the reader: \"I am haunted by humans.\"\n\n==Characters==\n===Death===\n[[Death (personification)|Death]], the collector of souls, arrayed in any or all the world's colors when it comes, narrates the story of a young girl coming of age during the horrific times of [[Nazi Germany]] and [[World War II]]. To the reader, Death insists that it \"most definitely ''can'' be cheerful\", even affable, but also relates that it most certainly cannot be nice. And sometimes Death is \"compelled\" to take action in sympathy with the human story. Death sees the colours around him before he sees anything else. The story is told from his point of view, over the three times he sees the main character Liesel Meminger.\n\n===Liesel Meminger===\n\nThe protagonist of the story is an adopted girl on the verge of adolescence, with blonde hair. Her eyes, however, are brown. She is fostered by the Hubermanns after her biological father \"abandons\" their family due to being a [[Communism|Communist]], her brother dies, and her mother is forced to send her to a foster home to avoid Nazi persecution.  Liesel is the \"book thief\" referred to in the title because Liesel is fascinated by the power of words. Liesel stole books from a grave digger, a bonfire and the mayor's wife, Ilsa Herman.\n\n===Hans Hubermann (Papa)===\n\nLiesel's foster father and husband of Rosa, Hans is a former German soldier during the First World War, accordion player, and painter. He develops a close and loving relationship with Liesel, and becomes a main source of strength and support for her. He, like Liesel, doesn't have much experience with reading. Together, the two help each other with reading and write all the words they learn on a wall in the basement. He helps Max because Max's father saved Hans in the First World War.\n\n===Rosa Hubermann (Mama)===\n\nRosa is Liesel's sharp-tongued foster mother. She has a \"wardrobe\" build and a displeased face, brown-grey tightly-cinched hair often tied up in a bun, and \"chlorinated\" eyes. Despite her temper, she is a loving wife to Hans and mother to Liesel. To supplement the household income, she does washing and ironing for five of the wealthier households in Molching. When she was introduced to Max the reader sees her soft side.\n\n===Rudy Steiner===\n\nLiesel's neighbor, Rudy, has bony legs, blue eyes, lemon-colored hair and a penchant for getting in the middle of situations when he shouldn't. Despite having the appearance of an archetypal German, he does not directly support the Nazis. As a member of a relatively poor household with six children, Rudy is habitually hungry. He is known throughout the neighborhood because of the \"[[Jesse Owens]] incident\", in which he colored himself black with charcoal one night and ran one hundred meters at the local sports field. He is academically and athletically gifted, which attracts the attention of Nazi Party officials, leading to an attempted recruitment. His lack of support for the Nazi party becomes problematic as the story progresses. Rudy becomes Liesel's best friend and falls in love with her, always trying to get a kiss out of her.<ref name=\"The Book Thief\">{{cite book|last1=Zusak|first1=Markus|title=The Book Thief|url=https://archive.org/details/bookthief00zusa|url-access=registration|date=2005|place=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]}}</ref>\n\n===Max Vandenburg===\n\nA Jewish fist-fighter who takes refuge from the Nazi regime in the Hubermann's basement. He is the son of a WWI German soldier who fought alongside Hans Hubermann, and the two developed a close friendship during the war. He has brown, feather-like hair and swampy brown eyes.  During the Nazi reign of terror, Hans agrees to shelter Max and hide him from the Nazi party. During his stay at the Hubermanns' house, Max befriends Liesel, because of their shared affinity for words. He writes two books for her and presents her with a sketchbook that contains his life story, which helps Liesel to develop as a writer and reader, which, in turn, saves her life from the bombs falling on her. <ref name=\"The Book Thief\"/>\n\n===Ilsa Hermann===\n\nThe wife of the mayor of Molching who employs Rosa Hubermann. She fell into a depression after the death of her only son in the Great War. Ilsa allows Liesel to visit, read and steal books in her personal library. She also gives Liesel a little black book, which leads Liesel to write her own story, \"The Book Thief\".<ref name=\"The Book Thief\"/>\n\n===Werner Meminger===\n\nLiesel's little brother, who died suddenly on the train with his mother and sister, while being transported to their foster parents. His death is what allowed the first book to be stolen, a gravedigger's manual dropped by a young boy learning to work in the cemetery. He died by coughing blood, corroded brown in colour.<ref name=\"The Book Thief\" />\n\n===Paula Meminger (Liesel's Mother)===\n\nLiesel's mother is only mentioned in the story a few times. Liesel's father was taken away by the Nazis prior to the novel starting because he was a Communist, and the reason her mother \u2013 Paula Meminger - was taking both her children to foster care was to save them from Nazi persecution. For a while Liesel writes letters to her mother thinking there is a chance she is still alive. Like Liesel's father, Liesel's mother dies, but Liesel eventually realizes her mother gave her away to protect her.<ref name=\"The Book Thief\" />\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Mortality===\nThe book is introduced by the character/narrator [[Death]], which underlines that mortality is very present in the lives of each character. Throughout the novel, the deaths of prominent characters reaffirm the presence of mortality. Because the novel takes place during [[World War II]], death and [[genocide]] are nearly omnipresent in the novel.\n\nDeath is presented in a manner that is less distant and threatening. Because Death narrates and explains the reasons behind each character's destruction, as well as explains how he feels that he must take the life of each character, Death is given a sense of care rather than fear. At one point, Death states \"even death has a heart,\" which reaffirms that there is a care present in the concept of death and dying.<ref name=\"Concept Analysis The Book Thief\">{{cite web|title=Concept Analysis The Book Thief|url=http://novelinks.org/uploads/Novels/TheBookThief/Concept%20Analysis%20Strategy.pdf|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Language, reading and writing===\nThroughout the novel, [[language]], [[reading]] and [[writing]] are presented as symbolic elements of expression and freedom. They provide identity and personal liberation to those characters who have, or who gain, the power of literacy: \"the true power of words\". And they provide a framework for Liesel's coming of age. At the beginning of the story shortly after her brother's funeral, Liesel finds a book in the snow, one she is unable to read. Under tutelage by her foster father Hans, she slowly learns to read and write. By the end of the novel, her character arc is largely defined by her progress in reading and writing. The development of Liesel's literacy mirrors her physical growth and maturing over the course of the story.\n\nLiteracy skills and vernacular speech also serve as social markers. Wealthy citizens in the story are often portrayed as literate, as owning books and even their own libraries, while the poor are illiterate and do not own books. Rosa Huberman's abrasive and oft-times scatological speech towards her family and others is emblematic of the despairing lives of the poorer classes.\n\nThe [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi burning of books]] in the story represents evil incarnate. Symbolically, Liesel's repeated rescues of books from Nazi bonfires represent her reclaiming of freedom and her resistance to being controlled by the all-pervasive state.<ref name=\"Concept Analysis The Book Thief\"/>\n\n===Love===\nIn the midst of the damage that war, death, and loss have caused Liesel and the other characters in the book, love is seen as an agent of change and freedom as love is the only way of forming a family where the real sovereign {{Clarify|date=March 2020}} exists. Liesel overcomes her traumas by learning to love and be loved by her foster family and her friends. In the beginning of the novel, Liesel is traumatized not only by the death of her brother and her separation from her only family, but also by the larger issues of war-torn Germany and the destruction wrought by the Nazi party. As Liesel's foster father Hans develops a relationship with her, this relationship helps create healing and growth. This pattern is reflected in the relational dynamic between the Hubermann family and Max. In a society ruled by governmental policies that presume to stand in judgment of who is truly human, the Hubermanns' relationship with Max defies the Nazi regime. Further, the love that Max and Liesel develop through their friendship creates a strong contrast to the fascist hate in the backdrop of the story.\n\nThe theme of love also intertwines with the themes of identity and language/reading because all of these themes have the purpose of providing freedom and power in the midst of chaos and control.<ref name=\"Concept Analysis The Book Thief\"/>\n\n==Recognition==\n* 2006: [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for Best Book (South East Asia & South Pacific)\n* 2006: ''[[School Library Journal]]'' Best Book of the Year\n* 2006: Daniel Elliott Peace Award\n* 2006: ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' Best Children's Book of the Year\n* 2006: [[National Jewish Book Award]] for Children's and Young Adult Literature<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners?year=2006|title=Past Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/book/the-book-thief |title= Fiction: The Book Thief|accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n* 2006: Bulletin Blue Ribbon Book<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 Blue Ribbons|url=http://bccb.lis.illinois.edu/BlueRibbons/blue06.html|publisher=The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>\n* 2007: [[Michael L.
