He was a major [[Calvinist]] opponent of [[John Wesley]].  He is best remembered as the author of the hymn [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|\"Rock of Ages\"]].  Three of his other hymns \u2013 \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\", \"Deathless Principle, Arise\" and \"Object of My First Desire\" \u2013 are still occasionally sung today.\n\n==Background and early life, 1740\u201355==\nAugustus Toplady was born in [[Farnham]], Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in ''A Short Essay on Original Sin'', and in a public debate delivered a speech on ''Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?''. In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G.

Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the [[five points of Calvinism]].\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted'', adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of ''A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination''.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm ''A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work ''The Consequenses Proved'' that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.

His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]].

It was previously known as the Regional Special Events Center, or \"RSEC\", until the name was changed on September 17, 2010 following a $3.3 million donation from Community Financial Services Bank to Murray State Athletics. While the CFSB Center is commonly used for basketball, it was designed as a multi-purpose facility that also frequently hosts concerts, trade shows, and conventions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raceralumni.com/s/1165/NoRtCol.aspx?sid=1165&gid=1&pgid=252&cid=1911&ecid=1911&crid=0&calpgid=61&calcid=841 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715141942/http://www.raceralumni.com/s/1165/NoRtCol.aspx?sid=1165&gid=1&pgid=252&cid=1911&ecid=1911&crid=0&calpgid=61&calcid=841 |archivedate=2011-07-15 }} </ref><ref>[https://www.cfsbky.com/download.cfm?DownloadFile=21B34656-D8D5-5C68-3772525CDE210F2A ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133153/https://www.cfsbky.com/download.cfm?DownloadFile=21B34656-D8D5-5C68-3772525CDE210F2A |date=July 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rsec.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|left|RSEC as it appeared before naming rights were sold to CFSB]]\nThe Regional Special Events Center (RSEC) was built as a replacement for [[Racer Arena]], the school's former basketball arena. While Racer Arena was structurally sound (it still stands and is now used for volleyball), it was growing increasingly obsolete, and its capacity of 5,500 proved too small for the men's basketball program. Talk of a new basketball arena began around 1978, when the basketball program was beginning to make big strides toward success.  The project became reality in the early 1990s when the Kentucky General Assembly appropriated $18 million for construction of the project on the condition that the school would raise at least $2 million locally. Ground was broken in 1995; however, construction problems and cost overruns delayed completion of the facility until 1998 and pushed the total cost to $23 million for the {{convert|188800|sqft|adj=on}} facility.\n\nRSEC officially opened on September 12, 1998, but the first event was actually the Kentucky Baptist Youth Conference in June 1998, which took place before construction was completed.  [[Tim McGraw]] played the first concert at the facility on September 26, 1998 to a crowd of about 8,000 people.<ref>[http://www.murrayledger.com/articles/2008/10/18/top_story/news01.txt] {{dead link|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, new basketball locker rooms and a weight room were constructed in the Regional Special Events Center. Additional enhancements were implemented between August and September 2009, including a new playing floor and two wide screen video boards measuring {{convert|10|ft}} tall and {{convert|18|ft}} wide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2009/8/6/76532.aspx?path=mbball |title=Murray State University Racers Athletics - RSEC Begins Basketball Enhancements |publisher=Goracers.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\nCommunity Financial Services Bank made a $3.3 million donation to Murray State athletics in September 2010 in exchange for naming rights to the Regional Special Events Center. The name of the facility officially changed to the CFSB Center on September 17, 2010. Following the donation, Murray State also unveiled plans in January 2011 for facility expansion and upgrades to the CFSB Center. Since the building was constructed as a multi-purpose facility, the other events held at the CFSB Center often restrict the amount of court time available to the Murray State basketball teams. The expansion plan calls for a new practice facility attached to the CFSB Center that will give both men's and women's basketball teams unlimited access to courts. In addition to new practice space, the expansion will include new office space for basketball coaches. The university also has plans to construct luxury boxes for the CFSB Center and relocate the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame to the CFSB Center.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/sports/murray_state/planning-for-basketball-practice-facility-officially-underway/article_d2b29c94-2277-11e0-bd9a-001cc4c03286.html |title=Planning for basketball practice facility officially underway - Murray Ledger & Times: Murray State |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\nRelocation of the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame to the CFSB Center was completed in Summer 2011, and Hastings & Chivetta was selected as the architect for construction of the new practice facility and coaching office space. Construction work on the facility expansion was originally expected to begin by November 2011; however, it was delayed until after the nationally televised final home game of the 2011-12 men's basketball season against the nationally ranked [[Saint Mary's Gaels]]. Preliminary ground work on the CFSB Center expansion finally began in late February 2012. Construction of the practice facility and office space will add more than {{convert|18000|sqft}} of additional space to the CFSB Center. The construction contract was awarded to Pinnacle, Inc. of Benton, Kentucky. The addition to the CFSB Center is scheduled to open in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/sports/murray_state/murray-state-continues-work-on-improving-sports-facilities-hall-of/article_7dcfcc8e-abce-11e0-95e8-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Murray State continues work on improving sports facilities: Hall of Fame one of many items to receive face-lift - Murray Ledger & Times: Murray State |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://murrayledger.com/news/basketball-facility-work/image_54a9cca8-5ef5-11e1-9ca2-0019bb2963f4.html/?mode=gallery |title=Basketball Facility Work - Murray Ledger & Times: News |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://murrayledger.com/news/local/msu-basketball-facility-eyes-january-opening/article_f9318c2c-9b0c-11e1-9031-0019bb2963f4.html |title=MSU basketball facility eyes January opening - Murray Ledger & Times: Local News |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe CFSB Center uses a split-level concourse system, with the lower level section accessed through a lower level entrance (Quad A, Northeast Entrance just off Highway 121) and the upper level accessed through any entrance, primarily at the main entrance (Quad B, Southeast Entrance just off Gilbert Graves Drive).\n\n;Lower Level\nThe lower level is the main concourse and features street level access from two of the four gates located on Gilbert Graves and US Highway 121.  This level accesses sections 101 to 121. It is on this level where the main ticket box offices are located. The lower level also features VIP concessions, locker rooms, the Murray Room (a banquet-style or meeting space for up to 200 people), and the administrative offices.\n\n;Upper Level\nThe Upper level accesses sections 201 through 222, as well as standing room and four concessions areas. Surrounding the upper level is a four lane rubberized track.  The state-of-the-art rubberized floor provides a safe and comfortable indoor walking experience.  The track is available to Murray State students, faculty and staff, as well as the local community.  Just seven laps around the track is equal to one mile (1.6&nbsp;km).\n\n;Main Box Office\nThe CFSB Center is a Ticketmaster facility.  All tickets can be bought at the facility, or online.\n\n;Sports Medicine Room\nThis large area is dedicated solely to the care and health of MSU athletes.  It includes two general offices and a doctor's office, as well as a whirlpool room.\n\n;Weight Room\nThis room is utilized by the men's and women's basketball teams for strength training.  All athletes who utilize the weight room are in direct supervision of their trainer.\n\n;Officials Locker Rooms\nThese rooms not only serve as the place where officials will come to prepare for games, but also as production offices for concerts and other special events.  Road managers and the production staff have online access in these rooms.\n\n;Loading Dock Area\nBuilt for convenience and easy access, the loading dock area includes three bays that are large enough to drive three 18-wheelers through.  It also offers show power and enough shore power for four buses.\n\n==Basketball record crowds==\n[[File:2011 Murray State University Men's Basketball (5496482333).jpg|300px|thumb|right|View of the crowd inside the CFSB Center during a February 26, 2011 basketball game]]\nThe CFSB Center is one of the loudest arenas in college basketball.

While Racer Arena was structurally sound (it still stands and is now used for volleyball), it was growing increasingly obsolete, and its capacity of 5,500 proved too small for the men's basketball program. Talk of a new basketball arena began around 1978, when the basketball program was beginning to make big strides toward success.  The project became reality in the early 1990s when the Kentucky General Assembly appropriated $18 million for construction of the project on the condition that the school would raise at least $2 million locally. Ground was broken in 1995; however, construction problems and cost overruns delayed completion of the facility until 1998 and pushed the total cost to $23 million for the {{convert|188800|sqft|adj=on}} facility.\n\nRSEC officially opened on September 12, 1998, but the first event was actually the Kentucky Baptist Youth Conference in June 1998, which took place before construction was completed.  [[Tim McGraw]] played the first concert at the facility on September 26, 1998 to a crowd of about 8,000 people.<ref>[http://www.murrayledger.com/articles/2008/10/18/top_story/news01.txt] {{dead link|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, new basketball locker rooms and a weight room were constructed in the Regional Special Events Center. Additional enhancements were implemented between August and September 2009, including a new playing floor and two wide screen video boards measuring {{convert|10|ft}} tall and {{convert|18|ft}} wide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goracers.com/news/2009/8/6/76532.aspx?path=mbball |title=Murray State University Racers Athletics - RSEC Begins Basketball Enhancements |publisher=Goracers.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\nCommunity Financial Services Bank made a $3.3 million donation to Murray State athletics in September 2010 in exchange for naming rights to the Regional Special Events Center. The name of the facility officially changed to the CFSB Center on September 17, 2010. Following the donation, Murray State also unveiled plans in January 2011 for facility expansion and upgrades to the CFSB Center. Since the building was constructed as a multi-purpose facility, the other events held at the CFSB Center often restrict the amount of court time available to the Murray State basketball teams. The expansion plan calls for a new practice facility attached to the CFSB Center that will give both men's and women's basketball teams unlimited access to courts. In addition to new practice space, the expansion will include new office space for basketball coaches. The university also has plans to construct luxury boxes for the CFSB Center and relocate the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame to the CFSB Center.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/sports/murray_state/planning-for-basketball-practice-facility-officially-underway/article_d2b29c94-2277-11e0-bd9a-001cc4c03286.html |title=Planning for basketball practice facility officially underway - Murray Ledger & Times: Murray State |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\nRelocation of the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame to the CFSB Center was completed in Summer 2011, and Hastings & Chivetta was selected as the architect for construction of the new practice facility and coaching office space. Construction work on the facility expansion was originally expected to begin by November 2011; however, it was delayed until after the nationally televised final home game of the 2011-12 men's basketball season against the nationally ranked [[Saint Mary's Gaels]]. Preliminary ground work on the CFSB Center expansion finally began in late February 2012. Construction of the practice facility and office space will add more than {{convert|18000|sqft}} of additional space to the CFSB Center. The construction contract was awarded to Pinnacle, Inc. of Benton, Kentucky. The addition to the CFSB Center is scheduled to open in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/sports/murray_state/murray-state-continues-work-on-improving-sports-facilities-hall-of/article_7dcfcc8e-abce-11e0-95e8-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Murray State continues work on improving sports facilities: Hall of Fame one of many items to receive face-lift - Murray Ledger & Times: Murray State |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://murrayledger.com/news/basketball-facility-work/image_54a9cca8-5ef5-11e1-9ca2-0019bb2963f4.html/?mode=gallery |title=Basketball Facility Work - Murray Ledger & Times: News |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://murrayledger.com/news/local/msu-basketball-facility-eyes-january-opening/article_f9318c2c-9b0c-11e1-9031-0019bb2963f4.html |title=MSU basketball facility eyes January opening - Murray Ledger & Times: Local News |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe CFSB Center uses a split-level concourse system, with the lower level section accessed through a lower level entrance (Quad A, Northeast Entrance just off Highway 121) and the upper level accessed through any entrance, primarily at the main entrance (Quad B, Southeast Entrance just off Gilbert Graves Drive).\n\n;Lower Level\nThe lower level is the main concourse and features street level access from two of the four gates located on Gilbert Graves and US Highway 121.  This level accesses sections 101 to 121. It is on this level where the main ticket box offices are located. The lower level also features VIP concessions, locker rooms, the Murray Room (a banquet-style or meeting space for up to 200 people), and the administrative offices.\n\n;Upper Level\nThe Upper level accesses sections 201 through 222, as well as standing room and four concessions areas. Surrounding the upper level is a four lane rubberized track.  The state-of-the-art rubberized floor provides a safe and comfortable indoor walking experience.  The track is available to Murray State students, faculty and staff, as well as the local community.  Just seven laps around the track is equal to one mile (1.6&nbsp;km).\n\n;Main Box Office\nThe CFSB Center is a Ticketmaster facility.  All tickets can be bought at the facility, or online.\n\n;Sports Medicine Room\nThis large area is dedicated solely to the care and health of MSU athletes.  It includes two general offices and a doctor's office, as well as a whirlpool room.\n\n;Weight Room\nThis room is utilized by the men's and women's basketball teams for strength training.  All athletes who utilize the weight room are in direct supervision of their trainer.\n\n;Officials Locker Rooms\nThese rooms not only serve as the place where officials will come to prepare for games, but also as production offices for concerts and other special events.  Road managers and the production staff have online access in these rooms.\n\n;Loading Dock Area\nBuilt for convenience and easy access, the loading dock area includes three bays that are large enough to drive three 18-wheelers through.
