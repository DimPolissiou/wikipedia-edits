A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility.

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/><ref name=cdc-vacc/>  If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase,<ref name=fda-ddp/> and the progress of performance in humans &ndash; if a vaccine under development in the United States &ndash; is monitored by the FDA in a \"vaccine approval process.\"<ref name=\"fda-vacc\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Product Approval Process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trial phases===\n{{Main|Clinical trial}}\n\n[[Clinical trial]] programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=\"aziz\">{{cite web |last=Kaiser J. |first=Aziz |title=FDA update (2018) \u2013 The FDA's new drug approval process: Development and premarket applications |url=https://drug-dev.com/fda-update-the-fdas-new-drug-approval-process-development-premarket-applications/ |publisher=Drug Development and Delivery |accessdate=25 March 2020 |date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.\n* Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.\n* Phase III trials are [[Randomized controlled trial|large, pivotal trials]] to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage to begin marketing.<ref name=fda-ddp/>\n* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called [[post-market surveillance]] studies. Until a vaccine is provided to the general population, all potential [[adverse event]]s remain unidentified, requiring that vaccines undergo Phase IV studies with regular reports by the manufacturer to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) to identify problems after use in the population begins.<ref name=fda-vacc/>\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE is advanced into human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).<ref name=strovel/><ref name=fda-vacc/> If a vaccine candidate or antiviral compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the manufacturer can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be

It was registered in ''[[League of Nations]] [[Treaty Series]]'' on 7 September 1929.<ref>''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2094/v94.pdf vol. 94, pp. 66-74].</ref> The Geneva Protocol is a protocol to the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War signed on the same date, and followed the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]].\n\nIt prohibits the use of \"asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices\" and \"bacteriological methods of warfare\". This is now understood to be a general prohibition on chemical weapons and biological weapons, but has nothing to say about production, storage or transfer. Later treaties did cover these aspects \u2014 the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC) and the 1993 [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC).\n\nA number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying to other parties and that these obligations would cease to apply if the prohibited weapons were used against them.\n\nThe main elements of the protocol are now considered by many to be part of [[customary international law]].\n\n==Negotiation history==\n[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|British troops blinded by poison gas during the [[Battle of Estaires]], 1918]]\nIn the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], the use of dangerous chemical agents were outlawed. In spite of this, the [[First World War]] saw large-scale [[chemical warfare]]. [[French Third Republic|France]] used [[tear gas]] in 1914, but the first large-scale successful deployment of chemical weapons was by the [[German Empire]] in [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]] in 1915, when [[chlorine gas]] was released as part of a German attack at the [[Battle of Gravenstafel]]. Following this, a chemical [[arms race]] began, with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[United States]], and [[Italy]] joining France and Germany in the use of chemical weapons. This resulted in the development of a range of horrific chemicals affecting lungs, skin, or eyes. Some were intended to be lethal on the battlefield, like [[hydrogen cyanide]], and efficient methods of deploying agents were invented. At least 124,000 tons were produced during the war. In 1918, about one grenade out of three was filled with dangerous chemical agents. Around 1.3 million casualties of the conflict were attributed to the use of gas and the psychological effect on troops may have had a much greater effect.<ref name=\"FAB\">{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=24 August 2007 |pages=567\u2013570 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=0-8493-1434-8}}</ref> As protective equipment developed, the technology to destroy such equipment also became a part of the arms race. The use of deadly poison gas was not only limited to [[combatants]] in the front but also [[civilians]] as nearby civilian towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians living in towns rarely had any warning systems about the dangers of poison gas as well as not having access to effective [[gas masks]]. The use of chemical weapons employed by both sides had inflicted an estimated 100,000-260,000 [[civilian casualties]] during the conflict. Tens of thousands or more (along with [[military personnel]]) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. In the year 1920 alone, over 40,000 civilians and 20,000 military personnel died from the chemical weapons effects.<ref name=\"FAB\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=War Made New: Weapons, Warriors, and the Making of the Modern World |author=Max Boot |date=16 August 2007 |pages=245\u2013250 |publisher=Gotham |isbn=1-5924-0315-8}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] included some provisions that banned Germany from either manufacturing or importing chemical weapons. Similar treaties banned the [[First Austrian Republic]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] from chemical weapons, all belonging to the losing side, the [[Central powers]]. Russian [[bolshevik]]s and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] continued the [[Tambov Rebellion|use of chemical weapons]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[Alleged British use of chemical weapons in Mesopotamia in 1920|possibly in the Middle East]] in 1920.\n\nThree years after World War I, the Allies wanted to reaffirm the Treaty of Versailles, and in 1922 the [[United States]] introduced the Treaty relating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare at the [[Washington Naval Conference]].<ref name=ICRC-washington>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/270 |title=Treaty relating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] suggested the addition of bacteriological weapons.<ref>[http://www.the-trench.org/geneva-protocol-at-90-1/ ''The Geneva Protocol'']</ref> It was signed on 17 June.<ref name=coddy-2005/>\n\n==Violations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at a [[sarin]] production plant in 1970]]\nSeveral countries have deployed or prepared chemical weapons in spite of the treaty. [[Spain]] and [[France]] did so in [[Chemical weapons in the Rif War|the Rif War]] before the treaty came into effect in 1928, [[Japan]] used chemical weapons against [[Taiwan]] in 1930 during the [[Musha Incident|Wushe Massacre]], [[Italy]] used [[mustard gas]] against [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935]] and [[Japan]] used chemical weapons against [[China]] from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|1938 to 1941]].\n\nIn the [[Second World War]], the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|U.S.]], the [[Chemical weapons and the United Kingdom|UK]], and [[Sarin#History|Germany]] prepared the resources to deploy chemical weapons, stockpiling tons of them, but refrained from their use due to the [[balance of terror]]: the probability of horrific retaliation. There was an [[Air raid on Bari|accidental release of mustard gas in Bari, Italy]] causing many deaths when a U.S. ship carrying CW ammunition was sunk in the harbor during an air raid. After the war, thousands of tons of shells and containers with [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[sarin]] and other chemical weapons were disposed of at sea by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\nEarly in the [[Cold War]], the UK collaborated with the U.S. in the development of chemical weapons. The [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|Soviet Union]] also had the facilities to produce chemical weapons but their development was kept secret.\n\nDuring the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, Iraq is known to have employed a variety of chemical weapons against Iranian forces, as well as nerve agents against Kurdish civilians, the most notorious example of which was 1988 attack on Halabja.\n\nBoth the [[Syrian government]] and [[Syrian opposition|opposition forces]] accused each other of using chemical weapons in 2013 in [[2013 Ghouta attacks|Ghouta]] and [[Khan al-Assal chemical attack|Khan al-Assal]] during the [[Syrian civil war]], though as any such use would be within [[Syria]]'s own borders, rather than in warfare between state parties to the protocol, the legal situation is less certain.<ref name=\"vertic-20120808\" /> A 2013 [[United Nations]] report confirmed the use of sarin, but did not investigate which side used chemical weapons.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE98F0ED20130916# U.N. confirms sarin used in Syria attack; U.S., UK, France blame Assad]</ref> In 2014, the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] confirmed the use of [[chlorine gas]] in the Syrian villages of Talmanes, Al Tamanah and [[2014 Kafr Zita chemical attack|Kafr Zeta]], but did not say which side used the gas.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11088205/Syria-chemical-weapons-watchdog-confirms-Telegraph-analysis-of-chlorine-gas-attacks-on-civilians.html Syria chemical weapons: watchdog confirms Telegraph analysis of chlorine gas attacks on civilians]</ref>\n\n==Historical assessment==\nEric Croddy, assessing the Protocol in 2005, took the view that the historic record showed it had been largely ineffectual.

In 1969, United Nations General Assembly resolution 2603 (XXIV) declared that the prohibition on use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts, as embodied in the protocol (though restated in a more general form), were generally recognized rules of international law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/1969/110.pdf |title=2603 (XXIV).

In 1995, an appellate chamber in the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] stated that \"there had undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of chemical weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts.\" In 2005, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] concluded that customary international law includes a ban on the use of chemical weapons in internal as well as international conflicts.<ref name=vertic-20120808>{{cite web |url=http://www.vertic.org/pages/posts/syria-international-law-and-the-use-of-chemical-weapons-345.php |title=Syria: international law and the use of chemical weapons |author=Scott Spence and Meghan Brown |publisher=[[VERTIC]] |date=8 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==State parties==\n[[File:Geneva Protocol parties.svg|right|400px|thumb|Parties to the Geneva Protocol<br/>{{legend|#00AA00|Parties with no reservations}} {{legend|#0000FF|Parties with withdrawn reservations}} {{legend|#EEEE00|Parties with implicit reservations}} {{legend|orange|Parties with unwithdrawn reservations limiting the applicability of provisions of the Protocol}} {{legend|#FF1111|Non-parties}}]]\n\nTo become party to the Protocol, states must deposit an instrument with the government of [[France]] (the [[depositary]] power). Thirty-eight states originally signed the Protocol. France was the first signatory to ratify the Protocol on 10 May 1926. El Salvador, the final signatory to ratify the Protocol, did so on 26 February 2008.

Several Arab states also declared that their ratification did not constitute recognition of, or diplomatic relations with, [[Israel]], or that the provision of the Protocol were not binding with respect to Israel. Generally, reservations not only modify treaty provisions for the reserving party, but also symmetrically modify the provisions for previously ratifying parties in dealing with the reserving party.<ref name=bunn-1969/>{{rp|394}}  Subsequently, numerous states have withdrawn their reservations, including the former [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1990 prior to its [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|dissolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/a/1925/czechrepublic/suc/paris|title=Czech Republic: Succession to 1925 Geneva Protocol\n|accessdate=2014-07-26|publisher=[[United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs]]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties]], states which succeed to a treaty after gaining independence from a state party \"shall be considered as maintaining any reservation to that treaty which was applicable at the date of the succession of States in respect of the territory to which the succession of States relates unless, when making the notification of succession, it expresses a contrary intention or formulates a reservation which relates to the same subject matter as that reservation.\"  While some states have explicitly either retained or renounced their reservations inherited on succession, states which have not clarified their position on their inherited reservations are listed as \"implicit\" reservations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Party<ref name=dep/><ref name=unoda/><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/fr/dfae/politique-exterieure/droit-international-public/traites-internationaux/banque-donnees-traites-internationaux/detailansicht-staatsvertrag.ggst0_51.contract19250020.html?_charset_=UTF-8|title=Le trait\u00e9 international en detail|accessdate=2018-05-21|publisher=[[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs|Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland]]}}</ref><ref name=usdos>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/4784.htm|title=Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Geneva Protocol)|accessdate=31 July 2013|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref><ref name=ICRC>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&xp_treatySelected=280 |title=Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare.

of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare''', usually called the '''Geneva Protocol''', is a [[treaty]] prohibiting the use of [[chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]] in international [[armed conflicts]]. It was signed at [[Geneva]] on 17 June 1925 and entered into force on 8 February 1928. It was registered in ''[[League of Nations]] [[Treaty Series]]'' on 7 September 1929.<ref>''League of Nations Treaty Series'', [https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2094/v94.pdf vol. 94, pp. 66-74].</ref> The Geneva Protocol is a protocol to the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War signed on the same date, and followed the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]].\n\nIt prohibits the use of \"asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices\" and \"bacteriological methods of warfare\". This is now understood to be a general prohibition on chemical weapons and biological weapons, but has nothing to say about production, storage or transfer. Later treaties did cover these aspects \u2014 the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC) and the 1993 [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC).\n\nA number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying to other parties and that these obligations would cease to apply if the prohibited weapons were used against them.\n\nThe main elements of the protocol are now considered by many to be part of [[customary international law]].\n\n==Negotiation history==\n[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|British troops blinded by poison gas during the [[Battle of Estaires]], 1918]]\nIn the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], the use of dangerous chemical agents were outlawed. In spite of this, the [[First World War]] saw large-scale [[chemical warfare]]. [[French Third Republic|France]] used [[tear gas]] in 1914, but the first large-scale successful deployment of chemical weapons was by the [[German Empire]] in [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]] in 1915, when [[chlorine gas]] was released as part of a German attack at the [[Battle of Gravenstafel]]. Following this, a chemical [[arms race]] began, with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[United States]], and [[Italy]] joining France and Germany in the use of chemical weapons. This resulted in the development of a range of horrific chemicals affecting lungs, skin, or eyes. Some were intended to be lethal on the battlefield, like [[hydrogen cyanide]], and efficient methods of deploying agents were invented. At least 124,000 tons were produced during the war. In 1918, about one grenade out of three was filled with dangerous chemical agents. Around 1.3 million casualties of the conflict were attributed to the use of gas and the psychological effect on troops may have had a much greater effect.<ref name=\"FAB\">{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=24 August 2007 |pages=567\u2013570 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=0-8493-1434-8}}</ref> As protective equipment developed, the technology to destroy such equipment also became a part of the arms race. The use of deadly poison gas was not only limited to [[combatants]] in the front but also [[civilians]] as nearby civilian towns were at risk from winds blowing the poison gases through. Civilians living in towns rarely had any warning systems about the dangers of poison gas as well as not having access to effective [[gas masks]]. The use of chemical weapons employed by both sides had inflicted an estimated 100,000-260,000 [[civilian casualties]] during the conflict. Tens of thousands or more (along with [[military personnel]]) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. In the year 1920 alone, over 40,000 civilians and 20,000 military personnel died from the chemical weapons effects.<ref name=\"FAB\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=War Made New: Weapons, Warriors, and the Making of the Modern World |author=Max Boot |date=16 August 2007 |pages=245\u2013250 |publisher=Gotham |isbn=1-5924-0315-8}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] included some provisions that banned Germany from either manufacturing or importing chemical weapons. Similar treaties banned the [[First Austrian Republic]], the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] from chemical weapons, all belonging to the losing side, the [[Central powers]]. Russian [[bolshevik]]s and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] continued the [[Tambov Rebellion|use of chemical weapons]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] and [[Alleged British use of chemical weapons in Mesopotamia in 1920|possibly in the Middle East]] in 1920.\n\nThree years after World War I, the Allies wanted to reaffirm the Treaty of Versailles, and in 1922 the [[United States]] introduced the Treaty relating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare at the [[Washington Naval Conference]].<ref name=ICRC-washington>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/270 |title=Treaty relating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] suggested the addition of bacteriological weapons.<ref>[http://www.the-trench.org/geneva-protocol-at-90-1/ ''The Geneva Protocol'']</ref> It was signed on 17 June.<ref name=coddy-2005/>\n\n==Violations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at a [[sarin]] production plant in 1970]]\nSeveral countries have deployed or prepared chemical weapons in spite of the treaty. [[Spain]] and [[France]] did so in [[Chemical weapons in the Rif War|the Rif War]] before the treaty came into effect in 1928, [[Japan]] used chemical weapons against [[Taiwan]] in 1930 during the [[Musha incident|Wushe Massacre]], [[Italy]] used [[mustard gas]] against [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] in [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935]] and [[Japan]] used chemical weapons against [[China]] from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|1938 to 1941]].\n\nIn the [[Second World War]], the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|U.S.]], the [[Chemical weapons and the United Kingdom|UK]], and [[Sarin#History|Germany]] prepared the resources to deploy chemical weapons, stockpiling tons of them, but refrained from their use due to the [[balance of terror]]: the probability of horrific retaliation. There was an [[Air raid on Bari|accidental release of mustard gas in Bari, Italy]] causing many deaths when a U.S. ship carrying CW ammunition was sunk in the harbor during an air raid. After the war, thousands of tons of shells and containers with [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], [[sarin]] and other chemical weapons were disposed of at sea by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\nEarly in the [[Cold War]], the UK collaborated with the U.S. in the development of chemical weapons. The [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|Soviet Union]] also had the facilities to produce chemical weapons but their development was kept secret.\n\nDuring the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, Iraq is known to have employed a variety of chemical weapons against Iranian forces, as well as nerve agents against Kurdish civilians, the most notorious example of which was 1988 attack on Halabja.\n\nBoth the [[Syrian government]] and [[Syrian opposition|opposition forces]] accused each other of using chemical weapons in 2013 in [[2013 Ghouta attacks|Ghouta]] and [[Khan al-Assal chemical attack|Khan al-Assal]] during the [[Syrian civil war]], though as any such use would be within [[Syria]]'s own borders, rather than in warfare between state parties to the protocol, the legal situation is less certain.<ref name=\"vertic-20120808\" /> A 2013 [[United Nations]] report confirmed the use of sarin, but did not investigate which side used chemical weapons.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-syria-crisis-un-idUSBRE98F0ED20130916# U.N. confirms sarin used in Syria attack; U.S., UK, France blame Assad]</ref> In 2014, the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] confirmed the use of [[chlorine gas]] in the Syrian villages of Talmanes, Al Tamanah and [[2014 Kafr Zita chemical attack|Kafr Zeta]], but did not say which side used the gas.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11088205/Syria-chemical-weapons-watchdog-confirms-Telegraph-analysis-of-chlorine-gas-attacks-on-civilians.html Syria chemical weapons: watchdog confirms Telegraph analysis of chlorine gas attacks on civilians]</ref>\n\n==Historical assessment==\nEric Croddy, assessing the Protocol in 2005, took the view that the historic record showed it had been largely ineffectual.

In 1969, United Nations General Assembly resolution 2603 (XXIV) declared that the prohibition on use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts, as embodied in the protocol (though restated in a more general form), were generally recognized rules of international law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/UNGARsn/1969/110.pdf |title=2603 (XXIV).

Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, but it does require case-by-case consideration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule76 |title=Practice Relating to Rule 76.

In 1995, an appellate chamber in the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] stated that \"there had undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of chemical weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts.\" In 2005, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] concluded that customary international law includes a ban on the use of chemical weapons in internal as well as international conflicts.<ref name=vertic-20120808>{{cite web |url=http://www.vertic.org/pages/posts/syria-international-law-and-the-use-of-chemical-weapons-345.php |title=Syria: international law and the use of chemical weapons |author=Scott Spence and Meghan Brown |publisher=[[VERTIC]] |date=8 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==State parties==\n[[File:Geneva Protocol parties.svg|right|400px|thumb|Parties to the Geneva Protocol<br/>{{legend|#00AA00|Parties with no reservations}} {{legend|#0000FF|Parties with withdrawn reservations}} {{legend|#EEEE00|Parties with implicit reservations}} {{legend|orange|Parties with unwithdrawn reservations limiting the applicability of provisions of the Protocol}} {{legend|#FF1111|Non-parties}}]]\n\nTo become party to the Protocol, states must deposit an instrument with the government of [[France]] (the [[depositary]] power). Thirty-eight states originally signed the Protocol. France was the first signatory to ratify the Protocol on 10 May 1926.

Several Arab states also declared that their ratification did not constitute recognition of, or diplomatic relations with, [[Israel]], or that the provision of the Protocol were not binding with respect to Israel. Generally, reservations not only modify treaty provisions for the reserving party, but also symmetrically modify the provisions for previously ratifying parties in dealing with the reserving party.<ref name=bunn-1969/>{{rp|394}}  Subsequently, numerous states have withdrawn their reservations, including the former [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1990 prior to its [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|dissolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/a/1925/czechrepublic/suc/paris|title=Czech Republic: Succession to 1925 Geneva Protocol\n|accessdate=2014-07-26|publisher=[[United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs]]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties]], states which succeed to a treaty after gaining independence from a state party \"shall be considered as maintaining any reservation to that treaty which was applicable at the date of the succession of States in respect of the territory to which the succession of States relates unless, when making the notification of succession, it expresses a contrary intention or formulates a reservation which relates to the same subject matter as that reservation.\"  While some states have explicitly either retained or renounced their reservations inherited on succession, states which have not clarified their position on their inherited reservations are listed as \"implicit\" reservations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Party<ref name=dep/><ref name=unoda/><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/fr/dfae/politique-exterieure/droit-international-public/traites-internationaux/banque-donnees-traites-internationaux/detailansicht-staatsvertrag.ggst0_51.contract19250020.html?_charset_=UTF-8|title=Le trait\u00e9 international en detail|accessdate=2018-05-21|publisher=[[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs|Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland]]}}</ref><ref name=usdos>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/4784.htm|title=Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Geneva Protocol)|accessdate=31 July 2013|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]}}</ref><ref name=ICRC>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&xp_treatySelected=280 |title=Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare.

Its roof has deep eaves with applied decorative elements, and exposed rafter ends in the eaves.  The front  is adorned by a gable dormer, polygonal bay, and porch, all with bracketed gable roofs.
