[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The earliest [[fossil]]s associated with the family are two species from the genus ''[[Pelargopappus]]''. The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family.

They can breed at any time of the year, more frequently in the late dry season. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing each other with their wings up and back, much like the way they defend their territory.

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].<ref name=hackett2008/><ref name=ioc/>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:340px;\n|1={{clade\n   |1=[[Cathartidae]] \u2013 New World vultures (7 species)\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Sagittariidae]] \u2013 '''Secretarybird'''\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Pandionidae]] \u2013 Ospreys (2 species)\n            |2=[[Accipitridae]] \u2013 Kites, hawks and eagles (256 species)\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n  }}\n}}\nThe German biologist Ragnar Kinzelbach has proposed that the secretarybird was depicted as ''bistarda deserti'' in the 13th century work ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' penned by Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

The two species, from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France.

Although secretarybirds normally build their nests in the trees in the wild, the captive birds at the zoo built theirs on the ground, which left them open to depredation by local wild mammals.

Their crest feathers may raise during a hunt, which may serve to help scare the target and provide shade for the face.<ref name=hbwfamily/> A bird will chase after prey with the wings spread and kill by striking with swift blows of the feet. Only with small prey items such as wasps will the bird use its bill to pick prey items directly. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, a secretarybird will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will hold down a food item with their feet while tearing it apart with their bill.<ref name=hbwfamily/>\n\nFood that cannot be digested is regurgitated as pellets {{cvt|40|-|45|mm}} in diameter and {{cvt|30|-|100|mm}} in length.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency. As secretarybirds are anatomically similar (but apparently not closely related) to the extinct [[Phorusrhacidae]], it has been hypothesised that these birds may have employed a similar hunting technique.<ref name=portugal /><!-- cites previous 6 sentences -->\n\nSecretarybirds rarely encounter other predators, expect in the case of [[tawny eagle]]s which will [[Kleptoparasitism|steal their kills]].
