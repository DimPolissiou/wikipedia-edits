This version was slightly modified for the 1991 album ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'', discarding the responses in the second verse. Released as the second single from the album, it reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the [[New Zealand Singles Chart]]. Elsewhere, the single topped the charts of Belgium and the Netherlands; it was the best-selling song of 1992 in the latter country.

Released as the second single from the album, it reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the [[New Zealand Singles Chart]].

During the war, the copper mines supplied about 90% of the Confederacy's copper; their capture after the Confederate defeat at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battles for Chattanooga]] in November 1863 proved a major blow to the Confederacy.

Gatewood in Polk County resulted in at least 16 deaths.<ref name=tnencyc/>\n\nThe East Tennessee Power Company, later the [[Tennessee Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO), constructed two [[hydroelectric dam]]s on the Ocoee River, Ocoee Dams [[Ocoee Dam No. 1|1]] and [[Ocoee Dam No. 2|2]], which were completed in 1911 and 1913, respectively.<ref>James B.

Manifest Inc. to take place on a 1,300 acre farm north of Benton on Labor Day of that year owned by the then county executive. Nicknamed \"Polkstock\" due to its resemblance to 1969's [[Woodstock]] in [[Bethel, New York]], the event was expected to attract approximately 500,000 and was strongly opposed by locals, especially the religious community, who believed the festival would bring much of the perceived rock music culture. The festival was eventually shut down by the state circuit court, on the request of the district attorney, that the festival would constitute a public nuisance, due to drug, health, and traffic problems.<ref>{{cite news|date=August 24, 1973|title=Judge Orders Festival Halted|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/69618535/|work=[[Kingsport Times-News]]|location=Kingsport, Tennessee|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n\nOn May 27, 1983, a [[Benton fireworks disaster|massive explosion]] at a secret illegal [[fireworks]] factory killed eleven workers.

This operation continued until 1987, when the last mine closed.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Polk County was one of only six counties in [[East Tennessee]] to support the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], voting in favor of Tennessee's ordinance of secession in June 1861. During the war, the copper mines supplied about 90% of the Confederacy's copper; their capture after the Confederate defeat at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battles for Chattanooga]] in November 1863 proved a major blow to the Confederacy. On November 29, 1864, a series of raids by Confederate bushwhacker John P. Gatewood in Polk County resulted in at least 16 deaths.<ref name=tnencyc/>\n\nThe East Tennessee Power Company, later the [[Tennessee Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO), constructed two [[hydroelectric dam]]s on the Ocoee River, Ocoee Dams [[Ocoee Dam No. 1|1]] and [[Ocoee Dam No. 2|2]], which were completed in 1911 and 1913, respectively.<ref>James B.

Nicknamed \"Polkstock\" due to its resemblance to 1969's [[Woodstock]] in [[Bethel, New York]], the event was expected to attract approximately 500,000 and was strongly opposed by locals, especially the religious community, who believed the festival would bring much of the perceived rock music culture.

Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].\n\nIn the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.<ref name=Sarat >Sarat, Austin and Hussain, Nasser.

It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as \"the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it.\"<ref>Locke, John.

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevi\u0107i, [[Mora\u010dani]], [[Rov\u010dani]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Ku\u010di]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i (clan)|Bjelopavli\u0107i]]). Vasojevi\u0107i is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevi\u0107i. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojevi\u0107 tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru\u017eenje Vasojevi\u0107a \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]] with the Vasojevi\u0107i united opposition.\n\n==Geography==\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevi\u0107i dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people).

It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East. The tribe (''pleme'') is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevi\u0107i, [[Mora\u010dani]], [[Rov\u010dani]], [[Bratono\u017ei\u0107i]], [[Ku\u010di]], [[Piperi clan|Piperi]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i (clan)|Bjelopavli\u0107i]]). Vasojevi\u0107i is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevi\u0107i. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through [[oral history]].\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is [[Andrijevica]] in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojevi\u0107 tribe. These tribes later migrated to the [[Komovi Mountains|Komovi]] mountains and the area of [[Lim River|Lim]]. The emigration continued into what is today [[Serbia]] and other parts of [[Montenegro]].\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udru\u017eenje Vasojevi\u0107a \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]] with the Vasojevi\u0107i united opposition.\n\n==Geography==\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and [[Bihor (region)|Bihor]] under [[Bijelo Polje]] in the North, [[Mate\u0161evo]] in the West to [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] in the East.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevi\u0107i dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people).

The legend also recounts how after the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]], defeated [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]] (Sibinjanin Janko in [[Serbian epic poetry]]) along with his wounded (according to some traditions already dead) nephew Banovac Sekula retreated to the safety of the high Komovi mountains. There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon. Hynadi blessed him for this, and predicted that he and his brothers will be great heroes, as well as their descendants, but that his own will always be the largest and that they will always be the leaders of the tribe.    \n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\nRajevi\u0107i is the biggest branch.
