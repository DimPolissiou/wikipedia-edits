There are as many versions of this lineage as there are sources for them. The main source is the Sangam literature \u2013 particularly, religious literature such as ''Periapuranam'', semi-biographical poems of the later Chola period such as the temple and cave inscription and left by medieval Cholas.\n\nIrrespective of the source, no list of the kings has a high level of historic fact and, while they generally are similar to each other, no two lists are exactly the same. Modern historians{{Who|date=January 2016}} consider these lists not as historically reliable sources but as comprehensive conglomerations of various Hindu deities and Puranic characters attributed to local chieftains and invented ancestry of dynasty attempting to re-establish their legitimacy and supremacy in a land they were trying to conquer.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the region begins with the rise of the [[Early Cholas|Early Chola kingdom]] in the 4th century BC. The Early Cholas ruled from the town of [[Uraiyur]] near Tiruchirapalli and their kingdom comprised the whole of the present-day Cauvery Delta. Flourishing centres of Roman trade have been excavated at [[Poompuhar]] stand testimony to a prosperous civilization.\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Chola Nadu region is renowned as a hub of Tamil culture and civilization. The region has been continuously inhabited since the 1st millennium BC. Arts, crafts and music flourished under the Cholas whose reign is considered to be the golden age in the history of Tamil Nadu. During the hegemony of the Vijayanagar Empire and its successors, the zThanjavur Nayak kingdom, there were frequent migrations of priests, administrators, soldiers and artists from the Telugu and Kannada districts of the north who brought in their traditions, art and dance forms. Despite its rise and initial success in the northern part of Karnataka, Carnatic music actually flourished in the Cauvery Delta. [[Kambar (poet)]] was a renowned medieval Tamil poet and the author of the [[Ramavataram]], popularly known as [[Kambaramayanam]], the Tamil version of [[Ramayana]]. [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] also authored other literary works in Tamil, such as 'Thirukkai Vazakkam',Erezhupathu, Silaiezhupathu, Kangai Puranam, sadagopar anthathi, and Sarasvati Anthati hails from the Cauvery Delta region. The three great Carnatic music composers, [[Tyagaraja]], [[Syama Sastri]] and [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] who form the Great Trinity of Carnatic music hailed from the Chola Nadu region as also the music composers [[Muthu Thandavar]], [[Arunachala Kavi]] and [[Marimutthu Pillai]] who form the Tamil Trinity of Carnatic music.\n\nApart from music, dance and drama have also flourished in the Cauvery Delta. The Bhagavathar Melas, a series of dance-dramas, written almost entirely in Telugu, were introduced by migrants who sought refuge in the town of [[Melattur, Tamil Nadu|Melattur]] following the collapse of the Vijayanagar kingdom at the [[Battle of Talikota]].\n\nBharatanatyam, a popular dance form by Bharatha muni, flourished in the dance of ''sadir'' which was practised in the temples of Chola Nadu by ritual temple dances or ''devadasis''. Patronized and financed by dharmakarthas and rich mirasidars, ''sadir'' was popular until the early years of the 20th century when a strong voiced campaign resulted in the devadasi practised being outlawed. Sadir has, since, purged itself of its erotic symbolism and movements and gradually evolved into the commoners' dance Bharathanatyam.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe Chola Nadu region had a population of over 10 million with a density of above 400 persons per square kilometre in 2001. Due to fertile soil and favourable climate, the region has been the most densely populated in the Tamil country since ancient times.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the population speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. There is a significant [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking minority, who had descended from migrants who had mostly moved in during the Vijayanagar and [[Thanjavur Nayak]] periods. There are smaller populations speaking [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Saurashtra language|Saurashtra]] and [[Urdu]]. There are also a considerable body of [[Thanjavur Marathi (language)|Marathi]] speaking people who are mostly present in the urban areas of [[Thanjavur District]] and the city of [[Tiruchirappalli]].\n\n== Important Personalities ==\n\nThe Chola Nadu region has produced a number of noteworthy personalities in the fields of arts, science, film and politics. Long recognized as a hub of Carnatic music, the region is home to most of India's renowned Carnatic musicians. There have also been important individuals in the field of politics.

Muthuswamy Iyer]], [[Sir P. S. Sivaswami Iyer]], [[T. Ananda Rao]], [[S. Satyamurti]], [[V. S. Srinivasa Sastri]], [[V. P. Madhava Rao]] and [[R. Raghunatha Rao]] dominated the bureaucracy.

The temples were built in the garden where, according to Hindu mythology, Ram and Sita spent a night while on their way to Hinglaj for offering thanks, after Ram completed 14 years of exile in the jungle with Lakshman and Sita, following court intrigues. Till the 20th century, the area was called Rambagh. It was converted into a refugee camp after 1947 and named Arambagh. ... According to Hasan, Hinglaj is one of the seven places most sacred to Hindu. In fact, lore has it that after Ram rescued Sita from the demon king Ravana, they went to the Mahadev temple in Karachi and spent a night at this Bagh hence the name. After that Rambagh became a place of pilgrimage too, Hasan said. Karachi itself is also known as Ramya in some Greek texts, he added.

[[Overseas Minangkabau]] leave their home town to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighbouring countries, and [[Padang food|Padang restaurants]], Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularised rendang and other [[Padang food]] dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.\n\n[[Andalas University]] historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in the 16th century, \"Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.\"<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/> The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Nasi ramas rendang.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi ramas padang'', rendang served with [[steamed rice]], [[cassava]] leaf, [[egg]] and ''[[gulai]]'' sauce in [[Surabaya]] \u2013 [[Indonesia]].]]\nIn Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: ''[[Gulai]] \u2014 Kalio \u2013 Rendang''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Dian Kelana | title=Gulai, Kalio, atau Rendang? | publisher=Kompasiana | date=17 March 2010 | url=http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | language=Indonesian | accessdate=14 September 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914201307/http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | archivedate=14 September 2014 }}</ref> The ingredients of ''gulai'', ''kalio'' and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that ''gulai'' usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\n\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called ''gulai''. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called ''kalio''. For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: ''gulai'' is light yellow, ''kalio'' is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\n\n===Dried rendang===\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended and cooked for hours until the coconut milk evaporated and the meat absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honour guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored in room temperature and still good to consume.<ref name=\"William Wongso\" /> It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.\n\n===Wet rendang or ''kalio''===\n[[File:Rendang dish closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Most rendang in the Netherlands is actually a ''kalio'' because it still contains some liquid]]\nWet rendang, more accurately identified as ''kalio'', is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. If stored at room temperature, ''kalio'' lasts less than a week.<ref name=\"Lipoeto2001\"/> Kalio usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Rendang hati.JPG|thumb|right|Beef liver rendang]]\nRendang is made from beef (or occasionally [[beef liver]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[mutton]], [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], or vegetables like [[jackfruit]] or [[cassava]]). Chicken or duck rendang also contains [[tamarind]] and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesian Regional Food and Cookery |last=Owen |first=Sri |publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd |year=1999 |isbn=0-7112-1273-2}}</ref>\n\nThe original Indonesian-Minangkabau rendang has two categories, ''rendang darek'' and ''rendang pesisir''. ''Rendang darek'' (\u2018land rendang\u2019) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of Minangkabau such as [[Batusangkar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]], [[Limapuluh Koto Regency|Lima Puluh Kota]], [[Payakumbuh]], [[Padang Panjang]] and [[Bukittinggi]]. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. ''Rendang pesisir'' (\u2018coastal rendang\u2019) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman.

Malaysian rendang has several variants, such as the Kelantanese rendang and the Negri Sembilan rendang. Malaysian styles of rendang are typically cooked for shorter periods and use ''[[kerisik]]'' (toasted grated coconut) to thicken the spice,<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/> instead of stirring over a low heat for many hours to evaporate the coconut milk as Indonesian rendang requires. Nonetheless, in Malaysia, the ''rendang Tok'' variant, found in the state of [[Perak]], is a dry one.\n\nIn the Philippines, rendang is most commonly associated with the cuisine of the Muslim [[Maranao people]] of [[Mindanao]]. It differs from the Indonesian versions in the use of the native spice mix ''[[Palapa (condiment)|palapa]]'' as well as the addition of ''[[muscovado]]'' sugar.<ref name=\"Fenix\">{{cite web |last1=Fenix |first1=Micky |title=Kitchens of Mindanao: Durian custard, \u2018piyaparan a manok,\u2019 Tausug \u2018tiyula\u2019 |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/303843/kitchens-mindanao-durian-custard-piyaparan-manok-tausug-tiyula/ |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Muslim Cuisine and Delicacies in CdeO |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/popular-muslim-cuisine-delicacies-cdeo/ |website=About Cagayan de Oro |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How to Cook Beef Rendang of The Maranao People |url=https://lynsojor.wordpress.com/2019/02/17/how-to-cook-beef-rendang-of-the-maranao-people/ |website=Lyn Sojor |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang \u2013 aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants \u2014 tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes. Through colonial ties the Dutch are also familiar with rendang and often serve the wet ''kalio'' version in the [[Netherlands]] \u2014 usually as part of a ''[[rijsttafel]]''.\n\n==Fusion rendang==\n[[File:7-Eleven Frozen Spaghetti Rendang.JPG|thumb|right|Spaghetti rendang sold in [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, Jakarta.]]\nRendang ''[[bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' is sometimes used as the base of other [[Fusion cuisine|fusion dishes]].

These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularised rendang and other [[Padang food]] dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world.\n\n[[Andalas University]] historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants and migrant workers began to trade and migrate to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] in the 16th century, \"Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for long journey.\"<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/> The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature.<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/>\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Nasi ramas rendang.JPG|thumb|right|''Nasi ramas padang'', rendang served with [[steamed rice]], [[cassava]] leaf, [[egg]] and ''[[gulai]]'' sauce in [[Surabaya]] \u2013 [[Indonesia]].]]\nIn Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: ''[[Gulai]] \u2014 Kalio \u2013 Rendang''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Dian Kelana | title=Gulai, Kalio, atau Rendang? | publisher=Kompasiana | date=17 March 2010 | url=http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | language=Indonesian | accessdate=14 September 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914201307/http://wisata.kompasiana.com/jalan-jalan/2010/03/18/gulai-kalio-atau-rendang-96187.html | archivedate=14 September 2014 }}</ref> The ingredients of ''gulai'', ''kalio'' and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that ''gulai'' usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\n\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called ''gulai''. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called ''kalio''. For a traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the colour turns to a dark brown, almost black colour. Thus not only liquid content but also colour indicate which type of rendang is involved: ''gulai'' is light yellow, ''kalio'' is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\n\n===Dried rendang===\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended and cooked for hours until the coconut milk evaporated and the meat absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honour guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored in room temperature and still good to consume.<ref name=\"William Wongso\" /> It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.\n\n===Wet rendang or ''kalio''===\n[[File:Rendang dish closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Most rendang in the Netherlands is actually a ''kalio'' because it still contains some liquid]]\nWet rendang, more accurately identified as ''kalio'', is a type of rendang that is cooked for a shorter period of time and much of the coconut milk liquid has not evaporated. If stored at room temperature, ''kalio'' lasts less than a week.<ref name=\"Lipoeto2001\"/> Kalio usually has a light golden brown colour, paler than dry rendang.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Rendang hati.JPG|thumb|right|Beef liver rendang]]\nRendang is made from beef (or occasionally [[beef liver]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[mutton]], [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], or vegetables like [[jackfruit]] or [[cassava]]). Chicken or duck rendang also contains [[tamarind]] and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesian Regional Food and Cookery |last=Owen |first=Sri |publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd |year=1999 |isbn=0-7112-1273-2}}</ref>\n\nThe original Indonesian-Minangkabau rendang has two categories, ''rendang darek'' and ''rendang pesisir''. ''Rendang darek'' (\u2018land rendang\u2019) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of Minangkabau such as [[Batusangkar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]], [[Limapuluh Koto Regency|Lima Puluh Kota]], [[Payakumbuh]], [[Padang Panjang]] and [[Bukittinggi]]. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products which are found in these places. ''Rendang pesisir'' (\u2018coastal rendang\u2019) is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as Pariaman, Padang, Painan and Pasaman. ''Rendang pesisir'' mainly consists of seafood, although it is not unusual for them to incorporate beef or water buffalo meat in their rendang.\n\nIndonesian Rendang variations:<ref name=\"urangminang.com\"/>\n# '''Rendang daging''': meat rendang. The most common rendang is made from beef, but may also be from [[water buffalo]], goat, [[mutton]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], speciality of [[Padang]].\n# '''Rendang ayam''': chicken rendang, speciality of Batusangkar and Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang baluik (rendang belut)''': [[eel]] rendang, speciality of [[Solok]]. In the Solok dialect, it is also called \u2018''randang baluk''\u2019.\n# '''Rendang cubadak (rendang nangka)''': jackfruit rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang hati''': cow liver rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang itiak (rendang bebek)''': duck rendang, speciality of Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang jamur''': mushroom rendang\n# '''Rendang jantung pisang''': [[Banana#Flower|banana blossom]] rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang jariang (rendang jengkol)''': ''[[Archidendron pauciflorum|jengkol]]'' rendang, speciality of Bukittinggi.\n# '''Rendang jo kantang''': beef rendang with baby potatoes, speciality of [[Kapau]].\n# '''Rendang lokan (rendang tiram)''': marsh clam rendang, speciality of coastal Minangkabau regions such as [[Pariaman]], [[Painan]] and [[Pesisir Selatan]].\n# '''Rendang paru''': cow's lung rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang pucuak ubi (rendang daun singkong)''': cassava leaf rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang runtiah (rendang suir)''': shredded beef or poultry rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang tahu''': tofu rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang talua (rendang telur)''': egg rendang, speciality of Payakumbuh.\n# '''Rendang tempe''': [[tempeh|''tempe'']] rendang, speciality of Minangkabau.\n# '''Rendang tongkol''': mackerel tuna rendang, speciality of coastal Minangkabau regions.\n\n==In other countries==\nOutside of its native land in Minangkabau, rendang is also known in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, southern Thailand, and the southern [[Philippines]].<ref name=\"rendang origin and popularity\"/><ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Amanda |title=Regional Cuisine of Mindanao |url=https://balay.ph/best-mindanao-cuisine/ |website=Balay.ph |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> Most Malaysian rendang is more like ''kalio'', lighter in colour and taste when compared with its Minangkabau counterpart. Malaysian rendang has several variants, such as the Kelantanese rendang and the Negri Sembilan rendang. Malaysian styles of rendang are typically cooked for shorter periods and use ''[[kerisik]]'' (toasted grated coconut) to thicken the spice,<ref name=\"William Wongso\"/> instead of stirring over a low heat for many hours to evaporate the coconut milk as Indonesian rendang requires. Nonetheless, in Malaysia, the ''rendang Tok'' variant, found in the state of [[Perak]], is a dry one.\n\nIn the Philippines, rendang is most commonly associated with the cuisine of the Muslim [[Maranao people]] of [[Mindanao]]. It differs from the Indonesian versions in the use of the native spice mix ''[[Palapa (condiment)|palapa]]'' as well as the addition of ''[[muscovado]]'' sugar.<ref name=\"Fenix\">{{cite web |last1=Fenix |first1=Micky |title=Kitchens of Mindanao: Durian custard, \u2018piyaparan a manok,\u2019 Tausug \u2018tiyula\u2019 |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/303843/kitchens-mindanao-durian-custard-piyaparan-manok-tausug-tiyula/ |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Muslim Cuisine and Delicacies in CdeO |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/popular-muslim-cuisine-delicacies-cdeo/ |website=About Cagayan de Oro |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How to Cook Beef Rendang of The Maranao People |url=https://lynsojor.wordpress.com/2019/02/17/how-to-cook-beef-rendang-of-the-maranao-people/ |website=Lyn Sojor |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang \u2013 aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants \u2014 tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes. Through colonial ties the Dutch are also familiar with rendang and often serve the wet ''kalio'' version in the [[Netherlands]] \u2014 usually as part of a ''[[rijsttafel]]''.\n\n==Fusion rendang==\n[[File:7-Eleven Frozen Spaghetti Rendang.JPG|thumb|right|Spaghetti rendang sold in [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, Jakarta.]]\nRendang ''[[bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' is sometimes used as the base of other [[Fusion cuisine|fusion dishes]]. Some chefs in Indonesian [[sushi]] establishments for example, have developed a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine with recipes for krakatau roll, [[gado-gado]] roll, rendang roll and [[gulai]] ramen.<ref name=\"Suntiang\">{{cite web | title=New: Suntiang, When Padang Marries Japanese Food | url=http://www.culinarybonanza.com/2014/02/suntiang-the-first-padang-japanese-fusion-restaurant.html | date=6 February 2014 |publisher=Culinary Bonanza| accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> Several chefs and food industries have experimented with fusing rendang with [[sandwich]]es, [[Hamburger|burger]]s and [[spaghetti]].

As in the classic CAN, CAN FD protocol is designed to reliably transmit and receive sensor data, control commands and to detect data errors between electronic sensor devices, controllers and [[microcontroller]]s. Although CAN FD was primarily designed for use in high performance vehicle ECUs (Electronic Control Units) however, the pervasiveness of classic CAN in the different industries will lead into  inclusion of this improved protocol in a variety of other applications as well, such as in electronic systems used in robotics, defense, industrial automation, underwater vehicles, medical equipment, avionics, Down-hole drilling sensors, etc.\n\n== CAN FD versus classic CAN ==\nThe primary difference between the classical CAN (Controller Area Network) and CAN FD is the Flexible Data (FD). Using CAN FD, Electronic Control Unit (ECU)s can dynamically switch  to different data-rate and with larger or smaller message sizes. Enhanced features in CAN FD includes the capability to dynamically select and switch to faster or slower data rate, as and when required, and to pack more data within the same CAN frame / message and transport it over the CAN BUS / network in less time. Faster data speed and more data capacity enhancements results in several system operational advantages compared to the classic CAN. Using CAN FD, sensor and control data can be sent and received by the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) software much quicker. Commands issued by the executing ECU software reaches the output controller must faster. CAN FD is typically used in high performance ECUs of modern vehicles.  A modern vehicle can have more than 70 ECUs that use CAN FD to exchange information over the CAN Bus when the engine is running or when the vehicle is moving.\n\nIn CAN FD, the frame/message ID has been increased to 29-bits compared to only 11-bits in the classic CAN. The message payload size has been increased to 64 bytes of data in each CAN-frame / message,  compared to only 8-bytes in the classic CAN frame. CAN FD can handle CAN frames/messages with 11-bit ID as well. A frame is a message transmitted as a sequence of binary bit-pattern. In CAN FD, the data rate (i.e. number of bits transmitted per second) is increased to be 5 times faster than the classic CAN. CAN FD protocol specification includes some other enhancements as well, such as better detection of errors in the received CAN message and the executing software flexibility to dynamically select (from a list) and switch to faster or slower data rate transfer, as and when required. Some sensors on the CAN BUS operates at slower data rate and others at faster data rate. CAN BUS is a shared pair of wires onto which electronic sensors, controller units and ECUs are connected. CAN Bus is used for exchanging information between operational units periodically or on demand. The electrical condition and configuration of the CAN Bus, i.e. the total number of units connected, the length of the CAN Bus wires and other electro-magnetic factors determines the fastest data transfer rate possible on that CAN Bus. This because when units are connected to a CAN Bus (e.g, a Sensors, a Controllers, or ECUs), it changes the electrical condition of the CAN Bus somewhat. The change may result in limiting the CAN FD protocol from achieving the maximum theoretical data transfer rate. \n\nCAN-FD Busload that was developed by \"De Andrade's\" equation based on Tindel's equation.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Andrade |first1=R. |last2=Hodel |first2=K.

They are (i) Bit Monitoring, (ii) Bit Stuffing, (iii) Frame Check, (iv) Acknowledgement Check and (v) Cyclic Redundancy Check. There are two options of CRC which should be denoted as  for CRC length of 17 bits or  for CRC length of 21 bits. \n  \n                  \nTs = ([(SOF+ID+r1+IDE+EDL+r0+BRS/2+CRCdel/2)* 1,2]+ACK+DEL+EOF+IFS)/t_x   (3)\nTf = (\u3016[(D\u3017_f+BRS/2+ESI+DLC+CRCdel/2)*1,2]+\u3016CRC\u3017_17+5)/t_y     (4)\n\nwhere SOF (Start of Frame) + ID ( Identifier) + r1 (reserved bit 1) + IDE + EDL( Extended Data Length) + r0(reserved bit 0) + BRS/2 (Bit Rate Switch) + CRCdel/2 (CRC delimiter)= 17 bits, 1.2 is the factor of the worst case bit stuffing, which means it is necessary to divide by 5. It is considered BRS and CRCdel divided by 2, because they are exactly in the shift of bit rate transition. The ACK (Acknowledge) + DEL (Delimiter) + EOF (End-of-Frame) + IFS (Interframe Spacing) = 12 bits without bit stuffing.

United States. According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the population of the city is 129,775 as of July 1, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/stamfordcityconnecticut|title=census.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As of 2017, according to the Census Bureau, the population of Stamford had risen to 131,000, making it the third-largest city in the state (behind [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]) and the [[New England#Demographics|seventh-largest city in New England]]. Approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off|sp=us}} from [[Manhattan]], Stamford is in the [[Greater Bridgeport|Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury Metro area]] which is a part of the Greater [[New York metropolitan area]].\n\nStamford is home to eight [[Fortune 500]] companies as of 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford&hqstate=CT|title=Fortune500|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford|title=Fortune 500|date=29 March 2019|work=Fortune}}</ref> as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives Stamford the largest [[financial centre|financial district]] in the New York metropolitan region outside New York City itself and one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Stamford, Connecticut}}\nStamford was known as Rippowam by the [[Siwanoy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants to the region, and the very first [[Europe]]an settlers to the area also referred to it as such. The present name is after the town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA334|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=334}}</ref> The [[deed]] to Stamford was signed on July 1, 1640, between Captain Turner of the [[New Haven Colony]] and Chief Ponus. By the 18th century, one of the primary industries of the town was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford's proximity to New York.\n[[File:Stamford Aerial 2017.png|thumb|250x250px|Downtown and South End neighborhoods of Stamford. Long Island is in the distance.]]\n\nIn 1692, Stamford was home to a less famous [[witch trial]] than the well-known [[Salem witch trials]], which also occurred in 1692. The accusations were less fanatical and on a smaller scale, but they also grew to prominence through gossip and hysterics.<ref name=\"singular\">{{Cite book|last=Godbeer|first=Richard|title=Escaping Salem|date=January 2005|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516130-0| chapter=Chapter 1: Katherine Branch's Fits}}</ref>\n\n[[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] officially separated from Stamford when it incorporated as a town in 1801, followed by [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in 1820.\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, New York residents built summer homes on the shoreline, and even back then there were some who moved to Stamford permanently and started commuting to Manhattan by train, although the practice became more popular later. Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.\n\nIn 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.268</ref> A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Company was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown in an ongoing redevelopment project that was contentious, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many of the other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story [[Trump Parc Stamford]] condominium tower, and then again by the Atlantic Station development, another project by the Rich Company in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|title=Commercial Property /Stamford, Conn.; A Pioneer Business Park That Confounded Critics|first=Eleanor|last=Charles|date=September 26, 1999|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued, with breaks during downturns in the economy, through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.\n\nSince 2008, an 80-acre mixed-use redevelopment project for the Stamford's [[Harbor Point, Stamford|Harbor Point]] neighborhood has added additional growth south of the city's [[Downtown Stamford|Downtown]] area. Once complete, the redevelopment will include 6,000,000 square feet (560,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of new residential, retail, office and hotel space, and a marina. As of July 2012, roughly 900 of the projected 4,000 Harbor Point residential units had been constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trending-Why-one-city-is-booming-4540657.php|title=Trending: Why one city is booming|work=Connecticut Post|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>\nNew restaurants and recreational activities have come up in the Harbor Point area, which is considered as New Stamford.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Stamford CT night aerial from the west.jpg|thumb|right|Stamford at night from the west, with [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] beyond. [[Long Island Sound]] is completely dark.]]\n\n  \nStamford is situated near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on [[Long Island Sound]]. It consists of several neighborhoods and villages including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn Of River, Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury and Palmers Hill. North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the City of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the North, the Long Island Sound to the South, Greenwich, Connecticut to the West, Darien to the East, and New Canaan to the Northeast.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|52.09|sqmi|km2}}, making it the largest city by area in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stamford Master Plan |url=https://www.stamfordct.gov/sites/stamfordct/files/u358/final_draft_12.16.14_0.pdf |website=stamfordct.gov |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''),  with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Stamford, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.\n\nThe warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Stamford. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.\n\nAlthough infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nStamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. Stamford averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford\u2014averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stamford, Connecticut\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  69\n|Feb record high F =  74\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record

Although providing a public education is a state responsibility, Connecticut ranks near the bottom in state share of public education expenditures. Thus, the majority of education funding must come from local governments like that of Stamford. According to the State Department of Education, in the 2004\u201305 academic year, 42.7% of Stamford's public school students were economically disadvantaged, 34.8% did not have English as a home language and 11.6% were students with disabilities. Research has shown that these populations need additional resources to meet state academic standards. Owing to the state school finance system, the burden of these extra necessary costs of education falls primarily on Stamford's local government. The public school system is an integrated district with racial balance requirements exceeding those of the state of Connecticut. State standards require that a school's racial makeup be within 25% of the community's racial makeup. Stamford's standard is a more strict 10%. Over the years, schools have become unbalanced.\n\nStamford has three public [[high school]]s: [[Westhill High School (Connecticut)|Westhill High School]], [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]], and the [[Academy of Information Technology and Engineering]]. The city also has several private schools, including [[Trinity Catholic High School (Connecticut)|Trinity Catholic High School]], Villa Maria School, and Bi-Cultural Jewish Day School, [[King Low Heywood Thomas]], and The Long Ridge School as well as one state charter school: Stamford Academy Charter High School, which is closing in June 2020 which is operated by Domus <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stamfordacademy.org|title=Welcome to Stamford Academy|website=Stamfordacademy.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.domuskids.org/|title=Domus|website=Domuskids.org|accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Libraries==\nStamford's [[public library]], the [[Ferguson Library]], is one of the largest in Connecticut.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the population of the city is 129,775 as of July 1, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/stamfordcityconnecticut|title=census.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As of 2017, according to the Census Bureau, the population of Stamford had risen to 131,000, making it the third-largest city in the state (behind [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]) and the [[New England#Demographics|seventh-largest city in New England]]. Approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off|sp=us}} from [[Manhattan]], Stamford is in the [[Greater Bridgeport|Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury Metro area]] which is a part of the Greater [[New York metropolitan area]].\n\nStamford is home to eight [[Fortune 500]] companies as of 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford&hqstate=CT|title=Fortune500|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford|title=Fortune 500|date=29 March 2019|work=Fortune}}</ref> as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives Stamford the largest [[financial centre|financial district]] in the New York metropolitan region outside New York City itself and one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Stamford, Connecticut}}\nStamford was known as Rippowam by the [[Siwanoy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants to the region, and the very first [[Europe]]an settlers to the area also referred to it as such. The present name is after the town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA334|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=334}}</ref> The [[deed]] to Stamford was signed on July 1, 1640, between Captain Turner of the [[New Haven Colony]] and Chief Ponus. By the 18th century, one of the primary industries of the town was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford's proximity to New York.\n[[File:Stamford Aerial 2017.png|thumb|250x250px|Downtown and South End neighborhoods of Stamford. Long Island is in the distance.]]\n\nIn 1692, Stamford was home to a less famous [[witch trial]] than the well-known [[Salem witch trials]], which also occurred in 1692. The accusations were less fanatical and on a smaller scale, but they also grew to prominence through gossip and hysterics.<ref name=\"singular\">{{Cite book|last=Godbeer|first=Richard|title=Escaping Salem|date=January 2005|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516130-0| chapter=Chapter 1: Katherine Branch's Fits}}</ref>\n\n[[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] officially separated from Stamford when it incorporated as a town in 1801, followed by [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in 1820.\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, New York residents built summer homes on the shoreline, and even back then there were some who moved to Stamford permanently and started commuting to Manhattan by train, although the practice became more popular later. Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.\n\nIn 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.268</ref> A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Company was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown in an ongoing redevelopment project that was contentious, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many of the other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story [[Trump Parc Stamford]] condominium tower, and then again by the Atlantic Station development, another project by the Rich Company in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|title=Commercial Property /Stamford, Conn.; A Pioneer Business Park That Confounded Critics|first=Eleanor|last=Charles|date=September 26, 1999|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued, with breaks during downturns in the economy, through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.\n\nSince 2008, an 80-acre mixed-use redevelopment project for the Stamford's [[Harbor Point, Stamford|Harbor Point]] neighborhood has added additional growth south of the city's [[Downtown Stamford|Downtown]] area. Once complete, the redevelopment will include 6,000,000 square feet (560,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of new residential, retail, office and hotel space, and a marina. As of July 2012, roughly 900 of the projected 4,000 Harbor Point residential units had been constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trending-Why-one-city-is-booming-4540657.php|title=Trending: Why one city is booming|work=Connecticut Post|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>\nNew restaurants and recreational activities have come up in the Harbor Point area, which is considered as New Stamford.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Stamford CT night aerial from the west.jpg|thumb|right|Stamford at night from the west, with [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] beyond. [[Long Island Sound]] is completely dark.]]\n\n  \nStamford is situated near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on [[Long Island Sound]]. It consists of several neighborhoods and villages including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn Of River, Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury and Palmers Hill. North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the City of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the North, the Long Island Sound to the South, Greenwich, Connecticut to the West, Darien to the East, and New Canaan to the Northeast.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|52.09|sqmi|km2}}, making it the largest city by area in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stamford Master Plan |url=https://www.stamfordct.gov/sites/stamfordct/files/u358/final_draft_12.16.14_0.pdf |website=stamfordct.gov |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''),  with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Stamford, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.\n\nThe warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Stamford. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.\n\nAlthough infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nStamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. Stamford averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford\u2014averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stamford, Connecticut\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  69\n|Feb record high F =  74\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record

Although providing a public education is a state responsibility, Connecticut ranks near the bottom in state share of public education expenditures. Thus, the majority of education funding must come from local governments like that of Stamford. According to the State Department of Education, in the 2004\u201305 academic year, 42.7% of Stamford's public school students were economically disadvantaged, 34.8% did not have English as a home language and 11.6% were students with disabilities. Research has shown that these populations need additional resources to meet state academic standards. Owing to the state school finance system, the burden of these extra necessary costs of education falls primarily on Stamford's local government. The public school system is an integrated district with racial balance requirements exceeding those of the state of Connecticut. State standards require that a school's racial makeup be within 25% of the community's racial makeup. Stamford's standard is a more strict 10%. Over the years, schools have become unbalanced.\n\nStamford has three public [[high school]]s: [[Westhill High School (Connecticut)|Westhill High School]], [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]], and the [[Academy of Information Technology and Engineering]]. The city also has several private schools, including [[Trinity Catholic High School (Connecticut)|Trinity Catholic High School]], Villa Maria School, and Bi-Cultural Jewish Day School, [[King Low Heywood Thomas]], and The Long Ridge School as well as one state charter school: Stamford Academy Charter High School, which is closing in June 2020 which is operated by Domus <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stamfordacademy.org|title=Welcome to Stamford Academy|website=Stamfordacademy.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.domuskids.org/|title=Domus|website=Domuskids.org|accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Libraries==\nStamford's [[public library]], the [[Ferguson Library]], is one of the largest in Connecticut.
