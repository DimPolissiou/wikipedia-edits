The two most notable of them are:\n* ''[[Walesa.

It shows Wa\u0142\u0119sa's change from a shipyard worker into a charismatic labor leader. The film was shot in the historical locations of the depicted events, including the former Lenin Shipyard. It won three awards, including ''Silver Hugo'' for Robert Wi\u0119ckiewicz at [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and a ''Pasinetti Award'' for [[Maria Rosaria Omaggio]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], and was nominated for five more awards.<ref>{{IMDb title|2113820|Walesa.

Tomczyk is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who appears as himself in the movie. The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981. Waida was awarded both the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' and the ''[[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]]'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for the film.

The two most notable of them are:\n* ''[[Walesa.

It shows Wa\u0142\u0119sa's change from a shipyard worker into a charismatic labor leader. The film was shot in the historical locations of the depicted events, including the former Lenin Shipyard. It won three awards, including ''Silver Hugo'' for Robert Wi\u0119ckiewicz at [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and a ''Pasinetti Award'' for [[Maria Rosaria Omaggio]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], and was nominated for five more awards.<ref>{{IMDb title|2113820|Walesa.

The main character, a young worker Maciej Tomczyk ([[Jerzy Radziwi\u0142owicz]]) is involved in the anti-Communist labor movement. Tomczyk is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who appears as himself in the movie. The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981. Waida was awarded both the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' and the ''[[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]]'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for the film.
