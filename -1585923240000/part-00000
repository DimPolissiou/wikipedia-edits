It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\". On 24 January 2019, the song was released for the film ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019), and was met with moderate commercial success. In the same month, Lipa stated that she had been spending the past year in the writing process for an upcoming second studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-grammys-music-2019-779203/|title=Dua Lipa's New Rules for 2019|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=16 January 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the sound of the album, Lipa commented that it would be a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class\".<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48880735|title=Dua Lipa reveals nerves about new album|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=5 July 2019|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> On the development of ''Future Nostalgia'', Lipa stated:\n<blockquote>\nWhat I wanted to do with this album was to break out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to make music that felt like it could sit alongside some of my favourite classic pop songs, whilst still feeling fresh and uniquely mine.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\". On 24 January 2019, the song was released for the film ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019), and was met with moderate commercial success. In the same month, Lipa stated that she had been spending the past year in the writing process for an upcoming second studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-grammys-music-2019-779203/|title=Dua Lipa's New Rules for 2019|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=16 January 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the sound of the album, Lipa commented that it would be a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class\".<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48880735|title=Dua Lipa reveals nerves about new album|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=5 July 2019|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> On the development of ''Future Nostalgia'', Lipa stated:\n<blockquote>\nWhat I wanted to do with this album was to break out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to make music that felt like it could sit alongside some of my favourite classic pop songs, whilst still feeling fresh and uniquely mine.

{"title_page": "Gee-H (navigation)", "text_new": "'''Gee-H''', sometimes written '''G-H''' or '''GEE-H''', was a [[radio navigation]] system developed by [[Great Britain|Britain]] during [[World War II]] to aid [[RAF Bomber Command]]. The name refers to the system's use of the earlier [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] equipment, as well as its use of the \"H principle\" or \"twin-range principle\" of location determination.{{sfn|Turner & Roberts|p=16}} Its official name was [[Air Ministry Experimental Station|AMES Type 100]].\n\nGee-H was used to supplant the [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] bombing system which worked along similar lines. By measuring and keeping a fixed distance to a radio station, the [[bomber]] could navigate along an arc in the sky. The bombs were dropped when they reached a set distance from a second station. The main difference between Oboe and Gee-H was the location of the equipment; Oboe used very large displays in ground stations to take very accurate measurements but could only direct one aircraft at a time. Gee-H used much smaller gear on board the aircraft and was somewhat less accurate but could direct as many as 80 aircraft at a time.\n\nGee-H entered service in October 1943 and first used successfully in November against the [[Mannesmann]] steel works at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on the night of 1/2 November, when about half of the sets failed leaving only 15 aircraft to bomb the factory. Gee-H remained in use throughout the war, although it was subject to considerable jamming from the Germans. It also remained a standard fixture of post-war RAF aircraft like the [[English Electric Canberra]].\n\nGee-H was adapted by [[RCA]] into the US wartime [[SHORAN]] system with improved accuracy. The same basic concept remains in widespread use today as the civilian [[Distance measuring equipment|DME]] system.\n\n==Development history==\n\n===Distance measuring navigation===\nDetermining your location in 2D space requires two measurements of angle or range - two angle measurements, two distance measurements, or one angle and one distance. Early radio navigation was typically based on taking two angle measurements using [[radio direction finder]]s, but these were accurate only to a few degrees and provided limited accuracy on the order of tens of miles. The development of range-based systems had to wait until the invention of accurate time measurement of radio signals were possible, which came about as a result of the development of [[radar]].{{sfn|Proc|2001}}\n\nThe [[Luftwaffe]] pioneered the use of distance-measuring radio navigation systems with their [[Y-Ger\u00e4t (navigation)|Y-Ger\u00e4t]] system in 1941. Y-Ger\u00e4t used a single [[Knickebein]]-like beam for steering the bomber in the proper direction, and an onboard [[transponder]] for distance measurements. A special signal was periodically sent from a ground station, and on reception, the transponder would send out an answering pulse after a known delay. A ground operator used an [[oscilloscope]] to measure the time between broadcast and reception and deduced the range in a fashion similar to conventional [[radar]] systems. He then radioed this information to the bomber by voice, telling them when to release their bombs.<ref>Greg Goebel, [http://www.vectorsite.net/ttwiz_07.html#m3 \"Battle of the Beams: Y-GERAET\"], ''The Wizard War: WW2 & The Origins Of Radar '', 1 March 2011</ref>\n\nThe downside to the beam-type system of navigation is that the beams cannot be focused perfectly and in practice are fan-shaped, growing wider with increasing distance from the broadcaster. This means they have decreasing accuracy with increasing range.{{sfn|Brown|1999|p=288}} Measurements of distance are dependent only on the accuracy of the equipment, and are independent of range. This means their accuracy is a fixed percentage of the measurement, and so is linear with range. It is possible to use two such measurements to provide a location ''fix'', but such systems are generally difficult to use, as they require two range measurements to be made in quick succession, while the aircraft is moving.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=250}}\n\n===Oboe===\nThe [[Air Ministry]] developed a distance-measuring system known as [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] which first started reaching the [[Pathfinder Force]] in late 1941 and was used experimentally in 1942. Oboe avoided the problems with two distance measurements by using only one at a time.\n\nBefore the mission, the distance from one of the Oboe stations to the target was measured, and an arc of that radius drawn on a conventional navigation chart. For instance, the distance between the Oboe station near [[Walmer]] and a target in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] would be about {{convert|235|miles}}, so an arc with a 235&nbsp;mile radius around the station would be drawn, passing through D\u00fcsseldorf.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}} Now the \"range\" of the bombs being dropped would be calculated. Range is the distance between the point where the bombs are released and the point where they impact. For missions around 20,000&nbsp;ft altitude, range is typically on the order of {{convert|1.5|miles}} for a high-speed aircraft like the [[de Havilland Mosquito]]. The mission planners would then calculate the location along that arc where the bombs would need to be dropped to hit the target. This calculation, carried out on the ground, could be as time-consuming as required, allowing the consideration of winds, atmospheric pressure, even the tiny centrifugal force generated by the aircraft following the 235&nbsp;mile radius curve.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}}\n\nDuring the mission, the bomber would fly itself close to one end of the arc or the other, using any means of navigation including [[dead reckoning]]. When they were near the pre-arranged location, the transponder was activated, and the Oboe station would measure their current distance. This \"cat\" station would then send out a voice-frequency radio signal of either dots or dashes, allowing the pilot to adjust their path so they were at precisely the right range, at which point they would send out a steady tone, the \"equisignal\".{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}} Operators would continue to watch the position of the aircraft, sending out correcting signals as needed so the pilot could continue to adjust their path along the arc.\n\nMeanwhile, a second station was also measuring the distance to the bomber. This station was equipped with the bomb's range value calculated earlier, and had used this to calculate the distance between their station and the bomber at the point where the bombs needed to be dropped. When this ''mouse'' station saw the bomber approaching the drop point, it sent a series of [[Morse code]] signals to inform the pilot that the drop point was approaching. At the precise instant, it would send another morse signal that would drop the bombs automatically.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}}\n\nThe main constraint of Oboe was that it could only be used by one aircraft at a time. As it took about 10 minutes for the bomber to get itself properly positioned along the arc, this delay meant that the system could not be used for a large raid with multiple aircraft in succession. Instead, Oboe was used to guide the [[target marker|target marking]] aircraft of the pathfinder force, giving the main force of bombers an accurate aiming point in any weather. Alternately, Oboe was sometimes used for attacks on point targets by single aircraft, or a small number dropping one after the other. In tests, Oboe demonstrated accuracies greater than those of optical bombsights during daylight in good weather.{{sfn|Brown|1999|p=302}}\n\n===A new approach===\nOboe was limited to one aircraft because the onboard transponder would send pulses every time the ground stations queried them. If more than one aircraft turned on their Oboe, the ground stations would start to receive several return pulses for every query, with no way to distinguish between them.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to have each Oboe station send out a slightly different signal, normally by changing the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the signal it broadcasts to the aircraft. Similar stations with different signal modifications can be situated around the UK, so that all of them are visible to an aircraft over Germany. An aircraft that turns on its transponder will receive and re-transmit signals from all of them. Although all of the ground stations will receive all of the signals, they can pick out their own by looking for their unique signal. This change allows many Oboe stations to be operational at the same time, although it does not help the situation if more than one aircraft turns on their transponder.\n\nNow consider reversing the location of the [[Transmitter|transmitters]] and [[radio receiver|receivers]], so that the receiver is on the aircraft and the transmitter on the ground. Now every aircraft generates a different signal pattern, and the operators on the aircraft can look for their own signal and ignore the others. Any number of aircraft can use the same station at the same time. As long as the ground station is equipped to quickly turn the signals around and the aircraft do not query too often, the chance of more than one aircraft querying the station at the very same time is low. This is the basic concept behind Gee-H.<ref>Hubregt Visser, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qv9luhVAKAQC&pg=PA65 \"Array and Phased Array Antenna Basics\"], John Wiley and Sons, 2006, p. 65</ref>\n\n===Gee-H===\n[[File:Avro Lancaster - Waddington - Aircraft of the Royal Air Force in the Second World War 1939-1945 MH6448.jpg|thumb|right|<center>G-H Leader [[Avro Lancaster|Avro Lancaster B Mark III]] of [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF]] as it begins its take-off run at [[RAF Waddington]], August 1944</center>]]\nThe first radio navigation system to be operated by Bomber Command was [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]]. This operated by sending out two pulses of known timing from ground stations which were picked up by the aircraft and read on an [[oscilloscope]]. The timing between transmissions was not fixed and varied from station to station, so the equipment in the bomber had a system that allowed it to adjust for this.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=249}}\n\nThe receiver had a local oscillator that provided a [[time base generator]] that could be adjusted. When the receiver was first turned on, the pulses from the ground station would move across the display because the two time bases were not synchronized. The operator then tuned their oscillator until the pulses stopped moving, which meant that the local oscillator was now at precisely the same pulse frequency as that in the ground station. The receiver had two complete systems of this type, allowing the operator to receive signals from two stations and easily compare them and make simultaneous measurements.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=249}}\n\nIn order rapidly to deploy the new design, it was decided to re-use as much of the Gee equipment as possible. Gee already included the oscilloscope display and the receiver unit, so all that was needed was a broadcaster unit that would trigger the ground station transceiver. This was designed to operate on the same frequencies as Gee, so that the existing receiver and display equipment in the bombers could be used.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=250}}\n\nThe new transmitter sent out pulses about 100 times a second. The timing of the pulses was slightly advanced or retarded from exactly 100 per second. This meant that every aircraft had a slightly different timing. The same signal was also sent to the Gee display unit to start the display beam moving across the face of the display, instead of using Gee's manually tuned oscillator. This way, the received signals that did not have the same inter-pulse timing would appear to move one way or the other, exactly like a mistuned Gee. Only the signals originating from the aircraft's own transmitter would line up on the display and remain motionless. This deliberate adjustment of the timing was known as \"jittering\".{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=250}}\n\nThe delay from the original Gee was still used, but re-purposed. In operation, the navigator would first set the delay of the upper trace on the Gee display to a known figure that matched the radius of the arc they wanted to fly along. This would move the \"blip\" from the local transmitter along the face of the display. Received signals would then be inverted and sent to the display. The navigator could then direct the pilot onto the right path by giving directions until the upper and lower blips aligned. The same was done for the second channel, setting it to the pre-computed range where the bombs should be dropped. Since they stayed the same distance from one station the operator only had to check that periodically, while watching the ever-moving lower trace as the active blip moved slowly along the display towards the timer blip until they overlapped and the bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=251}}\n\nThe time taken by the transceiver to receive a pulse, send out the response and return to the receiving condition was about 100&nbsp;microseconds. With a pulse timing of about 100 a second, a transceiver would be busy for 10&nbsp;ms out of every second responding to the signals from any one aircraft. This would leave 990&nbsp;ms free to respond to other aircraft, giving a theoretical capacity of 100 aircraft. In practice, due to the \"jitter\", about 70 to 80 aircraft could use a station at a time.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=251}}\n\nThe system had the additional advantage that each aircraft selected its timing, which made jamming more difficult. With most pulsed navigation systems like Gee and Y-Ger\u00e4t, it is relatively easy to jam the system simply by sending out additional pulses on the same frequency, cluttering up the display and making it very difficult for the operator to read the signal. The British had used this technique to great effect against Y-Ger\u00e4t, and the Germans returned the favour against Gee. By the late war period, Gee was generally useless for bombing, and used primarily as a navigational aid when returning to England.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=252}}\n\nIn the case of Gee-H, each aircraft had unique timing. In order to jam the receiver, the jammer would also have to have similar timing. But as a single signal might be used by dozens of aircraft, dozens of jammers set to slightly different times would be needed. And as there were dozens of transceivers as well, many unused decoy signals, the magnitude of the jamming problem was considerably more difficult. As the Gee-H system used Gee equipment, turning off the interrogation transmitter turned it back into a normal Gee unit. On a typical mission, the set would be used in Gee mode while leaving England and forming up into a [[bomber stream]], in Gee-H mode during the mission, and then returned to Gee mode again on the return. Since Gee could be directly read on a map, it was extremely useful for general navigation, while Gee-H was primarily useful to navigate to a single location.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=252}}\n\nGee-H's main fault was also a side-effect of the use of Gee equipment; using a higher frequency would allow a tighter envelope, which would allow more accurate timing measurements and thus improve accuracy. Additionally, because the system used Gee's small bomber-borne oscilloscope for measurements, it did not have the same visual accuracy as Oboe, which used 12-inch oscilloscopes developed for specifically for this purpose. Gee-H achieved accuracy of about 150&nbsp;yards at 300&nbsp;miles,{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=250}} while Oboe was good to about three times that. As with all VHF and UHF-based systems, Gee-H was limited to distances just out of [[Sightline|line of sight]], in this case limiting it to about 300&nbsp;miles.\n\nGee-H was key to [[Operation Glimmer]], a diversionary \"attack\" during [[Operation Overlord]] that distracted and pinned-down German defences at Calais while the real invasion fleet was 200 miles away at Normandy. Gee-H-equipped bombers of [[No. 218 Squadron RAF|218 Squadron]] flew low, in tight circles, dropping [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|\"Window\" (chaff)]] over radar transponder-equipped small ships, in order to deceive the German radars that they were the main invasion fleet.<ref>Freeman Dyson, [http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/17847/page3/ \"A Failure of Intelligence\"] Bomber Command OR</ref>\n\n==Air Ministry designations==\n*Gee-H Mk.

The name refers to the system's use of the earlier [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] equipment, as well as its use of the \"H principle\" or \"twin-range principle\" of location determination.{{sfn|Turner & Roberts|p=16}} Its official name was [[Air Ministry Experimental Station|AMES Type 100]].\n\nGee-H was used to supplant the [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] bombing system which worked along similar lines. By measuring and keeping a fixed distance to a radio station, the [[bomber]] could navigate along an arc in the sky. The bombs were dropped when they reached a set distance from a second station. The main difference between Oboe and Gee-H was the location of the equipment; Oboe used very large displays in ground stations to take very accurate measurements but could only direct one aircraft at a time. Gee-H used much smaller gear on board the aircraft and was somewhat less accurate but could direct as many as 80 aircraft at a time.\n\nGee-H entered service in October 1943 and first used successfully in November against the [[Mannesmann]] steel works at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on the night of 1/2 November, when about half of the sets failed leaving only 15 aircraft to bomb the factory. Gee-H remained in use throughout the war, although it was subject to considerable jamming from the Germans. It also remained a standard fixture of post-war RAF aircraft like the [[English Electric Canberra]].\n\nGee-H was adapted by [[RCA]] into the US wartime [[SHORAN]] system with improved accuracy. The same basic concept remains in widespread use today as the civilian [[Distance measuring equipment|DME]] system.\n\n==Development history==\n\n===Distance measuring navigation===\nDetermining your location in 2D space requires two measurements of angle or range - two angle measurements, two distance measurements, or one angle and one distance. Early radio navigation was typically based on taking two angle measurements using [[radio direction finder]]s, but these were accurate only to a few degrees and provided limited accuracy on the order of tens of miles. The development of range-based systems had to wait until the invention of accurate time measurement of radio signals were possible, which came about as a result of the development of [[radar]].{{sfn|Proc|2001}}\n\nThe [[Luftwaffe]] pioneered the use of distance-measuring radio navigation systems with their [[Y-Ger\u00e4t (navigation)|Y-Ger\u00e4t]] system in 1941. Y-Ger\u00e4t used a single [[Knickebein]]-like beam for steering the bomber in the proper direction, and an onboard [[transponder]] for distance measurements. A special signal was periodically sent from a ground station, and on reception, the transponder would send out an answering pulse after a known delay. A ground operator used an [[oscilloscope]] to measure the time between broadcast and reception and deduced the range in a fashion similar to conventional [[radar]] systems. He then radioed this information to the bomber by voice, telling them when to release their bombs.<ref>Greg Goebel, [http://www.vectorsite.net/ttwiz_07.html#m3 \"Battle of the Beams: Y-GERAET\"], ''The Wizard War: WW2 & The Origins Of Radar '', 1 March 2011</ref>\n\nThe downside to the beam-type system of navigation is that the beams cannot be focused perfectly and in practice are fan-shaped, growing wider with increasing distance from the broadcaster. This means they have decreasing accuracy with increasing range.{{sfn|Brown|1999|p=288}} Measurements of distance are dependent only on the accuracy of the equipment, and are independent of range. This means their accuracy is a fixed percentage of the measurement, and so is linear with range. It is possible to use two such measurements to provide a location ''fix'', but such systems are generally difficult to use, as they require two range measurements to be made in quick succession, while the aircraft is moving.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=250}}\n\n===Oboe===\nThe [[Air Ministry]] developed a distance-measuring system known as [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] which first started reaching the [[Pathfinder Force]] in late 1941 and was used experimentally in 1942. Oboe avoided the problems with two distance measurements by using only one at a time.\n\nBefore the mission, the distance from one of the Oboe stations to the target was measured, and an arc of that radius drawn on a conventional navigation chart. For instance, the distance between the Oboe station near [[Walmer]] and a target in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] would be about {{convert|235|miles}}, so an arc with a 235&nbsp;mile radius around the station would be drawn, passing through D\u00fcsseldorf.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}} Now the \"range\" of the bombs being dropped would be calculated. Range is the distance between the point where the bombs are released and the point where they impact. For missions around 20,000&nbsp;ft altitude, range is typically on the order of {{convert|1.5|miles}} for a high-speed aircraft like the [[de Havilland Mosquito]]. The mission planners would then calculate the location along that arc where the bombs would need to be dropped to hit the target. This calculation, carried out on the ground, could be as time-consuming as required, allowing the consideration of winds, atmospheric pressure, even the tiny centrifugal force generated by the aircraft following the 235&nbsp;mile radius curve.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}}\n\nDuring the mission, the bomber would fly itself close to one end of the arc or the other, using any means of navigation including [[dead reckoning]]. When they were near the pre-arranged location, the transponder was activated, and the Oboe station would measure their current distance. This \"cat\" station would then send out a voice-frequency radio signal of either dots or dashes, allowing the pilot to adjust their path so they were at precisely the right range, at which point they would send out a steady tone, the \"equisignal\".{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}} Operators would continue to watch the position of the aircraft, sending out correcting signals as needed so the pilot could continue to adjust their path along the arc.\n\nMeanwhile, a second station was also measuring the distance to the bomber. This station was equipped with the bomb's range value calculated earlier, and had used this to calculate the distance between their station and the bomber at the point where the bombs needed to be dropped. When this ''mouse'' station saw the bomber approaching the drop point, it sent a series of [[Morse code]] signals to inform the pilot that the drop point was approaching. At the precise instant, it would send another morse signal that would drop the bombs automatically.{{sfn|Haigh|1960|p=257}}\n\nThe main constraint of Oboe was that it could only be used by one aircraft at a time. As it took about 10 minutes for the bomber to get itself properly positioned along the arc, this delay meant that the system could not be used for a large raid with multiple aircraft in succession. Instead, Oboe was used to guide the [[target marker|target marking]] aircraft of the pathfinder force, giving the main force of bombers an accurate aiming point in any weather. Alternately, Oboe was sometimes used for attacks on point targets by single aircraft, or a small number dropping one after the other. In tests, Oboe demonstrated accuracies greater than those of optical bombsights during daylight in good weather.{{sfn|Brown|1999|p=302}}\n\n===A new approach===\nOboe was limited to one aircraft because the onboard transponder would send pulses every time the ground stations queried them.

The Taif agreement enshrines a sect-based political system, where political authority is allocated based on the religious affiliation of the public servant.

It is the continental portion of the province and constitutes  71% of the province's area but is home to only 6% of the province's population. It is separated from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Strait of Belle Isle]]. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nLabrador occupies most of the eastern part of the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]].\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern [[Inuit]] of [[Nunatsiavut]], the Southern [[Inuit]]-[[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] of [[NunatuKavut]], and the [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nitassinan: The Innu Struggle to Reclaim Their Homeland |publisher=[[Douglas & McIntyre]] |year=December 1991 |page=240 |last=Wadden |first=Marie |author-link=Marie Wadden |isbn=978-1-55365-731-6 |url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121161501/http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nLabrador is named after [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the [[Labrador Peninsula|Peninsula]] in 1498\u201399. ''Lavrador'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means \"farmer\", as does its [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''labrador''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:Labrador fullmap.gif|thumb|left|Map of Labrador.]]\n\nLabrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the [[Canadian Shield]], a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into [[Hudson Bay]] are part of Quebec. Northern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Polar climate|polar]], while Southern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]].\n\nLabrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.\n\n===North Coast===\n\nFrom Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the [[Torngat Mountains]], named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to [[Cape Chidley]], the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to [[Mount Caubvick]], the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, [[Natuashish]]. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with [[snowmobile]]s, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].\n\n==== Nunatsiavut ====\n[[Nunatsiavut]] is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2000. The Settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador's North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.\n[[File:Kiglapait Mountains, Labrador.jpg|thumb|Icy Labrador coast and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] on the north coast of Labrador]]\n\n===Central Labrador===\n\n[[Central Labrador]] extends from the shores of [[Lake Melville]] into the interior. It contains the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]], the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at [[Churchill Falls]] is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] under a long-term contract. The [[Lower Churchill Project]] will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as \"the heart of the Big Land\", the area's population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.\n\nCentral Labrador is also home to [[Happy Valley \u2013 Goose Bay]]. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during [[World War II]], [[CFB Goose Bay]] is now operated as a [[NATO]] tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States' [[Space Shuttle]]. Other major communities in the area are [[North West River, Newfoundland and Labrador|North West River]] and the large [[Indian reserve|reserve]] known as [[Sheshatshiu]].\n\n===Western Labrador===\n[[File:Open_pit_iron_mine,_Labrador.jpg|right|thumb|Open pit  [[Iron Ore Company of Canada|iron mine]] in Labrador West]]\nThe highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the [[Innu]] First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the [[Smallwood Reservoir]] has flooded much of the old hunting land\u2014submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.\n\nWestern Labrador is also home to the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], which operates a large iron ore mine in [[Labrador City]]. Together with the small community of [[Wabush]], the two towns are known as \"Labrador West\".\n\n=== South Coast ===\n\n====NunatuKavut====\nFrom [[Hamilton Inlet]] to [[Cape St. Charles]]/[[St. Lewis, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lewis]], [[NunatuKavut]] is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador [[M\u00e9tis]]). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] is the largest.\n\n====The Labrador Straits====\nFrom Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the [[Labrador Current]].\n\n[[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The [[lighthouse]] at [[Point Amour Lighthouse|Point Amour]] is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. [[MV Kamutik]], a passenger ferry between the mainland and [[St. Barbe, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Barbe]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], is based in [[Blanc Sablon, Quebec]], near the Labrador border. [[L'Anse-au-Loup]] is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. [[L'Anse-au-Clair]] is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.\n\n===Time zones of Labrador===\n\nMost of Labrador (from [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] north and west) uses [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|Atlantic Time]] (UTC\u22124 in winter, UTC\u22123 in summer). The southeastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|Newfoundland Time]] (UTC\u22123:30 in winter, UTC\u22122:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Innu making canoes near Sheshatshiu, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Innu making canoes ca. 1920]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Fours de fonte d'huile de baleine.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque]] whale oil melting factory at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]]]]\nEarly settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] (or [[Innu]]) and [[Inuit]], although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.\n\nIt is believed that the [[Norsemen]] were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD, but no Norse remains have been found on the North American mainland. The area was known as ''[[Markland]]'' in [[Greenlandic Norse]] and its inhabitants were known as ''[[skr\u00e6lingjar]]''.\n\nIn 1499 and 1500, Portuguese explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] reached what was probably Labrador today and that is believed to be the origin of the name Labrador.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author=Bailey W.

On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place-names include ''Terra de los Ingres'' (Land of the English), and ''Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall'' (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Further south, we notice ''Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall'' (Land of \"Corte-Real\" and of the King of Portugal) and ''terra de pescaria'' (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenb\u00fcttel map, believed to be the work of [[Diogo Ribeiro]], along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: ''As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.'' This is believed to be Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as Greenland.<ref>See James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (London, 1962), pp. 98, 120\u20131, 312\u201317.</ref> Labrador (\"lavrador\" in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from \"labour\" in Latin) \u2014the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada's oldest European settlements.\n\nIn 1542 Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this \"new land\" its Latin name ''Terranova''. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called ''Butus'' and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the ''San Juan'', sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/articles/Red-Bay-a-corner-of-Canada-that-is-forever-Basque|last=Richardson|first=Nigel|title=A corner of Canada that is forever Basque|date=1 June 2015|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moravian Brethren]] of [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]], first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the [[Grenfell Mission]] (see [[Wilfred Grenfell]]). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and later [[Canadian National Railway]]/[[CN Marine]]/[[Marine Atlantic]] became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.\n\nLabrador was within [[New France]] mostly by 1748. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]] transferred New France (including Labrador though excluding the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] southwest of Newfoundland) to the British, which administered the area as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in [[Lower Canada]]. However, in 1809 the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing [[Newfoundland Colony]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n{{Further|Newfoundland National Convention|1948 Newfoundland referendums|Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|selfref=|label1=|label3=}}\nAs part of [[Newfoundland]] since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by [[Quebec]] until the British resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|entered into confederation]], becoming part of Canada (see above artices for full information).\n\n[[File:Moravian Church, Nain, NL, exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was established in 1771 by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries]]\nLabrador played strategic roles during both [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In October 1943, a German [[U-boat]] crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named [[Weather Station Kurt]]; the installation of the equipment was the only (known) armed, German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until the 1980s when a historian, working with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the [[Canadian War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/ops/weather_stations.htm |title=Weather station Kurt erected in Labrador in 1943 | accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government built a major air force base at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], at the head of [[Lake Melville]] during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate [[CFB Goose Bay]] is one of the largest employers for the community of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]].\n\nAdditionally, both the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]] built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the [[Pinetree Line]], [[Mid-Canada Line]] and [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]] systems. Today the remaining stations are automated as part of the [[North Warning System]], however the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest [[iron ore]] deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright]], [[Schefferville, Quebec|Schefferville]], Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe present community of [[Labrador West, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador West]] is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to transport ore concentrate 578 kilometres (359 miles) south to the port of [[Sept-\u00celes, Quebec]], for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area \u2013 today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.\n\nConstruction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45&nbsp;km west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that will deliver power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.<ref>http://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/team-work-and-dedication-brings-the-link-to-completion/</ref>\n\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright, Quebec]] (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from [[Baie-Comeau]], [[Quebec]]). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These \"highways\" are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and are not completely paved.\n\nA study on a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Channel \u2013 Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAlthough a [[Trans-Labrador Highway|highway link]] has, as of 16 December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed [[Quebec Route 138|Quebec North Shore highway]] that presently does not exist. Part of the \"highway\", [[Quebec Route 389|Route 389]], starting approximately {{convert|212|km|mi}} from Baie-Comeau to {{convert|482|km|mi}}, is of an inferior alignment, and from there to {{convert|570|km|mi}}, the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.\n\nRoute 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada's [[National Highway System (Canada)|National Highway System]] in September 2005.\n\n[[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]].\n\n==Boundary dispute==\n[[Image:Labrador boundary dispute.png|thumb|Line A: the boundary decided by the Privy Council; the current legal boundary.

In 1809 Labrador had been transferred from [[Lower Canada]] to [[Newfoundland Colony]] but the inland boundary of Labrador had never been precisely stated.<ref name=\"marianopolis\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/NFLDHistory/Quebec-NewfoundlandLabradorBoundaryIssue.htm|title = Labrador-Canada boundary|publisher = marianopolis| accessdate = 2008-03-20 | last= |quote=Labrador Act, 1809. \u2013 An imperial act (49 Geo.

({{IPAc-en|l|\u00e6|b|r|\u0259|\u02c8|d|\u0254\u02d0r}} {{respell|lab|r\u0259-DOR}}) is a geographic and cultural region within the Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. It is the continental portion of the province and constitutes  71% of the province's area but is home to only 6% of the province's population. It is separated from the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Strait of Belle Isle]]. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\nLabrador occupies most of the eastern part of the [[Labrador Peninsula]]. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]].\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Labrador include the Northern [[Inuit]] of [[Nunatsiavut]], the Southern [[Inuit]]-[[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] of [[NunatuKavut]], and the [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nitassinan: The Innu Struggle to Reclaim Their Homeland |publisher=[[Douglas & McIntyre]] |year=December 1991 |page=240 |last=Wadden |first=Marie |author-link=Marie Wadden |isbn=978-1-55365-731-6 |url=http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130121161501/http://www.dmpibooks.com/book/nitassinan |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2012-11-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nLabrador is named after [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]], a Portuguese explorer who sailed along the coasts of the [[Labrador Peninsula|Peninsula]] in 1498\u201399. ''Lavrador'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] means \"farmer\", as does its [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent ''labrador''.\n\n==Geography==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:Labrador fullmap.gif|thumb|left|Map of Labrador.]]\n\nLabrador has a roughly triangular shape that encompasses the easternmost section of the [[Canadian Shield]], a sweeping geographical region of thin soil and abundant mineral resources. Its western border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands that drain into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are part of Labrador, while lands that drain into [[Hudson Bay]] are part of Quebec. Northern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Polar climate|polar]], while Southern Labrador's climate is classified as [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]].\n\nLabrador can be divided into four geographical regions: the North Coast, Central Labrador, Western Labrador, and the South Coast. Each of those regions is described below.\n\n===North Coast===\n\nFrom Cape Chidley to Hamilton Inlet, the long, thin, northern tip of Labrador holds the [[Torngat Mountains]], named after an Inuit spirit believed to inhabit them. The mountains stretch along the coast from Port Manvers to [[Cape Chidley]], the northernmost point of Labrador. The Torngat Mountain range is also home to [[Mount Caubvick]], the highest point in the province. This area is predominantly Inuit, with the exception of a small Innu community, [[Natuashish]]. The North Coast is the most isolated region of Labrador, with [[snowmobile]]s, boats, and planes being the only modern modes of transportation. The largest community in this region is [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]].\n\n==== Nunatsiavut ====\n[[Nunatsiavut]] is an Inuit self-government region in Labrador created on June 23, 2000. The Settlement area comprises the majority of Labrador's North Coast, while the land-use area also includes land farther to the interior and in Central Labrador. Nain is the administrative centre.\n[[File:Kiglapait Mountains, Labrador.jpg|thumb|Icy Labrador coast and [[Kiglapait Mountains]] on the north coast of Labrador]]\n\n===Central Labrador===\n\n[[Central Labrador]] extends from the shores of [[Lake Melville]] into the interior. It contains the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]], the largest river in Labrador and one of the largest in Canada. The hydroelectric dam at [[Churchill Falls]] is the second-largest underground power station in the world. Most of the supply is bought by [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]] under a long-term contract. The [[Lower Churchill Project]] will develop the remaining potential of the river and supply it to provincial consumers. Known as \"the heart of the Big Land\", the area's population comprises people from all groups and regions of Labrador.\n\nCentral Labrador is also home to [[Happy Valley \u2013 Goose Bay]]. Once a refuelling point for plane convoys to Europe during [[World War II]], [[CFB Goose Bay]] is now operated as a [[NATO]] tactical flight training site. It was an alternate landing zone for the United States' [[Space Shuttle]]. Other major communities in the area are [[North West River, Newfoundland and Labrador|North West River]] and the large [[Indian reserve|reserve]] known as [[Sheshatshiu]].\n\n===Western Labrador===\n[[File:Open_pit_iron_mine,_Labrador.jpg|right|thumb|Open pit  [[Iron Ore Company of Canada|iron mine]] in Labrador West]]\nThe highlands above the Churchill Falls were once an ancient hunting ground for the [[Innu]] First Nations and settled trappers of Labrador. After the construction of the hydroelectric dam at Churchill Falls in 1970, the [[Smallwood Reservoir]] has flooded much of the old hunting land\u2014submerging several grave sites and trapping cabins in the process.\n\nWestern Labrador is also home to the [[Iron Ore Company of Canada]], which operates a large iron ore mine in [[Labrador City]]. Together with the small community of [[Wabush]], the two towns are known as \"Labrador West\".\n\n=== South Coast ===\n\n====NunatuKavut====\nFrom [[Hamilton Inlet]] to [[Cape St. Charles]]/[[St. Lewis, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Lewis]], [[NunatuKavut]] is the territory of the NunatuKavummiut or Central-Southern Labrador Inuit (formerly known as the Labrador [[M\u00e9tis]]). It includes portions of Central and Western Labrador, but more NunatuKavummiut reside in its South Coast portion: it is peppered with tiny Inuit fishing communities, of which [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] is the largest.\n\n====The Labrador Straits====\nFrom Cape Charles to the Quebec/Labrador coastal border, the Straits is known for its Labrador sea grass (as is NunatuKavut) and the multitude of icebergs that pass by the coast via the [[Labrador Current]].\n\n[[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]] is known as one of the best examples of a preserved 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] whaling station. It is also the location of four 16th-century Spanish galleons. The [[lighthouse]] at [[Point Amour Lighthouse|Point Amour]] is the second-largest lighthouse in Canada. [[MV Kamutik]], a passenger ferry between the mainland and [[St. Barbe, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Barbe]] on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], is based in [[Blanc Sablon, Quebec]], near the Labrador border. [[L'Anse-au-Loup]] is the largest town on the Labrador Straits. [[L'Anse-au-Clair]] is a small town on the Labrador side of the border.\n\n===Time zones of Labrador===\n\nMost of Labrador (from [[Cartwright, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cartwright]] north and west) uses [[Atlantic Standard Time Zone|Atlantic Time]] (UTC\u22124 in winter, UTC\u22123 in summer). The southeastern tip nearest Newfoundland uses [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone|Newfoundland Time]] (UTC\u22123:30 in winter, UTC\u22122:30 in summer) to stay co-ordinated with the more populous part of the province.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Innu making canoes near Sheshatshiu, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Innu making canoes ca. 1920]]\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Fours de fonte d'huile de baleine.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[History of the Basques#Basque sailors|Basque]] whale oil melting factory at [[Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Red Bay]]]]\nEarly settlement in Labrador was tied to the sea as demonstrated by the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] (or [[Innu]]) and [[Inuit]], although these peoples also made significant forays throughout the interior.\n\nIt is believed that the [[Norsemen]] were the first Europeans to sight Labrador around 1000 AD, but no Norse remains have been found on the North American mainland. The area was known as ''[[Markland]]'' in [[Greenlandic Norse]] and its inhabitants were known as ''[[skr\u00e6lingjar]]''.\n\nIn 1499 and 1500, Portuguese explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] reached what was probably Labrador today and that is believed to be the origin of the name Labrador.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author=Bailey W.

On the extreme northeast promontory of North America, Maggiolo place-names include ''Terra de los Ingres'' (Land of the English), and ''Terra de Lavorador de rey de portugall'' (Land of Lavrador of the King of Portugal). Further south, we notice ''Terra de corte real e de rey de portugall'' (Land of \"Corte-Real\" and of the King of Portugal) and ''terra de pescaria'' (Land for Fishing). In the 1532 Wolfenb\u00fcttel map, believed to be the work of [[Diogo Ribeiro]], along the coast of Greenland, the following legend was added: ''As he who first sighted it was a farmer from the Azores Islands, this name remains attached to that country.'' This is believed to be Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. For the first seven decades or so of the sixteenth century, the name Labrador was sometimes also applied to what we know as Greenland.<ref>See James A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery under Henry VII (London, 1962), pp. 98, 120\u20131, 312\u201317.</ref> Labrador (\"lavrador\" in Portuguese) means husbandman or farmer of a tract of land (from \"labour\" in Latin) \u2014the land of the labourer. European settlement was largely concentrated in coastal communities, particularly those south of St. Lewis and Cape Charles, and are among Canada's oldest European settlements.\n\nIn 1542 Basque mariners came ashore at a natural harbour on the northeast coast of the Strait of Belle Isle. They gave this \"new land\" its Latin name ''Terranova''. A whaling station was set up around the bay, which they called ''Butus'' and is now named Red Bay after the red terracotta roof tiles they brought with them. A whaling ship, the ''San Juan'', sank there in 1565 and was raised in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/articles/Red-Bay-a-corner-of-Canada-that-is-forever-Basque|last=Richardson|first=Nigel|title=A corner of Canada that is forever Basque|date=1 June 2015|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Moravian Brethren]] of [[Herrnhut]], [[Saxony]], first came to the Labrador Coast in 1760 to minister to the migratory Inuit tribes there. They founded Nain, Okak, Hebron, Hopedale and Makkovik. Quite poor, both European and First Nations settlements along coastal Labrador came to benefit from cargo and relief vessels that were operated as part of the [[Grenfell Mission]] (see [[Wilfred Grenfell]]). Throughout the 20th century, coastal freighters and ferries operated initially by the [[Newfoundland Railway]] and later [[Canadian National Railway]]/[[CN Marine]]/[[Marine Atlantic]] became a critical lifeline for communities on the coast, which for the majority of that century did not have any road connection with the rest of North America.\n\nLabrador was within [[New France]] mostly by 1748. However, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]] transferred New France (including Labrador though excluding the islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] southwest of Newfoundland) to the British, which administered the area as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] until splitting it in two in 1791, with Labrador located in [[Lower Canada]]. However, in 1809 the British Imperial government detached Labrador from Lower Canada for transfer to the separate, self-governing [[Newfoundland Colony]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n{{Further|Newfoundland National Convention|1948 Newfoundland referendums|Canadian Confederation#Joining Confederation|selfref=|label1=|label3=}}\nAs part of [[Newfoundland]] since 1809, Labrador was still being disputed by [[Quebec]] until the British resolved their border in 1927. In 1949, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|entered into confederation]], becoming part of Canada (see above artices for full information).\n\n[[File:Moravian Church, Nain, NL, exterior.JPG|thumb|[[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was established in 1771 by [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries]]\nLabrador played strategic roles during both [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In October 1943, a German [[U-boat]] crew installed an automated weather station on the northern tip of Labrador near Cape Chidley, code-named [[Weather Station Kurt]]; the installation of the equipment was the only (known) armed, German military operation on the North American mainland during the war. The station broadcast weather observations to the German navy for only a few days, but was not discovered until the 1980s when a historian, working with the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], identified its location and mounted an expedition to recover it. The station is now exhibited in the [[Canadian War Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/ops/weather_stations.htm |title=Weather station Kurt erected in Labrador in 1943 | accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian government built a major air force base at [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]], at the head of [[Lake Melville]] during the Second World War, a site selected because of its topography, access to the sea, defensible location, and minimal fog. During the Second World War and the Cold War, the base was also home to American, British, and later German, Dutch, and Italian detachments. Today, Serco, the company contracted to operate [[CFB Goose Bay]] is one of the largest employers for the community of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]].\n\nAdditionally, both the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[United States Air Force]] built and operated a number of radar stations along coastal Labrador as part of the [[Pinetree Line]], [[Mid-Canada Line]] and [[Distant Early Warning Line|DEW Line]] systems. Today the remaining stations are automated as part of the [[North Warning System]], however the military settlements during the early part of the Cold War surrounding these stations have largely continued as local Innu and Inuit populations have clustered near their port and airfield facilities.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, some of the largest [[iron ore]] deposits in the world were discovered in the western part of Labrador and adjacent areas of Quebec. Deposits at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright]], [[Schefferville, Quebec|Schefferville]], Labrador City, and Wabush drove industrial development and human settlement in the area during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe present community of [[Labrador West, Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador West]] is entirely a result of the iron ore mining activities in the region. The Iron Ore Company of Canada operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to transport ore concentrate 578 kilometres (359 miles) south to the port of [[Sept-\u00celes, Quebec]], for shipment to steel mills in North America and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] (Labrador name: Grand River) was diverted at Churchill Falls, resulting in the flooding of an enormous area \u2013 today named the Smallwood Reservoir after Joey Smallwood, the first premier of Newfoundland. The flooding of the reservoir destroyed large areas of habitat for the threatened Woodland Caribou. A hydroelectric generating station was built in Labrador and a transmission line to the neighbouring province of Quebec.\n\nConstruction of a large hydroelectric dam project at Muskrat Falls began in 2012 by Nalcor Energy and the Province of Newfoundland. Muskrat Falls is 45&nbsp;km west of Happy Valley-Goose Bay on the Grand River (Newfoundland name: Churchill River). A transmission line began construction in October 2014 and was completed in 2016 that will deliver power down to the southern tip of Labrador and underwater across the strait of Belle Isle to the Province of Newfoundland in 2018.<ref>http://muskratfalls.nalcorenergy.com/team-work-and-dedication-brings-the-link-to-completion/</ref>\n\nFrom the 1970s to early 2000s, the [[Trans-Labrador Highway]] was built in stages to connect various inland communities with the North American highway network at [[Mont Wright (Quebec)|Mont Wright, Quebec]] (which in turn is connected by a highway running north from [[Baie-Comeau]], [[Quebec]]). A southern extension of this highway has opened in stages during the early 2000s and is resulting in significant changes to the coastal ferry system in the Strait of Belle Isle and southeastern Labrador. These \"highways\" are so called only because of their importance to the region; they would be better described as roads, and are not completely paved.\n\nA study on a [[Newfoundland-Labrador fixed link|fixed link]] to Newfoundland, in 2004, recommended that a tunnel under the [[Strait of Belle Isle]], being a single railway that would carry cars, buses and trucks, was technologically the best option for such a link. However, the study also concluded that a fixed link was not economically viable. Conceivably, if built with federal aid, the 1949 terms of union would be amended to remove ferry service from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[Channel \u2013 Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAlthough a [[Trans-Labrador Highway|highway link]] has, as of 16 December 2009, been completed across Labrador, this route is somewhat longer than a proposed [[Quebec Route 138|Quebec North Shore highway]] that presently does not exist. Part of the \"highway\", [[Quebec Route 389|Route 389]], starting approximately {{convert|212|km|mi}} from Baie-Comeau to {{convert|482|km|mi}}, is of an inferior alignment, and from there to {{convert|570|km|mi}}, the provincial border, is an accident-prone section notorious for its poor surface and sharp curves. Quebec in April 2009 announced major upgrades to Route 389 to be carried out.\n\nRoute 389 and the Trans-Labrador Highway were added to Canada's [[National Highway System (Canada)|National Highway System]] in September 2005.\n\n[[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] constitutes a federal electoral district electing one member to the [[House of Commons of Canada]]. Due to its size, distinct nature, and large Aboriginal population, Labrador has one seat despite having the smallest population of any electoral district in Canada. Formerly, Labrador was part of a riding that included part of the Island of Newfoundland. Labrador is divided into four provincial electoral districts in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly]].\n\n==Boundary dispute==\n[[Image:Labrador boundary dispute.png|thumb|Line A: the boundary decided by the Privy Council; the current legal boundary.

In 1809 Labrador had been transferred from [[Lower Canada]] to [[Newfoundland Colony]] but the inland boundary of Labrador had never been precisely stated.<ref name=\"marianopolis\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/NFLDHistory/Quebec-NewfoundlandLabradorBoundaryIssue.htm|title = Labrador-Canada boundary|publisher = marianopolis| accessdate = 2008-03-20 | last= |quote=Labrador Act, 1809. \u2013 An imperial act (49 Geo.

He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]].

In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''.

His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

One can see the top of the local [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified church]]'s tower on the right.]]\n'''Ghimbav''' ({{lang-de|Weidenbach}}; {{lang-hu|Vidomb\u00e1k}}) is a town in [[Bra\u0219ov County]], [[Transylvania]], central [[Romania]]. It is located in the centre of Romania, 5 miles (8 km) west of [[Bra\u0219ov]].\n\n==History==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|2002 |5112\n|2011 |4698\n}}\n\nThe town was first mentioned in a letter written in 1420 by [[King of Hungary|King]] [[Sigismund of Luxembourg|Sigismund]] of [[Hungary]]. He advised the inhabitants of Weidenbach/Ghimbav to join their forces together with the people living in three other neighboring Saxon villages (Petersberg/[[S\u00e2npetru]], Honigberg/[[H\u0103rman]] and Brenndorf/[[Bod, Bra\u0219ov|Bod]]) and contribute to the construction of the stone fortress of [[Bra\u0219ov]]. \n\nThe Ottomans invaded Ghimbav in 1422. In 1469 a major fire damaged the town. In 1611 the Hungarian prince [[Gabriel B\u00e1thory]] set fire to several villages in [[Burzenland]] (\u0162ara B\u00e2rsei); Ghimbav was one of them. \n\nThe local church and the bell tower were built around 1300.

It is located in the centre of Romania, 5 miles (8 km) west of [[Bra\u0219ov]].\n\n==History==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|2002 |5112\n|2011 |4698\n}}\n\nThe town was first mentioned in a letter written in 1420 by [[King of Hungary|King]] [[Sigismund of Luxembourg|Sigismund]] of [[Hungary]]. He advised the inhabitants of Weidenbach/Ghimbav to join their forces together with the people living in three other neighboring Saxon villages (Petersberg/[[S\u00e2npetru]], Honigberg/[[H\u0103rman]] and Brenndorf/[[Bod, Bra\u0219ov|Bod]]) and contribute to the construction of the stone fortress of [[Bra\u0219ov]]. \n\nThe Ottomans invaded Ghimbav in 1422. In 1469 a major fire damaged the town. In 1611 the Hungarian prince [[Gabriel B\u00e1thory]] set fire to several villages in [[Burzenland]] (\u0162ara B\u00e2rsei); Ghimbav was one of them. \n\nThe local church and the bell tower were built around 1300. In the 15th century a fortress was built around the church. It was hit by lightning in 1642 and suffered major damages. In 1666 the city hall was moved inside the fortress as well as several other houses. These houses were demolished in 1940.

Following high investment, fast online ordering and delivery service and explosive internet marketing, Luckin Coffee became the most popular Chinese coffee brand.\n\nThe company's early marketing centered around freebees, where each new customer was offered a free drink and a 50%-off coupon for one cup. They also offered \"buy one, get one free\" coupons for loyal customers. These  discounts made its price lower than Starbucks and attracted a bigger number of returning customers in the early stage of its business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107124545/https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/3565538|title=\u4e2d\u570b\u300c\u745e\u5e78\u5496\u5561\u300d\u7206\u7d05 \u661f\u5df4\u514b\u60e1\u5922\uff1f|last=|first=|date=29 December 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe brand also has a strong focus on technology.

Although most of its stores do not have seats or other services for customers,  and are in less prestigious locations compared to Starbucks, the brand has been able to capture a new generation of consumers and rival Starbucks in China.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-stock-breakingviews-idUSKBN1ZZ0E9|title=Breakingviews - China fortune hard to read in Luckin Coffee beans|date=2020-02-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-03-03|language=en}}</ref> The target customers of Luckin Coffee are white-collar workers and students near the stores who do not have much time to drink coffee at stores.\n\nCustomers need to download the Luckin Coffee App to order and pay for drinks online.<ref name=\"qz 16162702\">{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1616270/luckin-ipo-what-you-can-eat-and-drink-at-chinas-starbucks-rival/|title=What you can eat and drink at Starbucks\u2019s China rival|author=Mary Hui|date=14 May 2019|website=Qz.com|accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://m.wallstreetcn.com/articles/3469254|title=\u745e\u5e78\u6253\u8d25\u4e0d\u4e86\u661f\u5df4\u514b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5fc5\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2aofo|last=|first=|date=15 January 2019|website=\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u89c1\u95fb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Luckin Coffee also cooperates with the second largest courier in China, [[SF Express]], delivering orders to customers within two kilometers around each store.

Starbucks dismissed these allegations as a marketing stunt. On May 16, 2018, the case was officially put on file by the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court. In October 2019, Luckin Coffee unilaterally withdrew the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sina.com.cn/s/2019-11-14/doc-iihnzhfy9237955.shtml|title=\u5386\u7ecf16\u4e2a\u6708 \u745e\u5e78\u8d77\u8bc9\u661f\u5df4\u514b\u6848\u5df2\u7531\u745e\u5e78\u5355\u65b9\u9762\u64a4\u8bc9|last=|first=|date=14 November 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Short-seller allegations ====\nOn January 31, 2020, short-seller Muddy Waters Research published an anonymous 89-page report on Twitter, claiming that Luckin Coffee had falsified financial and operational figures. The report claimed that the number of items sold per store was inflated by at least 69% in the third  and by 88% the fourth quarter of 2019, supposedly backed by 11,200 hours of video footage. Before the U.S. stock market opening on February 3, 2020, Luckin Coffee responded by categorically denying all allegations made in the report. The company argued that the report raised malicious accusations and false allegations with unsubstantiated evidence and flawed methodology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-03/luckin-coffee-responds-to-anonymous-report-containing-misleading-and-false-allegations|title=Luckin Coffee Responds to Anonymous Report Containing Misleading and False Allegations|last=|first=|date=3 February 2020|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\nPurchases can only be made through the Luckin mobile application.<ref name=\"qz 1616270\">{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1616270/luckin-ipo-what-you-can-eat-and-drink-at-chinas-starbucks-rival/|title=What you can eat and drink at Starbucks\u2019s China rival|author=Mary Hui|date=14 May 2019|website=Qz.com|accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nLuckin offers coffee-based drinks regularly found in other coffee shops, and has a selection of recipes custom-made for the palates of the Chinese consumers.<ref name=\"qz 1616270\"/>\n\nLuckin Coffee hired Hidenori Izaki (2014 [[World Barista Champion]]) to advise the company on recipes and store designs.<ref name=\"qz 1616270\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Coffee|Companies|Food}}\n* [[Coffee culture]]\n* [[List of coffee companies]]\n* [[List of coffeehouse chains]]\n* [[Multinational corporation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Chinese companies established in 2017]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Xiamen]]\n[[Category:Coffee houses of China]]\n[[Category:Fast-food chains of China]]\n[[Category:Food and drink companies established in 2017]]\n[[Category:Restaurant chains in China]]\n[[Category:Restaurants established in 2017]]\n[[Category:Chinese brands]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:2019 initial public offerings]]\n\n\n{{china-company-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Isenta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOperations:a word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luckin_Coffee"}
