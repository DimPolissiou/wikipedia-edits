Contestants play against a professional quizzer, known as the \"chaser\", who attempts to prevent them from winning a cash prize. The chasers are [[Mark Labbett]], [[Shaun Wallace]], [[Anne Hegerty]], [[Paul Sinha]] and [[Jenny Ryan]]. Labbett and Wallace have both been chasers since series 1, while Hegerty joined in series 2, Sinha in series 4 and Ryan in series 9. With rare exceptions for special episodes, only one chaser participates in any given episode.\n\nA team of four contestants individually attempt to amass as much money as possible, which is later added to a prize fund if the contestant survives their individual chase. The chaser must attempt to catch each contestant during their individual chase, eliminating that person from the game and preventing the money from being added to the collective prize fund. In the individual chase, the player must choose between a higher offer, their earned money, and a lower offer. Later, in the final round, contestants who survived their individual chases play collectively as a team against the chaser for an equal share of the prize fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itvmedia.co.uk/the-chase|title=The Chase|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|accessdate=24 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708073555/http://www.itvmedia.co.uk/the-chase|archivedate=8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith a regular audience of three to five million, ''The Chase'' is one of ITV's most successful daytime shows ever.<ref name=\"Pointless rivalry\">{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/21/the-chase-stars-mark-labbett-and-anne-hegerty-discuss-their-ntas-win-twitter-reactions-and-pointless-rivalry-5636444/|title=The Chase's Mark Labbett and Anne Hegerty talk NTA wins and Pointless rivalry|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=21 January 2016|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> It has been nominated six times at the [[National Television Awards]], winning in 2016, 2017, and 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/chase-wins-best-daytime-show-7214492|title=The Chase wins Best Daytime show at 2016 National Television Awards|last=Greenwood|first=Carl|date=20 January 2016|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> It has also become a successful international franchise: regional versions have been made in Australia, China, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Norway, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, United States and Spain. Labbett, Hegerty and Wallace also feature as chasers on the [[The Chase Australia|Australian version]]. Labbett featured as the sole chaser on the [[The Chase (American game show)|now-defunct American version]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Cash Builder and Head-to-Head rounds===\nEach contestant individually attempts to build up the team's prize fund through two rounds. In the first round, known as the \"Cash Builder\", the contestant answers as many questions as they can within one minute, earning \u00a31,000 per correct answer. After completing the Cash Builder, the contestant enters the \"Head-to-Head\" round, attempting to move the money down to the bottom of a seven-step board and into the team bank (\"home\") without being caught by the chaser. The board had eight steps in the first series.\n\nThe contestant chooses one of three starting positions on the board:\n\n* Three steps down from the top, giving a three-step head start and requiring five steps to reach home\n* Two steps down, with a two-step head start and requiring six steps to reach home, for a larger amount\n* Four steps down, with a four-step head start and requiring four steps to reach home, for a smaller amount\n\nThe smaller amount can be zero or even negative if the contestant has performed poorly in the Cash Builder. Once the starting position is chosen, the host asks a series of multiple-choice questions to the contestant and the chaser, both of whom secretly select one of the three answer options on keypads. After either person locks in a guess, the other must do so within five seconds or be locked out for that turn. A correct answer moves the person who gave it one step down the board, while a miss or lock-out leaves them where they are. \n\nIf the contestant successfully reaches home without being caught, they advance to the Final Chase and their money is added to the team's prize fund (or deducted, if they took a negative amount). If the chaser catches up, the contestant is eliminated and their money is forfeited. If all four contestants are caught by the chaser, they nominate one contestant to play the Final Chase alone.\n\nIn the celebrity editions, which are played to benefit charitable organisations named by the participants, the lowest offer is always \u00a31,000. This amount is donated to each celebrity's chosen charity if they are all caught, or if they lose the Final Chase.\n\n===Final Chase===\nThe contestants who win their head-to-head chases must work together in order to beat the chaser and win their prize fund. They choose one of two sets of questions for themselves, with the other set put aside for the chaser, and then have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible on the buzzer. If a contestant responds without buzzing-in, their answer is not accepted. The buzzer is not used if only one contestant is participating in the Final Chase. Every correct answer moves the team one step ahead of the chaser, and they are given a head start of one step per contestant playing in this round. The contestants may not discuss or confer on any questions during this portion of the round.\n\nOnce the team's time has expired, the chaser is given two minutes to answer questions from the unused set and catch the team, moving one step ahead per correct response. If the chaser passes or misses a question, the clock is briefly stopped and the team are given a chance to discuss it and respond; a correct answer pushes the chaser back one step, or (from series 3 onwards) moves the team ahead one step if the chaser is at the starting line.\n\nIf the chaser fails to catch up to the team before time runs out, the participating contestants split the prize fund equally; otherwise, they leave with nothing. If all four contestants have lost their head-to-head chases and the contestant they nominate wins the Final Chase, every contestant wins \u00a31,000.\n\n===Filming===\nThree episodes are filmed in a day and each one takes around an hour and a half to film. According to Walsh, \"It runs like clockwork.\" The Final Chase can be stopped and re-started if Walsh stumbles on a question. He told the ''[[Radio Times]]'', \"If there is a slight misread, I am stopped immediately \u2013 bang \u2013 by the lawyers. We have the compliance lawyers in the studio all the time. What you have to do is go back to the start of the question, literally on videotape where my mouth opens \u2013 or where it's closed from the previous question \u2013 and the question is re-asked. It is stopped to the split second.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-11-22/secrets-of-the-chase/|title=Secrets of The Chase|last=Daly|first=Emma|date=22 November 2018|website=Radio Times|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Chasers==\n*'''[[Mark Labbett]]''' (2009\u2013present)\u2014Appeared on ''[[Stake Out (game show)|Stake Out]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[University Challenge]]'', ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[The Syndicate (game show)|The Syndicate]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

As many contestants are comedians or actors, there is a much-higher comedic element. The game is played exactly the same way as the regular version. However, if all four celebrities have been caught by the chaser, the prize fund during the Final Chase is \u00a320,000 (originally \u00a34,000). If the team is caught during the Final Chase, a consolation prize of \u00a31,000 is awarded to the charities for each celebrity who advanced to this stage.\n\nIn February 2017, ITV commissioned ''The Family Chase'', a spin-off featuring a team of four family members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a821231/the-chase-family-series-itv-saturday/|title=''The Chase'' is coming back to ITV with a family twist|work=Digital Spy|date=14 February 2017|first=Jennifer|last=Read-Dominguez}}</ref> The six episode spin-off debuted on 2 September 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Duncan|title=Bradley Walsh reveals all on new series ''The Family Chase'' and the secrets of The Chasers|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/01/bradley-walsh-reveals-all-on-new-series-the-family-chase-and-the-secrets-of-the-chasers-6886794/amp|website=Metro|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> A second series of 8 episodes was commissioned and commenced airing on 24 March 2019.\n\nIn November 2019, ITV commissioned another spin-off called ''Beat The Chasers''.

Contestants play against a professional quizzer, known as the \"chaser\", who attempts to prevent them from winning a cash prize. The chasers are [[Mark Labbett]], [[Shaun Wallace]], [[Anne Hegerty]], [[Paul Sinha]] and [[Jenny Ryan]]. Labbett and Wallace have both been chasers since series 1, while Hegerty joined in series 2, Sinha in series 4 and Ryan in series 9. With rare exceptions for special episodes, only one chaser participates in any given episode.\n\nA team of four contestants individually attempt to amass as much money as possible, which is later added to a prize fund if the contestant survives their individual chase. The chaser must attempt to catch each contestant during their individual chase, eliminating that person from the game and preventing the money from being added to the collective prize fund. In the individual chase, the player must choose between a higher offer, their earned money, and a lower offer. Later, in the final round, contestants who survived their individual chases play collectively as a team against the chaser for an equal share of the prize fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itvmedia.co.uk/the-chase|title=The Chase|publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|accessdate=24 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708073555/http://www.itvmedia.co.uk/the-chase|archivedate=8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith a regular audience of three to five million, ''The Chase'' is one of ITV's most successful daytime shows ever.<ref name=\"Pointless rivalry\">{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/21/the-chase-stars-mark-labbett-and-anne-hegerty-discuss-their-ntas-win-twitter-reactions-and-pointless-rivalry-5636444/|title=The Chase's Mark Labbett and Anne Hegerty talk NTA wins and Pointless rivalry|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=21 January 2016|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> It has been nominated six times at the [[National Television Awards]], winning in 2016, 2017, and 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/chase-wins-best-daytime-show-7214492|title=The Chase wins Best Daytime show at 2016 National Television Awards|last=Greenwood|first=Carl|date=20 January 2016|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref> It has also become a successful international franchise: regional versions have been made in Australia, China, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Israel, Norway, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, United States and Spain. Labbett, Hegerty and Wallace also feature as chasers on the [[The Chase Australia|Australian version]]. Labbett featured as the sole chaser on the [[The Chase (American game show)|now-defunct American version]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Cash Builder and Head-to-Head rounds===\nEach contestant individually attempts to build up the team's prize fund through two rounds. In the first round, known as the \"Cash Builder\", the contestant answers as many questions as they can within one minute, earning \u00a31,000 per correct answer. After completing the Cash Builder, the contestant enters the \"Head-to-Head\" round, attempting to move the money down to the bottom of a seven-step board and into the team bank (\"home\") without being caught by the chaser. The board had eight steps in the first series.\n\nThe contestant chooses one of three starting positions on the board:\n\n* Three steps down from the top, giving a three-step head start and requiring five steps to reach home\n* Two steps down, with a two-step head start and requiring six steps to reach home, for a larger amount\n* Four steps down, with a four-step head start and requiring four steps to reach home, for a smaller amount\n\nThe smaller amount can be zero or even negative if the contestant has performed poorly in the Cash Builder. Once the starting position is chosen, the host asks a series of multiple-choice questions to the contestant and the chaser, both of whom secretly select one of the three answer options on keypads. After either person locks in a guess, the other must do so within five seconds or be locked out for that turn. A correct answer moves the person who gave it one step down the board, while a miss or lock-out leaves them where they are. \n\nIf the contestant successfully reaches home without being caught, they advance to the Final Chase and their money is added to the team's prize fund (or deducted, if they took a negative amount). If the chaser catches up, the contestant is eliminated and their money is forfeited. If all four contestants are caught by the chaser, they nominate one contestant to play the Final Chase alone.\n\nIn the celebrity editions, which are played to benefit charitable organisations named by the participants, the lowest offer is always \u00a31,000. This amount is donated to each celebrity's chosen charity if they are all caught, or if they lose the Final Chase.\n\n===Final Chase===\nThe contestants who win their head-to-head chases must work together in order to beat the chaser and win their prize fund. They choose one of two sets of questions for themselves, with the other set put aside for the chaser, and then have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible on the buzzer. If a contestant responds without buzzing-in, their answer is not accepted. The buzzer is not used if only one contestant is participating in the Final Chase. Every correct answer moves the team one step ahead of the chaser, and they are given a head start of one step per contestant playing in this round. The contestants may not discuss or confer on any questions during this portion of the round.\n\nOnce the team's time has expired, the chaser is given two minutes to answer questions from the unused set and catch the team, moving one step ahead per correct response. If the chaser passes or misses a question, the clock is briefly stopped and the team are given a chance to discuss it and respond; a correct answer pushes the chaser back one step, or (from series 3 onwards) moves the team ahead one step if the chaser is at the starting line.\n\nIf the chaser fails to catch up to the team before time runs out, the participating contestants split the prize fund equally; otherwise, they leave with nothing. If all four contestants have lost their head-to-head chases and the contestant they nominate wins the Final Chase, every contestant wins \u00a31,000.\n\n===Filming===\nThree episodes are filmed in a day and each one takes around an hour and a half to film. According to Walsh, \"It runs like clockwork.\" The Final Chase can be stopped and re-started if Walsh stumbles on a question. He told the ''[[Radio Times]]'', \"If there is a slight misread, I am stopped immediately \u2013 bang \u2013 by the lawyers. We have the compliance lawyers in the studio all the time. What you have to do is go back to the start of the question, literally on videotape where my mouth opens \u2013 or where it's closed from the previous question \u2013 and the question is re-asked. It is stopped to the split second.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-11-22/secrets-of-the-chase/|title=Secrets of The Chase|last=Daly|first=Emma|date=22 November 2018|website=Radio Times|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Chasers==\n*'''[[Mark Labbett]]''' (2009\u2013present)\u2014Appeared on ''[[Stake Out (game show)|Stake Out]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[University Challenge]]'', ''[[Fifteen to One]]'', ''[[The Syndicate (game show)|The Syndicate]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

However, if all four celebrities have been caught by the chaser, the prize fund during the Final Chase is \u00a320,000 (originally \u00a34,000). If the team is caught during the Final Chase, a consolation prize of \u00a31,000 is awarded to the charities for each celebrity who advanced to this stage.\n\nIn February 2017, ITV commissioned ''The Family Chase'', a spin-off featuring a team of four family members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a821231/the-chase-family-series-itv-saturday/|title=''The Chase'' is coming back to ITV with a family twist|work=Digital Spy|date=14 February 2017|first=Jennifer|last=Read-Dominguez}}</ref> The six episode spin-off debuted on 2 September 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=Duncan|title=Bradley Walsh reveals all on new series ''The Family Chase'' and the secrets of The Chasers|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/01/bradley-walsh-reveals-all-on-new-series-the-family-chase-and-the-secrets-of-the-chasers-6886794/amp|website=Metro|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref> A second series of 8 episodes was commissioned and commenced airing on 24 March 2019.\n\nIn November 2019, ITV commissioned another spin-off called ''Beat The Chasers''.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

He has made an unsure start and, towards the end of the academic year, is concerned about losing his probationary position in the department. In his attempt to be awarded a permanent post he tries to maintain a good relationship with his absent-minded head of department, Professor Welch. To establish his credentials he must also ensure the publication of his first scholarly article, but he eventually discovers that the editor to whom he submitted it has translated it into Italian and passed it off as his own.\n\nDixon struggles with an on-again off-again \"girlfriend\", Margaret Peel, a fellow lecturer who is recovering from a [[suicide attempt]] in the wake of a broken relationship with another man. Margaret employs [[emotional blackmail]] to appeal to Dixon's sense of duty and pity while keeping him in an ambiguous and sexless limbo. While she is staying with Professor Welch, he holds a musical weekend that seems to offer an opportunity for Dixon to advance his standing among his colleagues. The attempt goes wrong, however, and the drunken Dixon drops a lighted cigarette on the bed, burning a hole in the sheets.\n\nDuring the same weekend Dixon meets Christine Callaghan, a young Londoner and the latest girlfriend of Professor Welch's son, Bertrand, an amateur painter whose affectedness particularly infuriates Dixon. After a bad start Dixon realises that he is attracted to Christine, who is far less pretentious than she initially appears.\n\nDixon's growing closeness to Christine upsets Bertrand, who is using her to reach her well-connected Scottish uncle and get a job from him. Then Dixon rescues Christine from the university's annual dance after Bertrand treats her offhandedly, and takes her home in a taxi. The pair kiss and make a date for later, but Christine admits that she feels guilty about seeing Dixon behind Bertrand's back and about Dixon's supposed relationship with Margaret. The two decide not to see each other again, but when Bertrand calls on Dixon to \"warn him off the grass\" he cannot resist the temptation to quarrel with Bertrand, until they fight.\n\nThe novel reaches its climax during Dixon's public lecture on \"[[Merry England|Merrie England]]\". Having attempted to calm his nerves by drinking too much, he caps his uncertain performance by denouncing the university culture of arty pretentiousness and passes out. Welch lets Dixon know privately that his employment will not be extended, but Christine's uncle offers Dixon the coveted job of assisting him in London. Later Dixon meets Margaret's ex-boyfriend, who reveals that he had not been her fianc\u00e9, as she had claimed. Comparing notes, the two realise that the suicide attempt was faked as a piece of neurotic emotional blackmail.\n\nFeeling free of Margaret at last, Dixon responds to Christine's phoned request to see her off as she leaves for London. There he learns from her that she is leaving Bertrand after being told that he was having an affair with the wife of one of Dixon's former colleagues. They decide to leave for London together, and then walk off arm in arm, outraging the Welches as they pass on the street.\n\n==Literary significance and legacy==\nWhen originally published, ''Lucky Jim'' received enthusiastic reviews. In the ''[[New Statesman]]'', [[Walter Allen]] wrote, \"Mr Amis has an unwaveringly merciless eye for the bogus: some aspects of provincial culture \u2013 the madrigals and recorders of Professor Welch, for instance \u2013 are pinned down as accurately as they have ever been; and he has, too, an eye for character \u2013 the female lecturer Margaret, who battens neurotically on Jim's pity, is quite horribly well done. Mr Amis is a novelist of formidable and uncomfortable talent.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/150341|title=1954 \u2013 Lucky Jim|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[W. Somerset Maugham]] praised Amis' writing while disdaining the new generation he represented: \"Mr. Kingsley Amis is so talented, his observation is so keen, that you cannot fail to be convinced that the young men he so brilliantly describes truly represent the class with which his novel is concerned\u2026.They have no manners, and are woefully unable to deal with any social predicament. Their idea of a celebration is to go to a public bar and drink six beers. They are mean, malicious and envious\u2026.They are scum.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyrb.com/products/lucky-jim|title=Lucky Jim|website=New York Review Books|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nIn response to Maugham's criticism of the new generation, the New Statesman and [[The Nation]] held contests to get readers to respond to Maugham in the voice of Jim Dixon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/05/04/something-serious/|title=Something Serious|last=Lorentzen|first=Christian|date=2015-05-04|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nRetrospective reviews have solidified its legacy as one of Amis' finest novels. [[Christopher Hitchens]] described it as the funniest book of the second half of the 20th century, writing: \"''Lucky Jim'' illustrates a crucial human difference between the little guy and the small man. And Dixon, like his creator, was no clown but a man of feeling after all.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/05/the-man-of-feeling/302486/|title=The Man of Feeling|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|date=2002-05-01|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Olivia Laing]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"Remarkable for its relentless skewering of artifice and pretension, ''Lucky Jim'' also contains some of the finest comic set pieces in the language.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/15/lucky-jim-kingsley-amis-classic|title=Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis {{!}} Classics corner|last=Laing|first=Olivia|date=2010-08-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television adaptations==\nIn the 1957 British [[Lucky Jim (1957 film)|film adaptation]], Jim Dixon was played by [[Ian Carmichael]].

The pair kiss and make a date for later, but Christine admits that she feels guilty about seeing Dixon behind Bertrand's back and about Dixon's supposed relationship with Margaret. The two decide not to see each other again, but when Bertrand calls on Dixon to \"warn him off the grass\" he cannot resist the temptation to quarrel with Bertrand, until they fight.\n\nThe novel reaches its climax during Dixon's public lecture on \"[[Merry England|Merrie England]]\". Having attempted to calm his nerves by drinking too much, he caps his uncertain performance by denouncing the university culture of arty pretentiousness and passes out. Welch lets Dixon know privately that his employment will not be extended, but Christine's uncle offers Dixon the coveted job of assisting him in London. Later Dixon meets Margaret's ex-boyfriend, who reveals that he had not been her fianc\u00e9, as she had claimed. Comparing notes, the two realise that the suicide attempt was faked as a piece of neurotic emotional blackmail.\n\nFeeling free of Margaret at last, Dixon responds to Christine's phoned request to see her off as she leaves for London. There he learns from her that she is leaving Bertrand after being told that he was having an affair with the wife of one of Dixon's former colleagues. They decide to leave for London together, and then walk off arm in arm, outraging the Welches as they pass on the street.\n\n==Literary significance and legacy==\nWhen originally published, ''Lucky Jim'' received enthusiastic reviews. In the ''[[New Statesman]]'', [[Walter Allen]] wrote, \"Mr Amis has an unwaveringly merciless eye for the bogus: some aspects of provincial culture - the madrigals and recorders of Professor Welch, for instance - are pinned down as accurately as they have ever been; and he has, too, an eye for character - the female lecturer Margaret, who battens neurotically on Jim's pity, is quite horribly well done. Mr Amis is a novelist of formidable and uncomfortable talent.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/150341|title=1954 - Lucky Jim|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[W. Somerset Maugham]] praised Amis' writing while disdaining the new generation he represented: \"Mr. Kingsley Amis is so talented, his observation is so keen, that you cannot fail to be convinced that the young men he so brilliantly describes truly represent the class with which his novel is concerned\u2026.They have no manners, and are woefully unable to deal with any social predicament. Their idea of a celebration is to go to a public bar and drink six beers. They are mean, malicious and envious\u2026.They are scum.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyrb.com/products/lucky-jim|title=Lucky Jim|website=New York Review Books|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nIn response to Maugham's criticism of the new generation, the New Statesman and [[The Nation]] held contests to get readers to respond to Maugham in the voice of Jim Dixon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/05/04/something-serious/|title=Something Serious|last=Lorentzen|first=Christian|date=2015-05-04|website=The Paris Review|language=en|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nRetrospective reviews have solidified its legacy as one of Amis' finest novels. [[Christopher Hitchens]] described it as the funniest book of the second half of the 20th century, writing: \"''Lucky Jim'' illustrates a crucial human difference between the little guy and the small man. And Dixon, like his creator, was no clown but a man of feeling after all.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/05/the-man-of-feeling/302486/|title=The Man of Feeling|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|date=2002-05-01|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Olivia Laing]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"Remarkable for its relentless skewering of artifice and pretension, ''Lucky Jim'' also contains some of the finest comic set pieces in the language.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/15/lucky-jim-kingsley-amis-classic|title=Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis {{!}} Classics corner|last=Laing|first=Olivia|date=2010-08-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television adaptations==\nIn the 1957 British [[Lucky Jim (1957 film)|film adaptation]], Jim Dixon was played by [[Ian Carmichael]].

Gang warfare between Hispanic neighborhoods was the norm during the 1950s and 60s, so the fact that Luis Flores was able to get established enemies to set aside their rivalries upon entry into the prison system was something that was not thought possible. This requirement exists to the present day. Hispanic street gangs like [[White Fence]], [[The Avenues (gang)|The Avenues]], Clanton 14, San Fer, [[Barrio Nuevo Estrada]], and the oldest of them, [[Primera Flats]], were already into their second decade and firmly established as self-sustaining entities.<ref name=\"Rafael\">Rafael, T. (2007). ''The Mexican Mafia''. p. 171\u2013185, 237\u2013267. New York: Encounter Books.</ref> \nLuis Flores initially recruited violent members to the gang in an attempt to create a highly feared organization which could control the black market activities of the Deuel prison facilities. La Eme member [[Ramon \"Mundo\" Mendoza]] claims that in the beginning the overall goal was to terrorize the prison system and enjoy prison comforts while doing time. It is said that the name \"Mexican Mafia\" was to show organization similar to the [[American Mafia]] but it was later changed to not be confused with it. Furthermore, the black hand symbol was a reference to the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]] of the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Blatchford\">{{cite book|last1=Blatchford|first1=Chris|title=The black hand : the bloody rise and redemption of \"Boxer\" Enriquez, a Mexican mob killer|date=2008|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=9780061257292|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx_4yIqas64C|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Rise===\nBy 1961, violence was widespread enough at the Deuel Vocational Institution that administrators deemed it necessary to transfer ssa number of the charter La Eme members to [[San Quentin]] Penitentiary in the hopes of discouraging their violent behavior. This tactic failed. [[Rodolfo Cadena|Cheyenne Cadena]] arrived on the lower yard of [[San Quentin]] and was met by a six-foot-five, 300-pound black inmate who kissed him and announced that Cadena\u2019s was his \"bitch.\" Cadena returned a short time later, walked up to the unsuspecting predator, and stabbed him to death with a jailhouse knife, or [[Shiv (weapon)|Shiv]]. There were more than a thousand inmates on the yard and no witnesses stepped forward.<ref name=\"Blatchford\"/>\n\nA string of other slayings soon followed as Mexican Mafia members sought to establish a reputation among the inmates of San Quentin. The Mexican Mafia's quest for complete control alienated many other [[Mexican-American]] inmates who were fed up with Mexican Mafia stabbing, killing, and stealing their watches, rings, cigarettes and anything else of value. Some of them secretly founded a new prison gang called [[Nuestra Familia]] (NF) or \"Our Family.\" It was first established in the mid-1960s at the [[California Correctional Training Facility]] in [[Soledad, California|Soledad]]. Some of the early members were from the Los Angeles area, but NF soon drew inmates primarily from rural communities in Northern California. The Mexican Mafia saw Nuestra Familia as inferior and \"just a bunch of farmers\", or ''farmeros''. However, in 1968 at San Quentin, a full-scale riot broke out after a Mexican Mafia soldier, or ''soldado'', stole a pair of shoes from a Nuestra Familia sympathizer. Nineteen inmates were stabbed and one La Eme associate ended up dead. The battle became known as the \"Shoe War\" and it established Nuestra Familia as the major La Eme rival.<ref name=\"Blatchford\"/><ref name=\"Mcshane\">McShane, M.D., & Williams, F. P. (1996). ''Encyclopedia of American prisons''. (pp. 345\u2013346). Taylor and Francis.</ref>\n\n===New Mexican Mafia===\n\nLa Eme should not be confused with the '''New Mexican Mafia'''. Around 1974, a group of Hispanic inmates at [[Arizona State Prison, Florence]], formed a prison gang known as the Mexican Mafia.<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\">Arizona Department of Corrections. Security Threat Group Unit. (2012). New Mexican Mafia. Retrieved from website: http://www.azcorrections.gov/adc/STG/Jeff_Divisions_Support_STG_nmm.aspx</ref> [[Arizona Department of Corrections]] officials at that time obtained information that this group patterned themselves after the California Mexican Mafia which had been in existence for several years. Several Hispanics who came into the Arizona Prison System brought the concept and philosophy of the California Mexican Mafia.<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\"/> In 1978 the Mexican Mafia split into two organizations. One kept the original philosophy and structure and currently refer to themselves as the Original Mexican Mafia, \"Califas Faction\", \"EME\".<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\"/> The other, which came into prominence in 1984, refer to themselves as the New Mexican Mafia. Many assaults and murders of members of both groups have occurred as a result of each organization claiming the title of \"Mexican Mafia\" within the Arizona prison system. They have created their own rules and regulations and have established an organizational structure.<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\"/> Each member is allowed to vote on issues regarding membership and leadership. The leader, approved by the members, has the power to solely decide important issues.\n\n==Culture==\nLaw enforcement believes that La Eme presently is not presided over by a single leader. Many Mexican Mafia members have the authority to order [[murders]] and oversee various other criminal activities. They have almost a thousand associates that help carry out those orders and have the theoretical control of all Sure\u00f1o gang members.<ref name=\"Supreme Court\"/><ref name=\"Lyman\"/> Members are expected to engage in tests of their loyalty to La Eme, which may include theft or murder. The penalty for refusing orders or failing to complete an assigned task is often death. According to the gang's constitution, members may also be punished or murdered if they commit any of four major infractions.  These include becoming an [[informant]], acts of homosexuality, acts of cowardice, and showing disrespect against fellow gang members. According to gang policy, a member of the Mexican Mafia may not be murdered without prior approval by a [[vote]] of three members, yet the murder of non-members requires no formal approval.\n\nDuring the early 1960s at [[San Quentin Prison]], Luis Flores and Rudy \"Cheyenne\" Cadena established a blood oath for members of the Mexican Mafia.  Prior to the establishment of the oath, members of the Mexican Mafia were allowed to return to their street gangs after incarceration.  The new oath stipulated that the only way for a member to leave the Mexican Mafia was to be killed.  Flores and Cadena also established a set of gang commandments. These included policies such as: a new member must be sponsored by an existing member, unanimous approval from all existing members to join (no longer policy), prioritizing the gang over one's family, denial of the existence of the Mexican Mafia to law enforcement or non-members, respect of other members, and forgiving street conflicts which existed before incarceration.  Execution of a member of the gang for policy violation must be committed by the gang member who sponsored him. La Eme has a blood-in, blood-out credo: Murder or drawing of blood is a prerequisite for membership and anyone trying to get out will be killed.<ref name=\"Abadinsky\"/>\n\n===Rules===\nThe rules of conduct are:\n\n#A member may not be an informant, or rat.\n#A member may not be a coward.\n#A member may not raise a hand against another member without approval.\n#A member must not show disrespect for any member's family, including sex with another member's wife, or girlfriend.\n#A member must not steal from another member.\n#A member may not be homosexual.\n#A member must not politic against another member or cause dissension within the organization.\n#Membership is for life.\n#It's mandatory to assault/kill all dropouts.\n#La Eme comes first. Even before your own family.\n#A member must not interfere with another member's business activities.<ref name=\"Blatchford\"/>\n\n===Allies and rivals===\nThe Mexican Mafia is the controlling organization for almost every Hispanic gang in Southern California, and some gangs located in [[Central California|Central]] and [[Northern California]], with their [[vassal]] gangs being called [[Sure\u00f1os]]. Members of almost all Hispanic gangs in Southern California are obliged under the threat of death to carry out any and all orders from made Mexican Mafia members. The Mexican Mafia also holds a loose alliance with the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], mainly due to their common rivals within the prison system.<ref name=\"Abadinsky\">Abadinsky, H. (2010). Organized crime. (9th ed., p. 189-190).

Bloods and Crips are the new enemies.<ref name=\"Prison Gangs\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nMexican Mafia symbols include images of a black hand. The gang's primary symbol, which is often used in tattoos by members, is the national symbol of Mexico (eagle and a snake) atop a flaming circle over crossed knives. Street gangs that are aligned with the Mexican Mafia often use the number 13 as a gang identifier, as the letter \"M\" is the 13th letter of the modern Latin-derived alphabet.\n\n===In popular culture===\nThe Mexican Mafia received mainstream notoriety after being featured in the 1992 movie ''[[American Me]]''.  The film was co-produced, directed and starred in by actor [[Edward James Olmos]], who allegedly received death threats by members of the Mexican Mafia for what they considered an unflattering depiction of the gang.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite web|url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307346,00.html| title = An 'American' tale|publisher = Entertainment Weekly|date = July 23, 1993}}</ref>  Two consultants for the film were murdered shortly after the film's release, though it is unclear whether the murders were tied to the Mexican Mafia or to recent layoffs that had provoked death threats.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/> The Mexican Mafia was allegedly displeased with the portrayal of the murder of [[Rodolfo Cadena]] (who was the basis for Olmos' character Santana) as being committed by his fellow gang members.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/> Mexican Mafia members were also allegedly offended by the portrayal of homosexual rape committed by Puppet, a Mexican Mafia character in the film who in the latter part of the movie murders his own brother, Li'l Puppet, for disrespecting La Eme.<ref>American Me</ref> Olmos subsequently applied for a concealed handgun permit, which was denied to him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Michael |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307346,00.html |title=EW.com |publisher=EW.com |date=July 23, 1993 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Joe Morgan, while serving a life sentence for murder at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]], filed a $500,000 lawsuit against Olmos, Universal Studios, and other producers of the film.  Morgan claimed that one of the principal characters in the film was based on him without obtaining his permission.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/>\n\n==Criminal activities==\nAccording to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Mexican Mafia had arranged for contract killings to be carried out by the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], a white prison gang. Both the Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood are mutual enemies of the [[Norte\u00f1os]] and the [[African-American]] gangs [[Black Guerrilla Family]] and [[D.C.

His offense: collecting taxes on narcotics dealers without kicking up the profits to Eme leaders behind bars, known in the gang as \"Big Homies\" or Emeros.<ref name=\"Ortega\"/> The person responsible for the murder was [[Joe \"Pegleg\" Morgan]]\u2014the notorious white godfather of La Eme who had ascended by then to become one of the highest-ranking bosses of the entire Eme organization, even with no \"official\" Mexican blood himself.  His connections with cocaine and heroin suppliers in Mexico helped pave the foundation for the Mexican Mafia's narcotics distribution throughout California. During the 1970s, while under the control of Morgan's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] [[Rodolfo Cadena]], the Mexican Mafia often took control over various community groups. The gang was able to filter money from alcohol and drug prevention programs to finance their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Rafael\"/>\n\nThe Mexican Mafia and the Italian-American [[Los Angeles crime family]] collaborated in skimming money from [[Get Going]], a taxpayer-funded drug treatment program. By 1977, Get Going founder Ellen Delia was determined to expose the infiltration of her beloved program. Shortly before an appointment with the California State Secretary of Health and Welfare Services, Delia was murdered. Her collection of evidence on Italian and Mexican Mafia infiltration of the Get Going program was never recovered.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===1980s===\nAlfred Arthur Sandoval a.k.a. Chato (Arizona Maravilla - East Los Angeles, California), a high ranking Eme member, shot and killed Gilbert Martinez and Anthony Aceves; a third victim Manuel Torres survived the attack. Ray and Marlene Wells were also shot execution style in their home in Belvedere Park. Alfred Sandoval was also charged in these murders. Finally in 2000, Alfred Arthur Sandoval, the highest ranking Eme member (now) in California, had his death sentence for the murder of Marlene Wells overturned by the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals but remained imprisoned for life without parole.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1998, United States federal authorities indicted 22 members and associates of the Mexican Mafia, charged under the federal [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] Act with crimes which included extortion, murder, and kidnapping.<ref name=\"The Tech\">{{cite web|url = http://tech.mit.edu/V115/N22/MafiaHanded.22w.html| title = Mafia Handed 22 Indictments in LA|publisher = The Tech|date = May 2, 1995}}</ref> One of the arrested members, Benjamin \"Topo\" Peters (Arizona Maravilla), was allegedly the Mexican Mafia's highest-ranking member at the time, and was engaged in a power struggle with fellow member Ruben \"Tupi\" Hernandez ([[OVS (gang)|OVS- Onterio Varrio Sur - Ontario, California]]).<ref name=\"The Tech\"/> Another indicted member was accused of having plotted the death of an anti-gang activist who served as a consultant for the film ''[[American Me]]''. The indictments marked a two-year investigation by federal, local, and state law enforcement officials.<ref name=\"The Tech\"/>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, a 36-count federal indictment was brought against members of the Mexican Mafia. The arrests were made for alleged acts of violence, drug dealing, and extortion against smaller Latino street gangs. According to the federal indictment, Mexican Mafia members exert their influence in both federal and state prison systems through either violence or the threat of violence. Members and associates of the gang remain fiercely loyal to the criminal organization both in and outside of prison, particularly in Southern California cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego. The gang asserts its influence over Chicano gangs throughout Southern California by threatening violence against their members should they ever become incarcerated. Gangs and drug dealers who refuse to pay a protection \"tax\" to the Mexican Mafia are often murdered or threatened with murder. High-ranking members of the Mexican Mafia who are locked in private cells for 23 hours of each day are still able to communicate with their associates, through methods which range from tapping in code on prison plumbing pipes to smuggled letters. The primary goal of the Mexican Mafia is to control all drug trafficking in all areas that they have been established.<ref name=\"Lyman\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nIn early 2012 there was a federal indictment of 119 San Diego County gang members, including a Mexican Mafia boss that was arrested in a raid of his San Marcos home, portrays a sprawling, well-organized criminal network that ran drug dealing on the streets of North County and even extended inside the Vista jail.<ref name=\"Lowrey\">Lowrey, B.

Furthermore, the black hand symbol was a reference to the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]] of the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Blatchford\">{{cite book|last1=Blatchford|first1=Chris|title=The black hand : the bloody rise and redemption of \"Boxer\" Enriquez, a Mexican mob killer|date=2008|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=9780061257292|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx_4yIqas64C|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Rise===\nBy 1961, violence was widespread enough at the Deuel Vocational Institution that administrators deemed it necessary to transfer ssa number of the charter La Eme members to [[San Quentin]] Penitentiary in the hopes of discouraging their violent behavior. This tactic failed. [[Rodolfo Cadena|Cheyenne Cadena]] arrived on the lower yard of [[San Quentin]] and was met by a six-foot-five, 300-pound black inmate who kissed him and announced that Cadena\u2019s was his \"bitch.\" Cadena returned a short time later, walked up to the unsuspecting predator, and stabbed him to death with a jailhouse knife, or [[Shiv (weapon)|Shiv]]. There were more than a thousand inmates on the yard and no witnesses stepped forward.<ref name=\"Blatchford\"/>\n\nA string of other slayings soon followed as Mexican Mafia members sought to establish a reputation among the inmates of San Quentin. The Mexican Mafia's quest for complete control alienated many other [[Mexican-American]] inmates who were fed up with Mexican Mafia stabbing, killing, and stealing their watches, rings, cigarettes and anything else of value. Some of them secretly founded a new prison gang called [[Nuestra Familia]] (NF) or \"Our Family.\" It was first established in the mid-1960s at the [[California Correctional Training Facility]] in [[Soledad, California|Soledad]]. Some of the early members were from the Los Angeles area, but NF soon drew inmates primarily from rural communities in Northern California. The Mexican Mafia saw Nuestra Familia as inferior and \"just a bunch of farmers\", or ''farmeros''. However, in 1968 at San Quentin, a full-scale riot broke out after a Mexican Mafia soldier, or ''soldado'', stole a pair of shoes from a Nuestra Familia sympathizer. Nineteen inmates were stabbed and one La Eme associate ended up dead. The battle became known as the \"Shoe War\" and it established Nuestra Familia as the major La Eme rival.<ref name=\"Blatchford\"/><ref name=\"Mcshane\">McShane, M.D., & Williams, F. P. (1996). ''Encyclopedia of American prisons''. (pp. 345\u2013346). Taylor and Francis.</ref>\n\n===New Mexican Mafia===\n\nLa Eme should not be confused with the '''New Mexican Mafia'''. Around 1974, a group of Hispanic inmates at [[Arizona State Prison, Florence]], formed a prison gang known as the Mexican Mafia.<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\">Arizona Department of Corrections. Security Threat Group Unit. (2012). New Mexican Mafia. Retrieved from website: http://www.azcorrections.gov/adc/STG/Jeff_Divisions_Support_STG_nmm.aspx</ref> [[Arizona Department of Corrections]] officials at that time obtained information that this group patterned themselves after the California Mexican Mafia which had been in existence for several years. Several Hispanics who came into the Arizona Prison System brought the concept and philosophy of the California Mexican Mafia.<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\"/> In 1978 the Mexican Mafia split into two organizations. One kept the original philosophy and structure and currently refer to themselves as the Original Mexican Mafia, \"Califas Faction\", \"EME\".<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\"/> The other, which came into prominence in 1984, refer to themselves as the New Mexican Mafia. Many assaults and murders of members of both groups have occurred as a result of each organization claiming the title of \"Mexican Mafia\" within the Arizona prison system. They have created their own rules and regulations and have established an organizational structure.<ref name=\"Arizona DOC\"/> Each member is allowed to vote on issues regarding membership and leadership. The leader, approved by the members, has the power to solely decide important issues.\n\n==Culture==\nLaw enforcement believes that La Eme presently is not presided over by a single leader. Many Mexican Mafia members have the authority to order [[murders]] and oversee various other criminal activities. They have almost a thousand associates that help carry out those orders and have the theoretical control of all Sure\u00f1o gang members.<ref name=\"Supreme Court\"/><ref name=\"Lyman\"/> Members are expected to engage in tests of their loyalty to La Eme, which may include theft or murder. The penalty for refusing orders or failing to complete an assigned task is often death. According to the gang's constitution, members may also be punished or murdered if they commit any of four major infractions.  These include becoming an [[informant]], acts of homosexuality, acts of cowardice, and showing disrespect against fellow gang members. According to gang policy, a member of the Mexican Mafia may not be murdered without prior approval by a [[vote]] of three members, yet the murder of non-members requires no formal approval.\n\nDuring the early 1960s at [[San Quentin Prison]], Luis Flores and Rudy \"Cheyenne\" Cadena established a blood oath for members of the Mexican Mafia.  Prior to the establishment of the oath, members of the Mexican Mafia were allowed to return to their street gangs after incarceration.  The new oath stipulated that the only way for a member to leave the Mexican Mafia was to be killed.  Flores and Cadena also established a set of gang commandments. These included policies such as: a new member must be sponsored by an existing member, unanimous approval from all existing members to join (no longer policy), prioritizing the gang over one's family, denial of the existence of the Mexican Mafia to law enforcement or non-members, respect of other members, and forgiving street conflicts which existed before incarceration.  Execution of a member of the gang for policy violation must be committed by the gang member who sponsored him. La Eme has a blood-in, blood-out credo: Murder or drawing of blood is a prerequisite for membership and anyone trying to get out will be killed.<ref name=\"Abadinsky\"/>\n\n===Rules===\nThe rules of conduct are:\n\n#A member may not be an informant, or rat.\n#A member may not be a coward.\n#A member may not raise a hand against another member without approval.\n#A member must not show disrespect for any member's family, including sex with another member's wife, or girlfriend.\n#A member must not steal from another member.\n#A member may not be homosexual.\n#A member must not politic against another member or cause dissension within the organization.\n#Membership is for life.\n#It's mandatory to assault/kill all dropouts.\n#La Eme comes first. Even before your own family.\n#A member must not interfere with another member's business activities.<ref name=\"Blatchford\"/>\n\n===Allies and rivals===\nThe Mexican Mafia is the controlling organization for almost every Hispanic gang in Southern California, and some gangs located in [[Central California|Central]] and [[Northern California]], with their [[vassal]] gangs being called [[Sure\u00f1os]]. Members of almost all Hispanic gangs in Southern California are obliged under the threat of death to carry out any and all orders from made Mexican Mafia members. The Mexican Mafia also holds a loose alliance with the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], mainly due to their common rivals within the prison system.<ref name=\"Abadinsky\">Abadinsky, H. (2010). Organized crime.

Bloods and Crips are the new enemies.<ref name=\"Prison Gangs\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nMexican Mafia symbols include images of a black hand. The gang's primary symbol, which is often used in tattoos by members, is the national symbol of Mexico (eagle and a snake) atop a flaming circle over crossed knives. Street gangs that are aligned with the Mexican Mafia often use the number 13 as a gang identifier, as the letter \"M\" is the 13th letter of the modern Latin-derived alphabet.\n\n===In popular culture===\nThe Mexican Mafia received mainstream notoriety after being featured in the 1992 movie ''[[American Me]]''.  The film was co-produced, directed and starred in by actor [[Edward James Olmos]], who allegedly received death threats by members of the Mexican Mafia for what they considered an unflattering depiction of the gang.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite web|url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307346,00.html| title = An 'American' tale|publisher = Entertainment Weekly|date = July 23, 1993}}</ref>  Two consultants for the film were murdered shortly after the film's release, though it is unclear whether the murders were tied to the Mexican Mafia or to recent layoffs that had provoked death threats.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/> The Mexican Mafia was allegedly displeased with the portrayal of the murder of [[Rodolfo Cadena]] (who was the basis for Olmos' character Santana) as being committed by his fellow gang members.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/> Mexican Mafia members were also allegedly offended by the portrayal of homosexual rape committed by Puppet, a Mexican Mafia character in the film who in the latter part of the movie murders his own brother, Li'l Puppet, for disrespecting La Eme.<ref>American Me</ref> Olmos subsequently applied for a concealed handgun permit, which was denied to him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Michael |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307346,00.html |title=EW.com |publisher=EW.com |date=July 23, 1993 |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> Joe Morgan, while serving a life sentence for murder at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]], filed a $500,000 lawsuit against Olmos, Universal Studios, and other producers of the film.  Morgan claimed that one of the principal characters in the film was based on him without obtaining his permission.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/>\n\n==Criminal activities==\nAccording to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Mexican Mafia had arranged for contract killings to be carried out by the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], a white prison gang.

His offense: collecting taxes on narcotics dealers without kicking up the profits to Eme leaders behind bars, known in the gang as \"Big Homies\" or Emeros.<ref name=\"Ortega\"/> The person responsible for the murder was [[Joe \"Pegleg\" Morgan]]\u2014the notorious white godfather of La Eme who had ascended by then to become one of the highest-ranking bosses of the entire Eme organization, even with no \"official\" Mexican blood himself.  His connections with cocaine and heroin suppliers in Mexico helped pave the foundation for the Mexican Mafia's narcotics distribution throughout California. During the 1970s, while under the control of Morgan's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] [[Rodolfo Cadena]], the Mexican Mafia often took control over various community groups. The gang was able to filter money from alcohol and drug prevention programs to finance their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Rafael\"/>\n\nThe Mexican Mafia and the Italian-American [[Los Angeles crime family]] collaborated in skimming money from [[Get Going]], a taxpayer-funded drug treatment program. By 1977, Get Going founder Ellen Delia was determined to expose the infiltration of her beloved program. Shortly before an appointment with the California State Secretary of Health and Welfare Services, Delia was murdered. Her collection of evidence on Italian and Mexican Mafia infiltration of the Get Going program was never recovered.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===1980s===\nAlfred Arthur Sandoval a.k.a.

The arrests were made for alleged acts of violence, drug dealing, and extortion against smaller Latino street gangs. According to the federal indictment, Mexican Mafia members exert their influence in both federal and state prison systems through either violence or the threat of violence. Members and associates of the gang remain fiercely loyal to the criminal organization both in and outside of prison, particularly in Southern California cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego. The gang asserts its influence over Chicano gangs throughout Southern California by threatening violence against their members should they ever become incarcerated. Gangs and drug dealers who refuse to pay a protection \"tax\" to the Mexican Mafia are often murdered or threatened with murder. High-ranking members of the Mexican Mafia who are locked in private cells for 23 hours of each day are still able to communicate with their associates, through methods which range from tapping in code on prison plumbing pipes to smuggled letters. The primary goal of the Mexican Mafia is to control all drug trafficking in all areas that they have been established.<ref name=\"Lyman\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nIn early 2012 there was a federal indictment of 119 San Diego County gang members, including a Mexican Mafia boss that was arrested in a raid of his San Marcos home, portrays a sprawling, well-organized criminal network that ran drug dealing on the streets of North County and even extended inside the Vista jail.<ref name=\"Lowrey\">Lowrey, B.

It is also featured on his 2005 compilation album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. In the tradition of most of Eminem's follow-up singles, \"The Way I Am\" is one of the songs for which he has sole songwriting credit. It features a much darker and emotionally driven sound than the album's lead single, which was \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe song is a prominent [[hardcore hip-hop]] track for its angst-ridden lyrics and hostile, aggressive delivery by [[Eminem]]. It features the first beat Eminem produced on his own, featuring an ominous bass line, a piano loop, and bell chimes. In the song, Eminem lashes out at people he feels are putting too much pressure on him, including overzealous fans and record executives expecting him to top the success of his hit single \"[[My Name Is]]\", though in fact he went on to do so with \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as well as other songs. He delivers each line extremely aggressively, almost shouting them out, representing the angry, resentful tone taken by the lyrics. The song contains the line \"When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school, and they blame it on Marilyn...\", referring to either [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold]], the bullied perpetrators of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] which took place the previous year, and the resulting media backlash against [[Marilyn Manson]]. The song has also been remixed by [[Danny Lohner]] featuring Marilyn Manson, who has performed the song with Eminem live on stage. The song reached number 8 in the United Kingdom, while in the United States it did not fare as well, not charting on the top 50. In 2005 it was re-released on the album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. \"The Way I Am\" was certified Gold in Sweden, selling over 20,000 copies.<ref name=\"SwedishCert2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/ar-20002.pdf |title=(Guld & Platina) \u00c5R 2000 |publisher=IFPI Sweden |language=Swedish |trans-title=(Gold & Platinum) Year 2000 |pages=8, 10 |format=\"The Way I Am\" at #2131 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304225302/http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/ar-20002.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Eminem released a second autobiography titled ''[[The Way I Am (book)|The Way I Am]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received very positive reviews.

Cynthia Fuchs of [[PopMatters]] was positive: \"In \"The Way I Am,\" Eminem expounds, \"Since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse / And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works / And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve / All this tension, dispensin' these sentences.\" So there it is: he's performing therapy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422004338/http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|title=Eminem: The Marshall Mathers LP - PopMatters Music Review|archivedate=22 April 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] highlighted the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-marshall-mathers-lp-mw0000062949|title=The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> [[Sputnikmusic]] described this song as \"Amityville's portrayal of the Detroit he grew up in; The Way I Am as a whole\".

It is also featured on his 2005 compilation album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. In the tradition of most of Eminem's follow-up singles, \"The Way I Am\" is one of the songs for which he has sole songwriting credit. It features a much darker and emotionally driven sound than the album's lead single, which was \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThe song is a prominent [[hardcore hip-hop]] track for its angst-ridden lyrics and hostile, aggressive delivery by [[Eminem]]. It features the first beat Eminem produced on his own, featuring an ominous bass line, a piano loop, and bell chimes. In the song, Eminem lashes out at people he feels are putting too much pressure on him, including overzealous fans and record executives expecting him to top the success of his hit single \"[[My Name Is]]\", though in fact he went on to do so with \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as well as other songs. He delivers each line extremely aggressively, almost shouting them out, representing the angry, resentful tone taken by the lyrics. The song contains the line \"When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school, and they blame it on Marilyn...\", referring to either [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold]], the bullied perpetrators of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] which took place the previous year, and the resulting media backlash against [[Marilyn Manson]]. The song has also been remixed by [[Danny Lohner]] featuring Marilyn Manson, who has performed the song with Eminem live on stage. The song reached number 8 in the United Kingdom, while in the United States it did not fare as well, not charting on the top 50. In 2005 it was re-released on the album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. \"The Way I Am\" was certified Gold in Sweden, selling over 20,000 copies.<ref name=\"SwedishCert2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/ar-20002.pdf |title=(Guld & Platina) \u00c5R 2000 |publisher=IFPI Sweden |language=Swedish |trans-title=(Gold & Platinum) Year 2000 |pages=8, 10 |format=\"The Way I Am\" at #2131 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304225302/http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/ar-20002.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Eminem released a second autobiography titled ''[[The Way I Am (book)|The Way I Am]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe song received very positive reviews. Aspects lauded were the vocal delivery, rhyme pattern, production and political material covered. Cynthia Fuchs of [[PopMatters]] was positive: \"In \"The Way I Am,\" Eminem expounds, \"Since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse / And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works / And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve / All this tension, dispensin' these sentences.\" So there it is: he's performing therapy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422004338/http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/e/eminem-marshall.shtml|title=Eminem: The Marshall Mathers LP - PopMatters Music Review|archivedate=22 April 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] highlighted the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-marshall-mathers-lp-mw0000062949|title=The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> [[Sputnikmusic]] described this song as \"Amityville's portrayal of the Detroit he grew up in; The Way I Am as a whole\". Same critic listed it in Recommended Downloads and praising the single: \"Built over doomy, gothic arpeggios, rumbling bass, and church bells, Eminem lays down one of the most perfectly formed lyrics of his career, weaving in and out of a tight rhyme scheme that echoes the loping piano motif.

The throbbing, tubular bell and piano laced beat only add to the intensity of the track (incidentally it was crafted by Em himself and it's one of the more stellar examples of his often hit or miss production techniques).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/12/the-marshall-mathers-lp?page=1|title=The Marshall Mathers LP|work=IGN|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani called this song: \"He (Eminem) revels in the fact that there's teen violence in upper-class cities on the epic \"The Way I Am.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/eminem-the-marshall-mathers-lp/63|title=Eminem: The Marshall Mathers LP - Album Review - Slant Magazine|author=Sal Cinquemani|date=16 January 2001|work=Slant Magazine|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> The song was named the 35th Best Song of the decade by the magazine ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://best.complex.com/2000s/Top-100-Songs/the-way-i-am|title=Complex - Style, Music, Sneakers, Entertainment, Girls, Technology|publisher=Best.complex.com|accessdate=2011-08-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205205906/http://best.complex.com/2000s/Top-100-Songs/the-way-i-am|archivedate=2009-12-05}}</ref> The same magazine, in April 2011, ranked the song at #3 on their 100 Best Eminem Songs list.

Other shots show fans coming up to him, asking for his autograph, The scene when EM throws a chair at his Slim Shady LP platinum plaque was inspired by the pressure EM felt by his label to write a hit as the first single for the Marshall Mathers LP. In \u201cThe Way I Am\u201d video, Proof is in the scene when EM is doing a radio interview and flips the DJ off. Also, the little boy who asks for Eminem's photo in the public bathroom is his half-brother, Nathan. as well as Eminem in his neighborhood in front of an old house.
