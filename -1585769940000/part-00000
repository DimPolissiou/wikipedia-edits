Armstrong in the early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family's practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical reading of the [[Book of Proverbs|Biblical Proverb 5:15]] \"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well\", and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast \"on nothing but urine and tap water\".

In 2006, she directed and played one of the leading roles in ''Caramel'', which showcases a Beirut that most people are not familiar with. Rather than tackle political issues that have plagued Lebanon, she presents a comedy that deals with five Lebanese women in Beirut who gather at a beauty salon and deal with issues related to love, sexuality, tradition, disappointment, and everyday ups and downs. The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007, which was a commercial success in the summer of that same year. It sold worldwide and collected important prizes at many festivals around the world, garnering Labaki much acclaim both as a director and actress. It also put her on Variety's 10 Directors to Watch list at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK.

De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK.

Most of his media appearances have been through television specials and guest spots on television programs. His illusions have included the disappearance of a [[Learjet]] (1981), the vanishing and reappearance of the [[Statue of Liberty]] (1983), levitating over the [[Grand Canyon]] (1984), [[Walking Through the Great Wall of China|walking through the Great Wall of China]] (1986), escaping from [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz prison]] (1987), the disappearance of an [[Orient Express]] dining car (1991) and [[David Copperfield's flying illusion|flying on stage]] for several minutes (1992).\n\nOne of his most famous illusions occurred on television on April 8, 1983: A live audience of 20 tourists was seated in front of a giant curtain attached to two lateral scaffoldings built on [[Liberty Island]] in an enclosed viewing area. Copperfield, with help from [[Jim Steinmeyer]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141104010344/http://www.jimsteinmeyer.com/profile/ Biography]. jimsteinmeyer.com</ref> and [[Don Wayne]], raised the curtain before lowering it again a few seconds later to reveal that the space where the Statue of Liberty once stood was empty. A helicopter hovered overhead to give an aerial view of the illusion and the statue appeared to have vanished, with only the circle of lights surrounding it still present and visible. Before making the statue reappear, Copperfield explained in front of the camera why he wanted to perform this illusion. He wanted people to imagine what it would be like if there were no liberty or freedom in the world today and what the world would be like without the freedoms and rights we enjoy. Copperfield then brought the statue back, ending the illusion by saying that \"our ancestors couldn't (enjoy rights and freedoms), we can and our children will\". Both the disappearance and the reappearance of the statue were filmed in [[long take]] to demonstrate the absence of camera tricks.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEsbN5XJOw0 David Copperfield \u2013 Vanishing the Statue of Liberty].

Most of his media appearances have been through television specials and guest spots on television programs.

Copperfield, with help from [[Jim Steinmeyer]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141104010344/http://www.jimsteinmeyer.com/profile/ Biography]. jimsteinmeyer.com</ref> and [[Don Wayne]], raised the curtain before lowering it again a few seconds later to reveal that the space where the Statue of Liberty once stood was empty. A helicopter hovered overhead to give an aerial view of the illusion and the statue appeared to have vanished, with only the circle of lights surrounding it still present and visible. Before making the statue reappear, Copperfield explained in front of the camera why he wanted to perform this illusion. He wanted people to imagine what it would be like if there were no liberty or freedom in the world today and what the world would be like without the freedoms and rights we enjoy. Copperfield then brought the statue back, ending the illusion by saying that \"our ancestors couldn't (enjoy rights and freedoms), we can and our children will\". Both the disappearance and the reappearance of the statue were filmed in [[long take]] to demonstrate the absence of camera tricks.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEsbN5XJOw0 David Copperfield \u2013 Vanishing the Statue of Liberty].
