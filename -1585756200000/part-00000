Gilles died after the accident, while Luc had to stay in the hospital for six months. After many operations, Luc could walk again, although his left leg was 3&nbsp;cm shorter than his right leg, and also weaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewielersite.net/db2/wielersite/coureurmemofiche.php?coureurmemoid=445&coureurid=3455 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801034927/http://www.dewielersite.net/db2/wielersite/coureurmemofiche.php?coureurmemoid=445&coureurid=3455 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-01 |title=Memo Luc Leblanc |language=Dutch }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Leblanc wanted to become a priest, but after a physiotherapist's advice to take up cycling to solve his leg problems, and subsequently [[Raymond Poulidor]]'s advice to become a professional cyclist, he did not become a priest.<ref name=\"wielerheld\">{{cite web|url=http://wielerhelden.blogse.nl/log/luc-leblanc.html|title=Wielerhelden - Luc Leblanc|date=04-01-2006|accessdate=2009-03-13|language=Dutch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218145505/http://wielerhelden.blogse.nl/log/luc-leblanc.html|archivedate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1991 Tour de France]], in the 12th stage Leblanc joined the decisive attack together with [[Charly Mottet]] and [[Pascal Richard]]. Mottet won the stage, but they finished 7&nbsp;minutes ahead of the classification leader [[LeMond]], which meant that Leblanc was the new leader.<ref name=\"McGann\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8mlwItBhhcC&pg=PA200 |pages=199\u2013200|title=The Story of the Tour de France Volume II 1965-2007|author=Bill McGann, Carol McGann|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|year=2008|ISBN=1-59858-608-4}}</ref>\nThe next day, Leblanc finished 12 minutes behind the winner, and lost the lead to [[Miguel Indurain]], who would remain the leader until the end of the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1991.php |language=French |publisher=Memoire du Cyclisme |title=78\u00e8me Tour de France 1991 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131133651/http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1991.php |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[yellow jersey]] that he received for leading the general classification, he gave to Poulidor.<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/> His accident years earlier did lead to operations on his injuries, and in the [[1992 Tour de France]] the effects caught up with him and he had to stop on the stage to Alpe d'Huez. Again, in 1993, his legs hurt, nothing worked, and Luc Leblanc wanted to end his cycling career. However, the last thing he decided to try was to switch to teams and he joined the Festina team.<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/>\n\nThe next year, 1994, was his most successful year. At Festina, Leblanc won the 11th stage of the [[1994 Tour de France]] ahead of Pantani and Indurain, and in the [[1994 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] he won the mountains classification. Later that year he won the [[1994 UCI Road World Championships]].<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/>\n\nAs a world champion, Leblanc had many offers from the world's best cycling teams. He joined Le Groupement, but the team's sponsorship ended one week before the [[1995 Tour de France]]. Leblanc moved on to the Italian team [[Team Polti|Polti]]. Here, needing operations on his leg again, the results were not as expected, although he won one stage at the [[1996 Tour de France]].<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Leblanc was fired by Polti, because Leblanc was injured and could not continue his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article793721.ece/Stakingsleider_stopt_met_tegenzin|title=Stakingsleider stopt met tegenzin|author=Bart Jungmann|publisher=De Volkskrant|language=Dutch|date=4 March 1999}}</ref> Later, the Italian court decided that the dismissal was unfair, and Polti should pay Leblanc.

professional [[cycling|cyclist]]. In 1994 he was the [[World Cycling Championship|World Road Champion]].\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1978, a drunk driver hit Luc Leblanc, aged 11, and his younger brother Gilles Leblanc, aged 8. Gilles died after the accident, while Luc had to stay in the hospital for six months. After many operations, Luc could walk again, although his left leg was 3&nbsp;cm shorter than his right leg, and also weaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dewielersite.net/db2/wielersite/coureurmemofiche.php?coureurmemoid=445&coureurid=3455 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801034927/http://www.dewielersite.net/db2/wielersite/coureurmemofiche.php?coureurmemoid=445&coureurid=3455 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-01 |title=Memo Luc Leblanc |language=Dutch }}</ref>\n\nInitially, Leblanc wanted to become a priest, but after a physiotherapist's advice to take up cycling to solve his leg problems, and subsequently [[Raymond Poulidor]]'s advice to become a professional cyclist, he did not become a priest.<ref name=\"wielerheld\">{{cite web|url=http://wielerhelden.blogse.nl/log/luc-leblanc.html|title=Wielerhelden - Luc Leblanc|date=04-01-2006|accessdate=2009-03-13|language=Dutch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218145505/http://wielerhelden.blogse.nl/log/luc-leblanc.html|archivedate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1991 Tour de France]], in the 12th stage Leblanc joined the decisive attack together with [[Charly Mottet]] and [[Pascal Richard]]. Mottet won the stage, but they finished 7&nbsp;minutes ahead of the classification leader [[LeMond]], which meant that Leblanc was the new leader.<ref name=\"McGann\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8mlwItBhhcC&pg=PA200 |pages=199\u2013200|title=The Story of the Tour de France Volume II 1965-2007|author=Bill McGann, Carol McGann|publisher=Dog Ear Publishing|year=2008|ISBN=1-59858-608-4}}</ref>\nThe next day, Leblanc finished 12 minutes behind the winner, and lost the lead to [[Miguel Indurain]], who would remain the leader until the end of the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1991.php |language=French |publisher=Memoire du Cyclisme |title=78\u00e8me Tour de France 1991 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131133651/http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1991.php |archivedate=2009-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[yellow jersey]] that he received for leading the general classification, he gave to Poulidor.<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/> His accident years earlier did lead to operations on his injuries, and in the [[1992 Tour de France]] the effects caught up with him and he had to stop on the stage to Alpe d'Huez. Again, in 1993, his legs hurt, nothing worked, and Luc Leblanc wanted to end his cycling career. However, the last thing he decided to try was to switch to teams and he joined the Festina team.<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/>\n\nThe next year, 1994, was his most successful year. At Festina, Leblanc won the 11th stage of the [[1994 Tour de France]] ahead of Pantani and Indurain, and in the [[1994 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] he won the mountains classification. Later that year he won the [[1994 UCI Road World Championships]].<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/>\n\nAs a world champion, Leblanc had many offers from the world's best cycling teams. He joined Le Groupement, but the team's sponsorship ended one week before the [[1995 Tour de France]]. Leblanc moved on to the Italian team [[Team Polti|Polti]]. Here, needing operations on his leg again, the results were not as expected, although he won one stage at the [[1996 Tour de France]].<ref name=\"wielerheld\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Leblanc was fired by Polti, because Leblanc was injured and could not continue his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article793721.ece/Stakingsleider_stopt_met_tegenzin|title=Stakingsleider stopt met tegenzin|author=Bart Jungmann|publisher=De Volkskrant|language=Dutch|date=4 March 1999}}</ref> Later, the Italian court decided that the dismissal was unfair, and Polti should pay Leblanc. In 2007, Leblanc sued the French and Italian cycling authorities and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] because he still had not gotten the money.<ref>{{cite
