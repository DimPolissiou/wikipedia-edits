She is known for her role as [[Macy Alexander]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (1989\u20132000, 2001, 2002\u20132003) and for her role as [[Krystal Carey Chandler|Krystal Carey]] on ''[[All My Children]]'' (2003\u20132011).\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Personal life ===\nShe is the youngest of five daughters in an Air Force family.<ref>[http://www.bobbieeakes.com/biography.htm Bobbie Eakes Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509092745/http://www.bobbieeakes.com/biography.htm |date=May 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nEakes was [[Miss Georgia (U.S. state)|Miss Georgia]] 1982, placing among the top 10 at [[Miss America 1983]]. She studied at the [[University of Georgia]]. In 1992 she married novelist and actor David Steen on July 4. She has no children. Her sisters are Susan, Sharon, Shelly, and Sandra. Eakes shares a birthday with Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke Logan Forrester on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'').\n\n===Career===\nEakes received bit roles on nighttime television series, such as ''[[Cheers]]'', before becoming successful in the soap opera genre. In the mid-1980s, she was the lead singer of the dance-pop rock group [[Big Trouble (band)|Big Trouble]]. The group released one [[Big Trouble (Big Trouble album)|self-titled]] CD in 1987, which was produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]].<ref>[http://www.giorgio-moroder-disco.com/moroderlp1986-1990.html Giorgio Moroder discography, 1986-1990] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406000947/http://www.giorgio-moroder-disco.com/moroderlp1986-1990.html |date=April 6, 2010 }}</ref> Their single \"[[Crazy World (Big Trouble song)|Crazy World]]\" charted on the U.S. singles chart, reaching #71. As a result, Big Trouble became short-lived one-hit wonders.\n\nShe first achieved fame in the role of [[Macy Alexander]] on the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', which she played from 1989 to 2000 (on contract), 2001 (guest appearance) and 2002 to 2003 (on contract). A very popular \"good girl\" kind of character, Macy battled with her inner demons (including an addiction to [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]) before finally finding happiness with [[Deacon Sharpe]] (played by [[Sean Kanan]]). On the show, Macy was an accomplished singer in her own right (in tune with Bobbie Eakes' hobby).\n\nBetween stints as Macy, Eakes hosted shows on the country music television channel [[Great American Country]]. She was also featured on country music singer [[Collin Raye]]'s 2000 single \"Tired of Loving This Way\", which peaked at #50 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.\n\nOn July 7, 2000, her character \"died\" in a fiery explosion when her car crashed into a gasoline truck when the writers of the show felt the character of Macy no longer contributed to the show's storyline. She was brought back to the show during the ''B&B'' location shoot at [[Portofino]], Italy in December 2002, and was then killed off after a chandelier fell on her during a concert in 2003. The decision was made to kill Macy off a second time after Eakes had decided to take the role of [[Krystal Carey]] on ''[[All My Children]]'', as the complete opposite of Macy, playing the sexy and sassy character. The role of Krystal is loosely based on Eakes' [[Southern United States|Southern]] upbringing.\n\nEakes also starred in productions of ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' opposite her former costar [[Jeff Trachta]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The two are still friends offscreen. The CD they recorded together, ''Bold and Beautiful Duets'', went double-platinum in Europe.\n\nWith ''All My Children'' airing its final episode on ABC in September 2011, earlier in June it was highly rumored that Bobbie Eakes would be returning to ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. She also starred as Katherine \"Kitty\" on ''The Grove: The Series'' created by [[Crystal Chappell]] and in 12 episodes of ''[[Tainted Dreams]]''. Both were released exclusively online.\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Televisionn\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Film\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|1986||''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' || Joanne Leigh ||1 episode&nbsp;\u2013 as Bobbi Eakes\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1987||''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''||April Blue||Rowspan=3|1 episode\n|-\n|''[[Falcon Crest]]'' ||Dating Girl\n|-\n|''[[Werewolf (TV series)|Werewolf]]''||Margaret\n|-\n|1988||''[[Cheers]]'' || Laurie Drake ||1 episode (season 6, episode 15: ''Tale of Two Cuties'')\n|-\n|1989||''[[The Wonder Years]]'' ||Bookstore Clerk ||2 episodes\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1989||''[[Full House]]'' ||Diane ||1 episode\n|-\n|''[[21 Jump Street]]'' || Bobbie ||1 episode\n|-\n|''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' ||[[Macy Alexander]]||Role from: April 27, 1989&nbsp;\u2013 July 30, 2000; August 1\u20132, 2001; December 2002&nbsp;\u2013 October 2003\n|-\n|1995||''[[Land's End]]'' ||Stephanie Wade ||1 episode\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2001||''[[Doc (2001 TV series)|Doc]]''|| Molly Campbell ||1 episode\n|-\n| ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' || Annabel Hart ||1 episode\n|-\n| ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' ||Marchioness of La Cienega||1 episode\n|-\n|2003\u20132011 || ''[[All My Children]]'' ||[[Krystal Carey]]|| December 12, 2003&nbsp;\u2013 September 23, 2011\n|-\n|2004\u20132005||''[[One Life to Live]]'' ||Krystal Carey || November 12\u201319, 2004; February 17\u201321, 2005\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2004|| ''[[Hope & Faith]]'' || Herself || 2 episodes\n|-\n| ''[[The Division]]'' || Ms. Emberly || 1 episode\n|-\n|2008||''[[Sordid Lives: The Series]]'' ||Daniella || 2 episodes\n|-\n|2011||''Who Is Billie Mackenzie?'' || Mrs. Mackenzie || 1 episode\n|-\n|2012||''Fumbling Thru the Pieces'' || Crystal || 3 episodes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Film\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|1994||''A Gift from Heaven''||Unknown||\n|-\n|2001||''Choosing Matthias''||Kay ||\n|-\n|2003||''Charlie's War'' || Caroline Lewis||\n|-\n|2011||''A Christmas Wedding Tale''||Hillary||TV movie\n|-\n|2013||''Sunny and RayRay''||Abilene||\n|-\n|2013||''[[Southern Baptist Sissies]]''||Mark's mother||\n|-\n|2015||''The Diamond in the Desert''||Newscaster||Short\n|-\n|2017||''Distortion''||Pam Walters\n|-\n|TBC||''The Bellmen''||Catherine||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Web\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|2013||''The Grove''||Katherine||Pilot\n|-\n|2014\u20132017||''[[Tainted Dreams]]''||Courtney Parish||12 episodes: January 4, 2014; December 25, 2016; December 28, 2017\n|}\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Big Trouble (Big Trouble album)|Big Trouble]]''<br />{{small|(with [[Big Trouble (band)|Big Trouble]])}}\n|\n* Release date: 1988\n* Label: [[Epic Records|Epic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Bold and Beautiful Duets''<br />{{small|(with [[Jeff Trachta]])}}\n|\n* Release date: 1994\n* Label: Arcade\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Here and Now''\n|\n* Release date: 1998\n* Label: CNR\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Something Beautiful''\n|\n* Release date: April 26, 2005\n* Label: Brentwood Records\n|}\n\n===Guest singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Single\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Artist\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Tired of Loving This Way\"\n| [[Collin Raye]]\n| 50\n| 76\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| ''[[Tracks (Collin Raye album)|Tracks]]''\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

She is known for her role as [[Macy Alexander]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (1989\u20132000, 2001, 2002\u20132003) and for her role as [[Krystal Carey Chandler|Krystal Carey]] on ''[[All My Children]]'' (2003\u20132011).\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Personal life ===\nShe is the youngest of five daughters in an Air Force family.<ref>[http://www.bobbieeakes.com/biography.htm Bobbie Eakes Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509092745/http://www.bobbieeakes.com/biography.htm |date=May 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nEakes was [[Miss Georgia (U.S. state)|Miss Georgia]] 1982, placing among the top 10 at [[Miss America 1983]]. She studied at the [[University of Georgia]]. In 1992 she married novelist and actor David Steen on July 4. She has no children. Her sisters are Susan, Sharon, Shelly, and Sandra. Eakes shares a birthday with Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke Logan Forrester on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'').\n\n===Career===\nEakes received bit roles on nighttime television series, such as ''[[Cheers]]'', before becoming successful in the soap opera genre. In the mid-1980s, she was the lead singer of the dance-pop rock group [[Big Trouble (band)|Big Trouble]]. The group released one [[Big Trouble (Big Trouble album)|self-titled]] CD in 1987, which was produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]].<ref>[http://www.giorgio-moroder-disco.com/moroderlp1986-1990.html Giorgio Moroder discography, 1986-1990] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406000947/http://www.giorgio-moroder-disco.com/moroderlp1986-1990.html |date=April 6, 2010 }}</ref> Their single \"[[Crazy World (Big Trouble song)|Crazy World]]\" charted on the U.S. singles chart, reaching #71. As a result, Big Trouble became short-lived one-hit wonders.\n\nShe first achieved fame in the role of [[Macy Alexander]] on the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', which she played from 1989 to 2000 (on contract), 2001 (guest appearance) and 2002 to 2003 (on contract). A very popular \"good girl\" kind of character, Macy battled with her inner demons (including an addiction to [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]) before finally finding happiness with [[Deacon Sharpe]] (played by [[Sean Kanan]]. On the show, Macy was an accomplished singer in her own right (in tune with Bobbie Eakes' hobby).\n\nBetween stints as Macy, Eakes hosted shows on the country music television channel [[Great American Country]]. She was also featured on country music singer [[Collin Raye]]'s 2000 single \"Tired of Loving This Way\", which peaked at #50 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.\n\nOn July 7, 2000, her character \"died\" in a fiery explosion when her car crashed into a gasoline truck when the writers of the show felt the character of Macy no longer contributed to the show's storyline. She was brought back to the show during the ''B&B'' location shoot at [[Portofino]], Italy in December 2002, and was then killed off after a chandelier fell on her during a concert in 2003. The decision was made to kill Macy off a second time after Eakes had decided to take the role of [[Krystal Carey]] on ''[[All My Children]]'', as the complete opposite of Macy, playing the sexy and sassy character. The role of Krystal is loosely based on Eakes' [[Southern United States|Southern]] upbringing.\n\nEakes also starred in productions of ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' opposite her former costar [[Jeff Trachta]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The two are still friends offscreen. The CD they recorded together, ''Bold and Beautiful Duets'', went double-platinum in Europe.\n\nWith ''All My Children'' airing its final episode on ABC in September 2011, earlier in June it was highly rumored that Bobbie Eakes would be returning to ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. She also starred as Katherine \"Kitty\" on ''The Grove: The Series'' created by [[Crystal Chappell]] and in 12 episodes of ''[[Tainted Dreams]]''. Both were released exclusively online.\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Televisionn\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Film\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|1986||''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' || Joanne Leigh ||1 episode&nbsp;\u2013 as Bobbi Eakes\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1987||''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''||April Blue||Rowspan=3|1 episode\n|-\n|''[[Falcon Crest]]'' ||Dating Girl\n|-\n|''[[Werewolf (TV series)|Werewolf]]''||Margaret\n|-\n|1988||''[[Cheers]]'' || Laurie Drake ||1 episode (season 6, episode 15: ''Tale of Two Cuties'')\n|-\n|1989||''[[The Wonder Years]]'' ||Bookstore Clerk ||2 episodes\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1989||''[[Full House]]'' ||Diane ||1 episode\n|-\n|''[[21 Jump Street]]'' || Bobbie ||1 episode\n|-\n|''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' ||[[Macy Alexander]]||Role from: April 27, 1989&nbsp;\u2013 July 30, 2000; August 1\u20132, 2001; December 2002&nbsp;\u2013 October 2003\n|-\n|1995||''[[Land's End]]'' ||Stephanie Wade ||1 episode\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2001||''[[Doc (2001 TV series)|Doc]]''|| Molly Campbell ||1 episode\n|-\n| ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' || Annabel Hart ||1 episode\n|-\n| ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' ||Marchioness of La Cienega||1 episode\n|-\n|2003\u20132011 || ''[[All My Children]]'' ||[[Krystal Carey]]|| December 12, 2003&nbsp;\u2013 September 23, 2011\n|-\n|2004\u20132005||''[[One Life to Live]]'' ||Krystal Carey || November 12\u201319, 2004; February 17\u201321, 2005\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2004|| ''[[Hope & Faith]]'' || Herself || 2 episodes\n|-\n| ''[[The Division]]'' || Ms. Emberly || 1 episode\n|-\n|2008||''[[Sordid Lives: The Series]]'' ||Daniella || 2 episodes\n|-\n|2011||''Who Is Billie Mackenzie?'' || Mrs. Mackenzie || 1 episode\n|-\n|2012||''Fumbling Thru the Pieces'' || Crystal || 3 episodes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Film\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|1994||''A Gift from Heaven''||Unknown||\n|-\n|2001||''Choosing Matthias''||Kay ||\n|-\n|2003||''Charlie's War'' || Caroline Lewis||\n|-\n|2011||''A Christmas Wedding Tale''||Hillary||TV movie\n|-\n|2013||''Sunny and RayRay''||Abilene||\n|-\n|2013||''[[Southern Baptist Sissies]]''||Mark's mother||\n|-\n|2015||''The Diamond in the Desert''||Newscaster||Short\n|-\n|2017||''Distortion''||Pam Walters\n|-\n|TBC||''The Bellmen''||Catherine||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Web\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Role\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|2013||''The Grove''||Katherine||Pilot\n|-\n|2014\u20132017||''[[Tainted Dreams]]''||Courtney Parish||12 episodes: January 4, 2014; December 25, 2016; December 28, 2017\n|}\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Big Trouble (Big Trouble album)|Big Trouble]]''<br />{{small|(with [[Big Trouble (band)|Big Trouble]])}}\n|\n* Release date: 1988\n* Label: [[Epic Records|Epic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Bold and Beautiful Duets''<br />{{small|(with [[Jeff Trachta]])}}\n|\n* Release date: 1994\n* Label: Arcade\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Here and Now''\n|\n* Release date: 1998\n* Label: CNR\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Something Beautiful''\n|\n* Release date: April 26, 2005\n* Label: Brentwood Records\n|}\n\n===Guest singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Single\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Artist\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Tired of Loving This Way\"\n| [[Collin Raye]]\n| 50\n| 76\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| ''[[Tracks (Collin Raye album)|Tracks]]''\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
