On 26 February, following outbreaks [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy|in Italy]] and [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran|in Iran]], multiple travel-related clusters appeared in Sweden. [[Transmission (medicine)#Definition and related terms|Community transmission]] was confirmed on 9 March in the [[Stockholm Regional Council|Stockholm region]].

A typical swarm can be made up of 150 million locusts per square kilometer and is carried on the wind, up to 150 km in one day.\u00a0 Even a very small, one-square-kilometer locust swarm can eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35 000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/africa/news/detail-news/en/c/1260476/|title=FAO and partners stress urgent need on Desert Locust Response|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref> \n\nIt is an international [[Food and Agriculture Organization#Transboundary pests and diseases|transboundary pest]] which threatens [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and livelihoods in many countries in [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and south and southwestern [[Asia]]. Its migratory nature and capacity for rapid population growth present major challenges for control, particularly in remote semiarid areas, which characterize much of the distribution area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/publicat/docs/tech/1290/index.html|title=No. 27: Economic and policy issues in Desert Locust management (S.

Periods of low and intermediate numbers and densities (recessions, outbreaks and upsurges) alternate with very high numbers and densities (plagues). The desert locust risk increases during the one-to-two-year continuum of favourable weather and habitats that support population increases during upsurges and plagues. When that happens, the desert locust becomes one of the most internationally known and important insect pests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dlco-ea.org/final/index.php/component/content/article/82-blog/informations/89-desert-locust-on-acacia|title=Desert Locust|last=DLCEO-EA|first=|date=|website=dlco-ea.org|language=en-gb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\nThe desert locust is potentially the most dangerous of the [[locust]] pests because of the ability of [[swarm]]s to fly rapidly across great distances. It has two to five generations per year. The [[#2003\u20132005 desert locust upsurge (West Africa)|major desert locust upsurge in 2004\u201305]] caused significant [[agriculture|crop]] losses in [[West Africa]] and diminished [[food security]] in the region. \n\nIn February 2020, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation announced that desert locusts are destroying tens of thousands of hectares of crops and grazing land in North East Africa in the worst invasion in 25 years. The UN warns that a dangerous situation is now facing the region and in particular eastern [[Ethiopia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/africa/news/detail-news/en/c/1260476/|title=FAO and partners stress urgent need on Desert Locust Response|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref> Since this announcement, swarms have caused [[Somalia]] to declare a state of emergency<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51348517|title=Somalia declares emergency over locust swarms|date=2020-02-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-02-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> and spread to other [[East Africa|East African]] countries like [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/pictures-desert-locusts-swarm-parts-east-africa-200218110404380.html|title=In Pictures: Desert locusts swarm parts of East Africa|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> and most recently South Sudan<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51547573|title=Locust swarms: South Sudan latest to be hit by invasion|website=www.bbc.com|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>.  \n[[File:A swarm of locusts (cleaned) - Emil Schmidt.jpg|border|thumb|\u201eSchwarm der Wanderheuschrecke\u201c, Chromolithographie nach Emil Schmidt (Brehm, A.E., 1882\u20131884, Bd. 9: 551)]]\n\n==Life cycle==\n[[File:Schistocerca gregaria 01.jpg|thumb|right|Desert locusts preparatory to mating, London Zoo]]\nThe life cycle of the desert locust consists of three stages, the egg, the [[nymph (biology)|nymph]] known as a hopper, and the winged adult. Copulation takes place when a mature male hops onto the back of a mature female and grips her body with his legs. Sperm is transferred from the tip of his abdomen to the tip of hers, where it is stored. The process takes several hours and one insemination is sufficient for a number of batches of eggs.<ref name=Handbook>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzdl.org/gsdlmod?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-10-0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-00&a=d&c=hdl&cl=CL1.10&d=HASHd1edbf77fbe3fa2e5e3da5.4.2 |title=Desert locust: Life cycle |work=Locust Handbook |publisher=Humanity Development Library |accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe female then seeks suitable soft soil in which to lay her eggs. It needs to be the right temperature and degree of dampness and be in close proximity to other egg-laying females. She probes the soil with her abdomen and digs a hole into which an eggpod containing up to a hundred eggs is deposited. The egg pod is {{convert|3|to|4|cm|1|abbr=on}} long and the lower end is about {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} below the surface of the ground. The eggs are surrounded by foam and this hardens into a membrane and plugs the hole above the egg pod. The eggs absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The incubation period before the eggs hatch may be two weeks or much longer, depending on the temperature.<ref name=Handbook/>\n\n[[File:S. gregaria dense hopper band.jpg|thumb|left|Dense hopper band in [[Sudan]]]]\nThe newly hatched nymph soon begins to feed and, if it is a gregarious individual, is attracted to other hoppers and they group together. As it grows it needs to [[moulting|moult]] (shed its [[exoskeleton]]). Its hard cuticle splits and its body expands while the new exoskeleton is still soft. The stages between moulting are called [[instar]]s and the desert locust nymph undergoes five moults before becoming a winged adult. Immature and mature individuals in the gregarious phase form bands which feed, bask and move as cohesive units, while solitary phase individuals do not seek gregariousness.<ref name=Handbook/><ref name=\"Simpson1999\"/>\n\nAfter the fifth moult the insect is said to have fledged but it is not yet mature. It is at first soft and pink with drooping wings, but over the course of a few days, the cuticle hardens and  [[Hemolymph|haemolymph]] is pumped into the wings which stiffen them. Maturation can occur in two to four weeks when the food supply and weather conditions are suitable, but may take as long as six months when they are less ideal. Males start maturing first and give off an odour which stimulates maturation in the females. On maturing the insects turn yellow and the abdomens of the females start swelling with developing eggs.<ref name=Handbook/>\n\n==Ecology and swarming==\n[[File:DesertLocust.jpeg|thumb|left|Solitary (top) and gregarious (bottom) desert locust nymphs]]\nDesert locusts have two phases, the solitary phase and the gregarious phase. This is a type of [[polyphenism]]. It has been shown that solitary locusts nymphs and adults can behave gregariously within a few hours of being placed in a crowded situation, while it takes gregarious locusts one or more generations to become solitary when reared in isolation.<ref name=\"Simpson1999\">{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=S.J.|last2=McCaffery|first2=A.R.|last3=Hagele|first3=B.F.|year=1999|title=A behavioural analysis of phase change in thedesert locust|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=74|issue=4|pages=461\u2013480|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1999.tb00038.x}}</ref> There are differences in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and behaviour between the two phases. In the solitary phase the hoppers do not group together into bands but move about independently. Their colouring in the later instars tends to be greenish or brownish to match the colour of the herbage. The adults fly at night and are also coloured so as to blend into their surroundings, the immature adults being grey or beige and the mature adults being a pale yellowish colour. In the gregarious phase the hoppers bunch together and in the later instars develop a bold colouring with black markings on a yellow background. The immatures are pink and the mature adults are bright yellow and fly during the day in dense swarms.<ref name=Handbook/>\n\nThe change from an innocuous solitary insect to a voracious gregarious one normally follows a period of drought, when rain falls and vegetation flushes occur in major desert locust breeding locations. The population builds up rapidly and the competition for food increases.<ref name=Showler>{{cite web |url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/showler.htm |title=The Desert Locust in Africa and Western Asia: Complexities of War, Politics, Perilous Terrain, and Development |author=Showler, Allan T. |date=2013-03-04 |work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2015-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408034918/http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/showler.htm |archivedate=2015-04-08 }}</ref> As hoppers get more crowded, the close physical contact causes the insects' hind legs to bump against one another. This [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] triggers a cascade of [[metabolic]] and behavioral changes that cause the insects to transform from the [[statary|solitary]] to the gregarious phase. When the hoppers become gregarious, their colouration changes from largely green to yellow and black, and the adults change from brown to pink (immature) or yellow (mature). Their bodies become shorter, and they give off a [[pheromone]] that causes them to be attracted to each other, enhancing hopper band and subsequently [[swarm]] formation. The nymphal pheromone is different from the adult one. When exposed to the adult pheromone, hoppers become confused and disoriented, because they can apparently no longer \"smell\" each other, though the visual and tactile stimuli remain. After a few days, the hopper bands disintegrate and those that escape predation become solitary again. It is possible that this effect could aid locust control in the future.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nDuring quiet periods, called recessions, desert locusts are confined to a 16-million-square-kilometer belt that extends from [[Mauritania]] through the [[Sahara Desert]] in [[northern Africa]], across the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and into northwest [[India]]. Under optimal ecological and climatic conditions, several successive generations can occur, causing swarms to form and invade countries on all sides of the recession area, as far north as [[Spain]] and [[Russia]], as far south as [[Nigeria]] and [[Kenya]], and as far east as [[India]] and southwest [[Asia]]. As many as 60 countries can be affected within an area of 32 million square kilometers, or approximately 20 percent of the Earth's land surface.\n\n[[File:Desert.locust.arp.jpg|thumb|Close-up]]\nLocust swarms fly with the wind at roughly the speed of the wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 kilometers in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (it becomes too cold at higher altitudes). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], the [[Hindu Kush]] or the [[Himalayas]]. They will not venture into the [[rain forest]]s of Africa nor into central Europe.

In the 1920s-1930s, locust control became a major field for international cooperation. The International Agricultural Institute developed several programmes aimed at exchanging data about the desert locust and international conferences were held in the 1930s: [[Rome]] in 1931, [[Paris]] in 1932, [[London]] in 1934, [[Cairo]] in 1936 and [[Brussels]] in 1938. Colonial empires were heavily involved in these attempts to control locust pests which affected heavily the Middle East and parts of Africa.<ref>Antonio Buj, \u00ab International Experimentations and Control of the Locust Plague \u2013 Africa in the First Half of the 20th Century \u00bb, in Yvon Chatelin, Christophe Bonneuil (eds.), Les sciences hors d\u2019Occident au XXe si\u00e8cle, Vol. 3 : Nature et environment, Paris, Orstom Editions, 1995, pp. 93-105.</ref> The USSR also used locust control as a way to expand its influence in the Middle East and Central Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ge/2014/00000007/00000002/art00011?crawler=true|title=Fighting Locusts Together: Pest Control and the Birth of Soviet Development Aid, 1920-1939|first=Etienne|last=Forestier-Peyrat|date=October 25, 2014|website=www.ingentaconnect.com}}</ref>\n\n[[FAO]]'s [http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS)] in Rome, Italy monitors the weather, ecological conditions and the locust situation on a daily basis. DLIS receives results of survey and control operations carried out by national teams in affected countries, and combines this information with [[satellite]] data such as [[MODIS]], rainfall estimates and seasonal temperature and rainfall predictions to assess the current situation and forecast the timing, scale and location of breeding and migration up to six weeks in advance. The situation assessments and forecasts are published in monthly locust bulletins that date back to the 1970s. These are supplemented by warnings and alerts to affected countries and the international community. Those since the 1990s are available on the [http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts FAO Locust Watch web site]. FAO also provides information and training to affected countries and coordinates funding from donor agencies in case of major upsurges and plagues.\n\nThe desert locust is a difficult pest to control, and control measures are further compounded by the large and often remote areas (16-30 million km\u00b2) where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic [[infrastructure]] in some affected countries, limited resources for locust monitoring and control, and political turmoil within and between affected countries further reduce the capacity of a country to undertake the necessary monitoring and control activities.\n\nAt present, the primary method of controlling desert locust infestations is with [[insecticides]] applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers at [[ultra-low volume]] (ULV) rates of application. The insecticide is acquired by the insect directly or via secondary pickup (i.e. walking over or eating the residue on a plant). Control is undertaken by [[government]] agencies in locust-affected countries or by specialized organizations such as the [http://dlco-ea.org/ Desert Locust Control Organization for East Africa (DLCO-EA)].\n\nThe desert locust has natural enemies such as predatory wasps and flies, [[parasitoid wasp]]s, predatory beetle larvae, [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s. These may be effective at keeping solitary populations in check but are of limited effects against gregarious desert locusts because of the enormous numbers of insects in the swarms and hopper bands.<ref name=Showler/>\n\nFarmers often try mechanical means of killing locusts, such as digging trenches and burying hopper bands, but this is very labour-intensive and is difficult to undertake when large infestations are scattered over a wide area. Farmers also try to scare locust swarms away from their fields by making noise, burning tires or other methods. This tends to shift the problem to neighbouring farms, and locust swarms can easily return to reinfest previously visited fields.\n\n==Biopesticides==\n[[Biological insecticide|Biopesticides]] include fungi, bacteria, [[neem]] extract and pheromones. The effectiveness of many biopesticides equals that of conventional chemical pesticides, but there are two distinct differences. Biopesticides in general take longer to kill insects, plant diseases, or weeds, usually between 2 and 10 days.\n\nThere are two types of biopesticides - biochemical and microbial. Biochemical pesticides are similar to naturally occurring chemicals and are nontoxic, such as insect pheromones used to locate mates, while microbial biopesticides, come from bacteria, fungi, algae or viruses that either occur naturally or are genetically altered. [[Entomopathogenic fungi]] generally suppress pests by mycosis: causing a disease that is specific to the insect.\n\n[[Biological control]] products have been under development since the late nineties; [[LUBILOSA#Commercialisation|Green Muscle]] and [[LUBILOSA#Post-LUBILOSA|NOVACRID]] are based on a naturally occurring [[entomopathogenic fungus]] (i.e. insects-infecting fungus), ''[[Metarhizium acridum]]''. Species of ''Metarhizium'' are widespread throughout the world, infecting many groups of insects, but show a low risk to humans, other [[mammal]]s and birds. The species ''M. acridum'' has specialised on short-horned [[caelifera|grasshopper]]s, to which group locusts belong, and has therefore been chosen as the active ingredient of the product.\n\nThe product is available in Australia under the name Green Guard and in Africa, it used to be available as Green Muscle. However, since Green Muscle seems to have disappeared from the market, another product, NOVACRID, was developed for Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. These products are applied in the same way as chemical insecticides, but do not kill as quickly. At recommended doses, the fungus can take up two weeks to kill up to 90% of the locusts. For that reason, it is recommended for use mainly against hoppers, the wingless early stages of locusts. These are mostly found in the desert, far from cropping areas, where the delay in death does not result in damage. The advantage of the product is that it affects only grasshoppers and locusts, which makes it much safer than chemical insecticides. Specifically, it allows the natural enemies of locusts and grasshoppers to continue their beneficial work. These include birds, [[parasitoid]] and [[predator]]y [[wasp]]s, parasitoid [[fly|flies]] and certain species of [[beetle]]s. Though natural enemies cannot prevent plagues, they can limit the frequency of outbreaks and contribute to their control. Biopesticides are also safer to use in environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks or near rivers and other water bodies.\n\nGreen Muscle was developed under the [[LUBILOSA]] Programme, which was initiated in 1989 in response to environmental concerns over the heavy use of chemical insecticides to control locusts and grasshoppers during the 1987-89 plague. The project focused on the use of beneficial disease-causing [[microorganism]]s ([[pathogen]]s) as biological control agents for grasshoppers and locusts. These insects were considered to be too mobile and to reproduce too fast to be readily controlled by classical biological control. Pathogens have the advantage that many can be produced in artificial culture in large quantities and be used with ordinary spraying equipment. Entomopathogenic fungi were traditionally seen as needing humid conditions to work well. However, the LUBILOSA Programme found a way to avoid this by [[pesticide application|spraying]] fungal spores in an oil [[pesticide formulation|formulation]]. Even under desert conditions, Green Muscle can be used to kill locusts and other [[Acrididae|Acridid]] pests, such as the [[Senegalese grasshopper]]. During trials in Algeria and Mauritania in 2005 and 2006, various natural enemies, but especially birds, were abundant enough to eliminate treated hopper bands in about a week, because the diseased hoppers became sluggish and easy to catch.\n\n==Desert locust upsurges==\n===1915 Ottoman Syria locust infestation===\n{{see|1915 Ottoman Syria locust infestation}}\nFrom March to October 1915, [[Swarm behaviour|swarms]] of [[locust]]s stripped areas in and around [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Mount Lebanon]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] of almost all [[vegetation]].

The upsurge started as small independent outbreaks that developed in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. Two days of unusually heavy rains that stretched from Dakar, [[Senegal]] to [[Morocco]] in October allowed breeding conditions to remain favourable for the next six months and the desert locusts rapidly increased. Lack of rain and cold temperatures in the winter breeding area of northwest Africa in early 2005 slowed the development of the locusts and allowed the locust control agencies to stop the cycle. During the upsurge, nearly 130,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 were treated by ground and aerial operations in more than 20 countries. The costs of fighting this upsurge have been estimated by the [[FAO]] to have exceeded US$400 million, and harvest losses were valued at up to US$2.5 billion, which had disastrous effects on the [[food security]] situation in West Africa.\n\nThe countries affected by the 2004 outbreak were [[Algeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Chad]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[the Gambia]], [[Greece]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Niger]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Senegal]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]. \n\n===2019\u201320 East Africa and Asia infestation===\n{{main|2019\u201320 East Africa locust infestation|2019\u201320 Pakistan locust infestation}}\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\nSince January 2020, a very large population of desert locust gathered in [[Kenya]].

Copulation takes place when a mature male hops onto the back of a mature female and grips her body with his legs. Sperm is transferred from the tip of his abdomen to the tip of hers, where it is stored. The process takes several hours and one insemination is sufficient for a number of batches of eggs.<ref name=Handbook>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzdl.org/gsdlmod?e=d-00000-00---off-0hdl--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-10-0-0-11-10-0utfZz-8-00&a=d&c=hdl&cl=CL1.10&d=HASHd1edbf77fbe3fa2e5e3da5.4.2 |title=Desert locust: Life cycle |work=Locust Handbook |publisher=Humanity Development Library |accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe female then seeks suitable soft soil in which to lay her eggs. It needs to be the right temperature and degree of dampness and be in close proximity to other egg-laying females. She probes the soil with her abdomen and digs a hole into which an eggpod containing up to a hundred eggs is deposited. The egg pod is {{convert|3|to|4|cm|1|abbr=on}} long and the lower end is about {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} below the surface of the ground. The eggs are surrounded by foam and this hardens into a membrane and plugs the hole above the egg pod. The eggs absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The incubation period before the eggs hatch may be two weeks or much longer, depending on the temperature.<ref name=Handbook/>\n\n[[File:S. gregaria dense hopper band.jpg|thumb|left|Dense hopper band in [[Sudan]]]]\nThe newly hatched nymph soon begins to feed and, if it is a gregarious individual, is attracted to other hoppers and they group together. As it grows it needs to [[moulting|moult]] (shed its [[exoskeleton]]). Its hard cuticle splits and its body expands while the new exoskeleton is still soft. The stages between moulting are called [[instar]]s and the desert locust nymph undergoes five moults before becoming a winged adult. Immature and mature individuals in the gregarious phase form bands which feed, bask and move as cohesive units, while solitary phase individuals do not seek gregariousness.<ref name=Handbook/><ref name=\"Simpson1999\"/>\n\nAfter the fifth moult the insect is said to have fledged but it is not yet mature. It is at first soft and pink with drooping wings, but over the course of a few days, the cuticle hardens and  [[Hemolymph|haemolymph]] is pumped into the wings which stiffen them. Maturation can occur in two to four weeks when the food supply and weather conditions are suitable, but may take as long as six months when they are less ideal. Males start maturing first and give off an odour which stimulates maturation in the females. On maturing the insects turn yellow and the abdomens of the females start swelling with developing eggs.<ref name=Handbook/>\n\n==Ecology and swarming==\n[[File:DesertLocust.jpeg|thumb|left|Solitary (top) and gregarious (bottom) desert locust nymphs]]\nDesert locusts have two phases, the solitary phase and the gregarious phase. This is a type of [[polyphenism]]. It has been shown that solitary locusts nymphs and adults can behave gregariously within a few hours of being placed in a crowded situation, while it takes gregarious locusts one or more generations to become solitary when reared in isolation.<ref name=\"Simpson1999\">{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=S.J.|last2=McCaffery|first2=A.R.|last3=Hagele|first3=B.F.|year=1999|title=A behavioural analysis of phase change in thedesert locust|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=74|issue=4|pages=461\u2013480|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1999.tb00038.x}}</ref> There are differences in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and behaviour between the two phases. In the solitary phase the hoppers do not group together into bands but move about independently. Their colouring in the later instars tends to be greenish or brownish to match the colour of the herbage. The adults fly at night and are also coloured so as to blend into their surroundings, the immature adults being grey or beige and the mature adults being a pale yellowish colour. In the gregarious phase the hoppers bunch together and in the later instars develop a bold colouring with black markings on a yellow background. The immatures are pink and the mature adults are bright yellow and fly during the day in dense swarms.<ref name=Handbook/>\n\nThe change from an innocuous solitary insect to a voracious gregarious one normally follows a period of drought, when rain falls and vegetation flushes occur in major desert locust breeding locations. The population builds up rapidly and the competition for food increases.<ref name=Showler>{{cite web |url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/showler.htm |title=The Desert Locust in Africa and Western Asia: Complexities of War, Politics, Perilous Terrain, and Development |author=Showler, Allan T. |date=2013-03-04 |work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=2015-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408034918/http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/showler.htm |archivedate=2015-04-08 }}</ref> As hoppers get more crowded, the close physical contact causes the insects' hind legs to bump against one another. This [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] triggers a cascade of [[metabolic]] and behavioral changes that cause the insects to transform from the [[statary|solitary]] to the gregarious phase. When the hoppers become gregarious, their colouration changes from largely green to yellow and black, and the adults change from brown to pink (immature) or yellow (mature). Their bodies become shorter, and they give off a [[pheromone]] that causes them to be attracted to each other, enhancing hopper band and subsequently [[swarm]] formation. The nymphal pheromone is different from the adult one. When exposed to the adult pheromone, hoppers become confused and disoriented, because they can apparently no longer \"smell\" each other, though the visual and tactile stimuli remain. After a few days, the hopper bands disintegrate and those that escape predation become solitary again. It is possible that this effect could aid locust control in the future.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nDuring quiet periods, called recessions, desert locusts are confined to a 16-million-square-kilometer belt that extends from [[Mauritania]] through the [[Sahara Desert]] in [[northern Africa]], across the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and into northwest [[India]]. Under optimal ecological and climatic conditions, several successive generations can occur, causing swarms to form and invade countries on all sides of the recession area, as far north as [[Spain]] and [[Russia]], as far south as [[Nigeria]] and [[Kenya]], and as far east as [[India]] and southwest [[Asia]]. As many as 60 countries can be affected within an area of 32 million square kilometers, or approximately 20 percent of the Earth's land surface.\n\n[[File:Desert.locust.arp.jpg|thumb|Close-up]]\nLocust swarms fly with the wind at roughly the speed of the wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 kilometers in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (it becomes too cold at higher altitudes). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]], the [[Hindu Kush]] or the [[Himalayas]]. They will not venture into the [[rain forest]]s of Africa nor into central Europe. However, locust adults and swarms regularly cross the [[Red Sea]] between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from [[Africa]] to the [[Caribbean]] in ten days during the 1987-89 plague.<ref name=\"FAO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/focus/2006/1000345/|title=Biological control of locusts|date=31 July 2006|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> A single swarm can cover up to 1200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer (a total of around 50 to 100 billion locusts per swarm, representing 100,000 to 200,000 tons, considering an average mass of 2 grams per locust). The locust can live between three and six months, and there is a ten to 16-fold increase in locust numbers from one generation to the next.\n\n==Crop loss==\nIt is estimated that desert locusts consume the equivalent of their body weight ({{convert|2|g|2|abbr=on}}) each day in green vegetation. They are [[List of feeding behaviours#By food type|polyphagous]] and feed on leaves, shoots, flowers, fruit, seeds, stems and bark.

In the 1920s-1930s, locust control became a major field for international cooperation. The International Agricultural Institute developed several programmes aimed at exchanging data about the desert locust and international conferences were held in the 1930s: [[Rome]] in 1931, [[Paris]] in 1932, [[London]] in 1934, [[Cairo]] in 1936 and [[Brussels]] in 1938. Colonial empires were heavily involved in these attempts to control locust pests which affected heavily the Middle East and parts of Africa.<ref>Antonio Buj, \u00ab International Experimentations and Control of the Locust Plague \u2013 Africa in the First Half of the 20th Century \u00bb, in Yvon Chatelin, Christophe Bonneuil (eds.), Les sciences hors d\u2019Occident au XXe si\u00e8cle, Vol. 3 : Nature et environment, Paris, Orstom Editions, 1995, pp. 93-105.</ref> The USSR also used locust control as a way to expand its influence in the Middle East and Central Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ge/2014/00000007/00000002/art00011?crawler=true|title=Fighting Locusts Together: Pest Control and the Birth of Soviet Development Aid, 1920-1939|first=Etienne|last=Forestier-Peyrat|date=October 25, 2014|website=www.ingentaconnect.com}}</ref>\n\n[[FAO]]'s [http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS)] in Rome, Italy monitors the weather, ecological conditions and the locust situation on a daily basis. DLIS receives results of survey and control operations carried out by national teams in affected countries, and combines this information with [[satellite]] data such as [[MODIS]], rainfall estimates and seasonal temperature and rainfall predictions to assess the current situation and forecast the timing, scale and location of breeding and migration up to six weeks in advance. The situation assessments and forecasts are published in monthly locust bulletins that date back to the 1970s. These are supplemented by warnings and alerts to affected countries and the international community. Those since the 1990s are available on the [http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts FAO Locust Watch web site]. FAO also provides information and training to affected countries and coordinates funding from donor agencies in case of major upsurges and plagues.\n\nThe desert locust is a difficult pest to control, and control measures are further compounded by the large and often remote areas (16-30 million km\u00b2) where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic [[infrastructure]] in some affected countries, limited resources for locust monitoring and control, and political turmoil within and between affected countries further reduce the capacity of a country to undertake the necessary monitoring and control activities.\n\nAt present, the primary method of controlling desert locust infestations is with [[insecticides]] applied in small concentrated doses by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers at [[ultra-low volume]] (ULV) rates of application. The insecticide is acquired by the insect directly or via secondary pickup (i.e. walking over or eating the residue on a plant). Control is undertaken by [[government]] agencies in locust-affected countries or by specialized organizations such as the [http://dlco-ea.org/ Desert Locust Control Organization for East Africa (DLCO-EA)].\n\nThe desert locust has natural enemies such as predatory wasps and flies, [[parasitoid wasp]]s, predatory beetle larvae, [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s. These may be effective at keeping solitary populations in check but are of limited effects against gregarious desert locusts because of the enormous numbers of insects in the swarms and hopper bands.<ref name=Showler/>\n\nFarmers often try mechanical means of killing locusts, such as digging trenches and burying hopper bands, but this is very labour-intensive and is difficult to undertake when large infestations are scattered over a wide area. Farmers also try to scare locust swarms away from their fields by making noise, burning tires or other methods. This tends to shift the problem to neighbouring farms, and locust swarms can easily return to reinfest previously visited fields.\n\n==Biopesticides==\n[[Biological insecticide|Biopesticides]] include fungi, bacteria, [[neem]] extract and pheromones. The effectiveness of many biopesticides equals that of conventional chemical pesticides, but there are two distinct differences. Biopesticides in general take longer to kill insects, plant diseases, or weeds, usually between 2 and 10 days.\n\nThere are two types of biopesticides - biochemical and microbial. Biochemical pesticides are similar to naturally occurring chemicals and are nontoxic, such as insect pheromones used to locate mates, while microbial biopesticides, come from bacteria, fungi, algae or viruses that either occur naturally or are genetically altered. [[Entomopathogenic fungi]] generally suppress pests by mycosis: causing a disease that is specific to the insect.\n\n[[Biological control]] products have been under development since the late nineties; [[LUBILOSA#Commercialisation|Green Muscle]] and [[LUBILOSA#Post-LUBILOSA|NOVACRID]] are based on a naturally occurring [[entomopathogenic fungus]] (i.e. insects-infecting fungus), ''[[Metarhizium acridum]]''. Species of ''Metarhizium'' are widespread throughout the world, infecting many groups of insects, but show a low risk to humans, other [[mammal]]s and birds. The species ''M. acridum'' has specialised on short-horned [[caelifera|grasshopper]]s, to which group locusts belong, and has therefore been chosen as the active ingredient of the product.\n\nThe product is available in Australia under the name Green Guard and in Africa, it used to be available as Green Muscle. However, since Green Muscle seems to have disappeared from the market, another product, NOVACRID, was developed for Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. These products are applied in the same way as chemical insecticides, but do not kill as quickly. At recommended doses, the fungus can take up two weeks to kill up to 90% of the locusts. For that reason, it is recommended for use mainly against hoppers, the wingless early stages of locusts. These are mostly found in the desert, far from cropping areas, where the delay in death does not result in damage. The advantage of the product is that it affects only grasshoppers and locusts, which makes it much safer than chemical insecticides. Specifically, it allows the natural enemies of locusts and grasshoppers to continue their beneficial work. These include birds, [[parasitoid]] and [[predator]]y [[wasp]]s, parasitoid [[fly|flies]] and certain species of [[beetle]]s. Though natural enemies cannot prevent plagues, they can limit the frequency of outbreaks and contribute to their control. Biopesticides are also safer to use in environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks or near rivers and other water bodies.\n\nGreen Muscle was developed under the [[LUBILOSA]] Programme, which was initiated in 1989 in response to environmental concerns over the heavy use of chemical insecticides to control locusts and grasshoppers during the 1987-89 plague. The project focused on the use of beneficial disease-causing [[microorganism]]s ([[pathogen]]s) as biological control agents for grasshoppers and locusts. These insects were considered to be too mobile and to reproduce too fast to be readily controlled by classical biological control. Pathogens have the advantage that many can be produced in artificial culture in large quantities and be used with ordinary spraying equipment. Entomopathogenic fungi were traditionally seen as needing humid conditions to work well. However, the LUBILOSA Programme found a way to avoid this by [[pesticide application|spraying]] fungal spores in an oil [[pesticide formulation|formulation]]. Even under desert conditions, Green Muscle can be used to kill locusts and other [[Acrididae|Acridid]] pests, such as the [[Senegalese grasshopper]]. During trials in Algeria and Mauritania in 2005 and 2006, various natural enemies, but especially birds, were abundant enough to eliminate treated hopper bands in about a week, because the diseased hoppers became sluggish and easy to catch.\n\n==Desert locust upsurges==\n===1915 Ottoman Syria locust infestation===\n{{see|1915 Ottoman Syria locust infestation}}\nFrom March to October 1915, [[Swarm behaviour|swarms]] of [[locust]]s stripped areas in and around [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Mount Lebanon]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] of almost all [[vegetation]].

The upsurge started as small independent outbreaks that developed in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. Two days of unusually heavy rains that stretched from Dakar, [[Senegal]] to [[Morocco]] in October allowed breeding conditions to remain favourable for the next six months and the desert locusts rapidly increased. Lack of rain and cold temperatures in the winter breeding area of northwest Africa in early 2005 slowed the development of the locusts and allowed the locust control agencies to stop the cycle. During the upsurge, nearly 130,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 were treated by ground and aerial operations in more than 20 countries. The costs of fighting this upsurge have been estimated by the [[FAO]] to have exceeded US$400 million, and harvest losses were valued at up to US$2.5 billion, which had disastrous effects on the [[food security]] situation in West Africa.\n\nThe countries affected by the 2004 outbreak were [[Algeria]], [[Burkina Faso]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Chad]], [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], [[the Gambia]], [[Greece]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Niger]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Senegal]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]. \n\n===2019\u201320 East Africa and Asia infestation===\n{{main|2019\u201320 East Africa locust infestation|2019\u201320 Pakistan locust infestation}}\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\nSince January 2020, a very large population of desert locust gathered in [[Kenya]].

They failed to overthrow the revolutionary regime and French territorial gains since 1793 were confirmed. In the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801, France held all of its previous gains and obtained new lands in Tuscany, Italy, while Austria was granted Venetia and the Dalmatian coast. Britain and France signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in March 1802, bringing an interval of peace in Europe that lasted for 14 months. By May 1803 Britain and France were again at war and in 1805 Britain assembled the [[Third Coalition]] to resume the war against France.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|French Revolutionary Wars|War of the First Coalition}}\n\nOn 20&nbsp;April 1792, the [[French Legislative Assembly]] declared war on Austria. In the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792\u201397), France fought against most of the states with which it shared a border, as well as Great Britain, Portugal and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at the outset of the war, they were ultimately repulsed from French territory and then lost significant territories to the French, who began to set up [[French client republic|client republics]] in their occupied territories. The efforts of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the northern [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars]] pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Leoben]] (18&nbsp;April 1797) and the subsequent [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (October 1797).<ref>Timothy Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars'' pp. 41\u201359.</ref> leaving Britain to fight on alone and marking the end of the coalition.\n\nIn the summer of 1798, Bonaparte led an [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|expedition to Egypt]], where his army was trapped and which, after he returned to France, surrendered. Meanwhile, during his absence from Europe, the outbreak of violence in [[Switzerland]] drew French support against the old [[Swiss Confederation]].  When revolutionaries overthrew the cantonal government in [[Bern]], the French [[Army of the Alps]] invaded, ostensibly to support the Swiss Republicans.  In northern Italy, Russian general [[Aleksandr Suvorov]] won [[Suvorov's Italian and Swiss expedition|a string of victories]], driving the French under [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] out of the [[Po River|Po Valley]], forcing them back on the [[French Alps]] and the coast around [[Genoa]]. However, the Russian armies in the [[Helvetic Republic]] were defeated by French commander [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], and Suvorov eventually withdrew. Ultimately the Russians left the Coalition when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] insisted on the right to search all vessels it stopped at sea.  In Germany, Archduke Charles of Austria drove the French under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan back across the [[Rhine]] and won several victories in Switzerland. Jourdan was replaced by Massena, who then combined the Armies of the Danube and Helvetia.\n\n==Peace interrupted==\n{{details|Mediterranean campaign of 1798}}\n\nFrom October 1797 until March 1799 France and Austria, the signatories of the Treaty of Campo Formio, avoided armed conflict but remained suspicious of each other and several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement. The French demanded additional territory not mentioned in the Treaty. The Habsburgs were reluctant to hand over designated territories, much less additional ones. The [[Second Congress of Rastatt|Congress at Rastatt]] proved inept at orchestrating the transfer of territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand of Naples]] refused to pay tribute to France, followed by the Neapolitan rebellion and the subsequent establishment of the [[Parthenopaean Republic]]. Republicans in the Swiss cantons, supported by the French army, overthrew the central government in Bern and established the [[Helvetic Republic]].<ref>Blanning, pp. 230\u201332.</ref>\n\nOther factors contributed to the rising tensions. On his way to [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|Egypt]], [[Napoleon]] had stopped at the heavily fortified port city of [[Valletta]], the [[capital city]] of [[Malta]]. Grand Master [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], who ruled the island, would only allow two ships at a time into the harbour, in accordance with the island's neutrality. Bonaparte immediately ordered the bombardment of Valletta and on 11 June, General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]] directed a [[amphibious operation|landing]] of several thousand French troops at strategic locations around the island. The French Knights of the order deserted, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a successful resistance. Bonaparte forcibly removed the other Knights from their possessions, angering [[Paul I of Russia|Paul, Tsar of Russia]], who was the honorary head of the Order. The [[French Directory]], furthermore, was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the British actually discussed this possibility.<ref>John Gallagher. ''Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme,'' Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3875-6}} p. 70.</ref>\n\n==Preliminaries to war==\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1798.jpg|thumb|300px|Strategic overview of operations in Europe and the Mediterranean in 1798\u20131799]]\n\nMilitary planners in Paris understood that the Upper Rhine Valley, the south-western German territories, and Switzerland were strategically important for the defence of the Republic. The Swiss passes commanded access to northern Italy; consequently, the army that held those passes could move troops to and from northern and southern theatres quickly.<ref>Gunther E. Rothenberg. ''Napoleon's Great Adversaries: Archduke Charles and the Austrian Army, 1792\u20131914,'' Stroud, (Gloucester): Spellmount, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-86227-383-2}} pp. 70\u201374.</ref>\n\nToward this end, in early November 1798, Jourdan arrived in [[H\u00fcningen]] to take command of the French forces there, the so-called Army of Observation because its function was to ''observe'' the security of the French border on the Rhine.  Once there, he assessed the quality and disposition of the forces and identified needed supplies and manpower.  He found the army woefully inadequate for its assignment. The [[Army of the Danube]], and its two flanking armies, the [[Army of Helvetia]] and the [[Army of Mainz|Army of Mayence]], or Mainz, were equally short of manpower, supplies, ammunition, and training; most resources were already directed to the Army in Northern Italy, and Army of Britain, and the Egyptian expedition. Jourdan documented assiduously these shortages, pointing out in lengthy correspondence to the Directory the consequences of an under-manned and under-supplied army; his petitions seemed to have little effect on the Directory, which sent neither significant additional manpower nor supplies.<ref>Jourdan, pp. 60\u201390.</ref>\n\nJourdan's orders were to take the army into Germany and secure strategic positions, particularly on the south-west roads through [[Stockach]] and [[Schaffhausen]], at the western-most border of [[Lake Constance]]. Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland), [[Andre Massena]] would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Winterthur]]. These positions would prevent the Allies of the [[Second Coalition]] from moving troops back and forth between the northern Italian and German theatres, but would allow French access to these strategic passes.  Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna.  Finally, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.<ref>Jourdan, pp. 50\u201360; Rothenberg, pp. 70\u201374.</ref>\n\n==War==\n\n{{main|Russo-Ottoman Alliance (1799)}}\nThe coalition first began to come together on 19 May 1798 when Austria and the Kingdom of Naples signed an alliance in Vienna. The first military action under the alliance occurred on November 29 when Austrian General [[Karl Mack]] occupied Rome and restored Papal authority with a Neapolitan army.<ref name=Kent>Emerson Kent</ref>\n\nBy December 1, the Kingdom of Naples had signed alliances with both Russia and Great Britain. And by 2 January 1799, additional alliances were in place between Russia, Great Britain, and the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Kent>Emerson Kent</ref>\n\n===1799===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\nIn Europe, the allies mounted several invasions, including [[Suvorov's Italian expedition|campaigns in Italy and Switzerland]] and an [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland|Anglo-Russian invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Russian general [[Aleksandr Suvorov]] inflicted a series of defeats on the French in Italy, driving them back to the Alps. However, the allies were less successful in the Netherlands, where the British retreated after a defeat [[Battle of Castricum|at Castricum]], and in Switzerland, where after initial victories a Russian army was completely routed at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]]. These reverses, as well as British insistence on searching shipping in the [[Baltic Sea]] led to Russia withdrawing from the Coalition.<ref>Christopher Duffy, ''Eagles over the Alps: Suvorov in Italy and Switzerland, 1799'' (1999)</ref>\n\nNapoleon himself invaded Syria from Egypt, but after a failed [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] he retreated to Egypt, repelling a British-Turkish invasion. Alerted to the political and military crisis in France, he returned, leaving his army behind, and used his popularity and army support to mount [[18 Brumaire|a coup]] that made him [[First Consul]], the head of the French government.<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution Volume II: from 1793 to 1799'' (1964) ch 13</ref>\n\n===1800===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1800 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\n[[File:Bataille de Hohenlinden.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|General Moreau]] at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]]]]\nNapoleon sent Moreau to campaign in Germany, and went himself to raise a new army at [[Dijon]] and march through Switzerland to attack the Austrian armies in Italy from behind. Narrowly avoiding defeat, he defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo (1800)|the Battle of Marengo]] and reoccupied northern Italy.<ref>David Hollins, ''The Battle of Marengo 1800'' (2000)</ref>\n\nMoreau meanwhile invaded [[Bavaria]] and won a great battle against Austria at [[Battle of Hohenlinden (1800)|Hohenlinden]]. Moreau continued toward Vienna and the Austrians sued for peace.<ref>George Armand Furse, ''1800 Marengo and Hohenlinden'' (2009)</ref>\n\n===1801===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1801 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\nPrior to the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] of July/August 1800, [[Ireland]] was a separate kingdom, with its own Parliament, held in a personal union with Great Britain under the Crown. In response to the 1798 [[Society_of_United_Irishmen|United Irishmen]] revolt, it became part of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], effective January 1 1800. \n\nThe Austrians negotiated the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], basically accepting the terms of the previous [[Treaty of Campo Formio]]. In Egypt, the Ottomans and British invaded and finally compelled the French to surrender after the fall of [[Siege_of_Cairo|Cairo]] and Alexandria.<ref>Piers Mackesy, ''British Victory in Egypt, 1801: The End of Napoleon's Conquest'' (1995) [https://www.questia.com/library/106127266/british-victory-in-egypt-1801-the-end-of-napoleon-s online]</ref>\n\nBritain continued the war at sea. A [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|coalition of non-combatants]] including Prussia, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden joined to protect neutral shipping from Britain's blockade, resulting in [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s surprise attack on the Danish fleet in harbour at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref>Dudley Pope, ''The Great Gamble: Nelson at Copenhagen'' (1972).</ref>\n\nFrance and Spain invaded Portugal, in the [[War of Oranges]], forcing Portugal to sign the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)]].\n\nIn December 1801, France despatched the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]] to recapture the island, which had been independent since the 1791 [[Haitian Revolution]]. This included over 30,000 troops, many experienced and elite veterans but ended in catastrophic failure; by the end of 1802, an estimated 15,000 \u2013 22,000 had died of disease and [[yellow fever]], among them Napoleon's brother-in-law, General [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]].\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn 1802, Britain and France signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]], ending the war. Thus began the longest period of peace during the period 1792\u20131815. The treaty is generally considered to be the most appropriate point to mark the transition between the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although Napoleon was not [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowned emperor]] until 1804.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Acerbi, Enrico.

They failed to overthrow the revolutionary regime and French territorial gains since 1793 were confirmed. In the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in 1801, France held all of its previous gains and obtained new lands in Tuscany, Italy, while Austria was granted Venetia and the Dalmatian coast. Britain and France signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in March 1802, bringing an interval of peace in Europe that lasted for 14 months. By May 1803 Britain and France were again at war and in 1805 Britain assembled the [[Third Coalition]] to resume the war against France.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|French Revolutionary Wars|War of the First Coalition}}\n\nOn 20&nbsp;April 1792, the [[French Legislative Assembly]] declared war on Austria. In the [[War of the First Coalition]] (1792\u201397), France fought against most of the states with which it shared a border, as well as Great Britain, Portugal and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at the outset of the war, they were ultimately repulsed from French territory and then lost significant territories to the French, who began to set up [[French client republic|client republics]] in their occupied territories. The efforts of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the northern [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars]] pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Leoben]] (18&nbsp;April 1797) and the subsequent [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (October 1797).<ref>Timothy Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars'' pp. 41\u201359.</ref> leaving Britain to fight on alone and marking the end of the coalition.\n\nIn the summer of 1798, Bonaparte led an [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|expedition to Egypt]], where his army was trapped and which, after he returned to France, surrendered. Meanwhile, during his absence from Europe, the outbreak of violence in [[Switzerland]] drew French support against the old [[Swiss Confederation]].  When revolutionaries overthrew the cantonal government in [[Bern]], the French [[Army of the Alps]] invaded, ostensibly to support the Swiss Republicans.  In northern Italy, Russian general [[Aleksandr Suvorov]] won [[Suvorov's Italian and Swiss expedition|a string of victories]], driving the French under [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]] out of the [[Po River|Po Valley]], forcing them back on the [[French Alps]] and the coast around [[Genoa]]. However, the Russian armies in the [[Helvetic Republic]] were defeated by French commander [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], and Suvorov eventually withdrew. Ultimately the Russians left the Coalition when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] insisted on the right to search all vessels it stopped at sea.  In Germany, Archduke Charles of Austria drove the French under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan back across the [[Rhine]] and won several victories in Switzerland. Jourdan was replaced by Massena, who then combined the Armies of the Danube and Helvetia.\n\n==Peace interrupted==\n{{details|Mediterranean campaign of 1798}}\n\nFrom October 1797 until March 1799 France and Austria, the signatories of the Treaty of Campo Formio, avoided armed conflict but remained suspicious of each other and several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement. The French demanded additional territory not mentioned in the Treaty. The Habsburgs were reluctant to hand over designated territories, much less additional ones. The [[Second Congress of Rastatt|Congress at Rastatt]] proved inept at orchestrating the transfer of territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand of Naples]] refused to pay tribute to France, followed by the Neapolitan rebellion and the subsequent establishment of the [[Parthenopaean Republic]]. Republicans in the Swiss cantons, supported by the French army, overthrew the central government in Bern and established the [[Helvetic Republic]].<ref>Blanning, pp. 230\u201332.</ref>\n\nOther factors contributed to the rising tensions. On his way to [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|Egypt]], [[Napoleon]] had stopped at the heavily fortified port city of [[Valletta]], the [[capital city]] of [[Malta]]. Grand Master [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], who ruled the island, would only allow two ships at a time into the harbour, in accordance with the island's neutrality. Bonaparte immediately ordered the bombardment of Valletta and on 11 June, General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]] directed a [[amphibious operation|landing]] of several thousand French troops at strategic locations around the island. The French Knights of the order deserted, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a successful resistance. Bonaparte forcibly removed the other Knights from their possessions, angering [[Paul I of Russia|Paul, Tsar of Russia]], who was the honorary head of the Order. The [[French Directory]], furthermore, was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the British actually discussed this possibility.<ref>John Gallagher. ''Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme,'' Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3875-6}} p. 70.</ref>\n\n==Preliminaries to war==\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Europe 1798.jpg|thumb|300px|Strategic overview of operations in Europe and the Mediterranean in 1798\u20131799]]\n\nMilitary planners in Paris understood that the Upper Rhine Valley, the south-western German territories, and Switzerland were strategically important for the defence of the Republic. The Swiss passes commanded access to northern Italy; consequently, the army that held those passes could move troops to and from northern and southern theatres quickly.<ref>Gunther E. Rothenberg. ''Napoleon's Great Adversaries: Archduke Charles and the Austrian Army, 1792\u20131914,'' Stroud, (Gloucester): Spellmount, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-86227-383-2}} pp. 70\u201374.</ref>\n\nToward this end, in early November 1798, Jourdan arrived in [[H\u00fcningen]] to take command of the French forces there, the so-called Army of Observation because its function was to ''observe'' the security of the French border on the Rhine.  Once there, he assessed the quality and disposition of the forces and identified needed supplies and manpower.  He found the army woefully inadequate for its assignment. The [[Army of the Danube]], and its two flanking armies, the [[Army of Helvetia]] and the [[Army of Mainz|Army of Mayence]], or Mainz, were equally short of manpower, supplies, ammunition, and training; most resources were already directed to the Army in Northern Italy, and Army of Britain, and the Egyptian expedition. Jourdan documented assiduously these shortages, pointing out in lengthy correspondence to the Directory the consequences of an under-manned and under-supplied army; his petitions seemed to have little effect on the Directory, which sent neither significant additional manpower nor supplies.<ref>Jourdan, pp. 60\u201390.</ref>\n\nJourdan's orders were to take the army into Germany and secure strategic positions, particularly on the south-west roads through [[Stockach]] and [[Schaffhausen]], at the western-most border of [[Lake Constance]]. Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland), [[Andre Massena]] would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Winterthur]]. These positions would prevent the Allies of the [[Second Coalition]] from moving troops back and forth between the northern Italian and German theatres, but would allow French access to these strategic passes.  Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna.  Finally, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.<ref>Jourdan, pp. 50\u201360; Rothenberg, pp. 70\u201374.</ref>\n\n==War==\n\n{{main|Russo-Ottoman Alliance (1799)}}\nThe coalition first began to come together on 19 May 1798 when Austria and the Kingdom of Naples signed an alliance in Vienna. The first military action under the alliance occurred on November 29 when Austrian General [[Karl Mack]] occupied Rome and restored Papal authority with a Neapolitan army.<ref name=Kent>Emerson Kent</ref>\n\nBy December 1, the Kingdom of Naples had signed alliances with both Russia and Great Britain. And by 2 January 1799, additional alliances were in place between Russia, Great Britain, and the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Kent>Emerson Kent</ref>\n\n===1799===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\nIn Europe, the allies mounted several invasions, including [[Suvorov's Italian expedition|campaigns in Italy and Switzerland]] and an [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland|Anglo-Russian invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Russian general [[Aleksandr Suvorov]] inflicted a series of defeats on the French in Italy, driving them back to the Alps. However, the allies were less successful in the Netherlands, where the British retreated after a defeat [[Battle of Castricum|at Castricum]], and in Switzerland, where after initial victories a Russian army was completely routed at the [[Second Battle of Zurich]]. These reverses, as well as British insistence on searching shipping in the [[Baltic Sea]] led to Russia withdrawing from the Coalition.<ref>Christopher Duffy, ''Eagles over the Alps: Suvorov in Italy and Switzerland, 1799'' (1999)</ref>\n\nNapoleon himself invaded Syria from Egypt, but after a failed [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] he retreated to Egypt, repelling a British-Turkish invasion. Alerted to the political and military crisis in France, he returned, leaving his army behind, and used his popularity and army support to mount [[18 Brumaire|a coup]] that made him [[First Consul]], the head of the French government.<ref>Georges Lefebvre, ''The French Revolution Volume II: from 1793 to 1799'' (1964) ch 13</ref>\n\n===1800===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1800 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\n[[File:Bataille de Hohenlinden.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|General Moreau]] at the [[Battle of Hohenlinden]]]]\nNapoleon sent Moreau to campaign in Germany, and went himself to raise a new army at [[Dijon]] and march through Switzerland to attack the Austrian armies in Italy from behind. Narrowly avoiding defeat, he defeated the Austrians at [[Battle of Marengo (1800)|the Battle of Marengo]] and reoccupied northern Italy.<ref>David Hollins, ''The Battle of Marengo 1800'' (2000)</ref>\n\nMoreau meanwhile invaded [[Bavaria]] and won a great battle against Austria at [[Battle of Hohenlinden (1800)|Hohenlinden]]. Moreau continued toward Vienna and the Austrians sued for peace.<ref>George Armand Furse, ''1800 Marengo and Hohenlinden'' (2009)</ref>\n\n===1801===\n{{See also|Campaigns of 1801 in the French Revolutionary Wars}}\n\nPrior to the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] of July/August 1800, [[Ireland]] was a separate kingdom, with its own Parliament, held in a personal union with Great Britain under the Crown. In response to the 1798 [[Society_of_United_Irishmen|United Irishmen]] revolt, it became part of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], effective January 1 1800. \n\nThe Austrians negotiated the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]], basically accepting the terms of the previous [[Treaty of Campo Formio]]. In Egypt, the Ottomans and British invaded and finally compelled the French to surrender after the fall of [[Siege_of_Cairo|Cairo]] and Alexandria.<ref>Piers Mackesy, ''British Victory in Egypt, 1801: The End of Napoleon's Conquest'' (1995) [https://www.questia.com/library/106127266/british-victory-in-egypt-1801-the-end-of-napoleon-s online]</ref>\n\nBritain continued the war at sea. A [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|coalition of non-combatants]] including Prussia, Russia, Denmark, and Sweden joined to protect neutral shipping from Britain's blockade, resulting in [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s surprise attack on the Danish fleet in harbour at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref>Dudley Pope, ''The Great Gamble: Nelson at Copenhagen'' (1972).</ref>\n\nFrance and Spain invaded Portugal, in the [[War of Oranges]], forcing Portugal to sign the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)]].\n\nIn December 1801, France despatched the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]] to recapture the island, which had been independent since the 1791 [[Haitian Revolution]]. This included over 30,000 troops, many experienced and elite veterans but ended in catastrophic failure; by the end of 1802, an estimated 15,000 \u2013 22,000 had died of disease and [[yellow fever]], among them Napoleon's brother-in-law, General [[Charles_Leclerc_(general)|Charles Leclerc]].\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn 1802, Britain and France signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]], ending the war. Thus began the longest period of peace during the period 1792\u20131815. The treaty is generally considered to be the most appropriate point to mark the transition between the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although Napoleon was not [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowned emperor]] until 1804.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Acerbi, Enrico.

The length on the epaulettes distinguishes rank; in this case the 2.5-inch length indicates the rank of assistant surgeon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/157862|title=Military jacket|last=|first=|date=|website=The Met|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\nEpaulettes bear some resemblance to the shoulder [[pteruges]] of ancient [[Roman Army|Roman]] military costumes. However, their direct origin lies in the bunches of ribbons worn on the shoulders of [[military coat]]s at the end of the 17th century, which were partially decorative and partially intended to prevent [[shoulder belt (military)|shoulder belt]]s from slipping. These ribbons were tied into a knot that left the fringed end free. This established the basic design of the epaulette as it evolved through the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>John Mollo, page 49 \"Military Fashion\", {{ISBN|0-214-65349-8}}</ref>\n\nFrom the 18th century on, epaulettes were used in the French and other armies to indicate rank. The rank of an officer could be determined by whether an epaulette was worn on the left shoulder, the right shoulder, or on both. Later a \"counter-epaulette\" (with no fringe) was worn on the opposite shoulder of those who wore only a single epaulette. Epaulettes were made in [[silver]] or [[gold]] for officers and in cloth of various colors for the enlisted men of various arms.  Certain categories of cavalry wore flexible metal epaulettes referred to as shoulder scales, rarely worn on the field.\n\nBy the early 18th century, epaulettes had become the distinguishing feature of commissioned rank. This led officers of military units still without epaulettes to petition for the right to wear epaulettes to ensure that their status would be recognized.<ref>Wilkinson-Latham, R: ''The Royal Navy 1790\u20131970'', page 5. Osprey Publishing, 1977</ref>  \nDuring the Napoleonic Wars and subsequently through the 19th century, [[grenadiers]], [[light infantry]], [[voltigeurs]] and other specialist categories of infantry in many European armies wore cloth epaulettes with wool fringes in various colors to distinguish them from ordinary [[line infantry]]. \"Flying artillery\" wore \"wings\", similar to an epaulette but with only a bit of fringe on the outside, which matched the shoulder seam. Heavy [[artillery]] wore small balls representing [[ammunition]] on their shoulders.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAn intermediate form in some services, such as the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]], is the [[shoulder board]], which neither has a fringe nor extends beyond the shoulder seam. This originated during the 19th century as a simplified version for service wear of the heavy and conspicuous full dress epaulette with bullion fringes.\n\n==Modern derivations==\nToday, epaulettes have mostly been replaced by a five-sided flap of cloth called a [[shoulder board]], which is sewn into the shoulder seam and the end buttoned like an epaulette.\n\nFrom the shoulder board was developed the [[shoulder mark]], a flat cloth tube that is worn over the shoulder strap and carries embroidered or pinned-on rank insignia. The advantages of this are the ability to easily change the insignia as occasions warrant.\n\nAirline pilot uniform shirts generally include cloth flattened tubular epaulettes having cloth or bullion braid stripes, attached by shoulder straps integral to the shirts.  The rank of the wearer is designated by the number of stripes:  Traditionally four for captain, three for first officer (copilot), two for second officer (flight engineer). However, rank insignia are airline specific. For example, at some airlines, two stripes denote junior first officer and one stripe second officer (cruise or relief pilot).  Airline captains' uniform caps usually will have a braid pattern on the bill.\n\n== Belgium ==\n[[File:BELGICANA GRENADIERS CARABINIERS PRINCEPS BAUDOUIN.jpg|thumbnail|Belgian Grenadiers with red fringed epaulettes]]\n\nIn the Belgian army, red epaulettes with white fringes are worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the [[Belgian Royal Escort|Royal Escort]] while fully red ones are worn by the [[Grenadiers]]. Trumpeters of the Royal Escort are distinguished by all red epaulettes while officers of the two units wear silver or gold respectively.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:Messkit1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Canadian officers in mess dress or mess kit]]\n[[File:EpaulettesOfProvoWallisMaritimeCommandMuseum.JPG|thumb|Epaulettes of [[Provo Wallis]], [[Maritime Command Museum]], [[CFB Halifax]]]]\nIn the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], epaulettes are still worn on some Army [[Full dress|Full Dress]], [[Patrol Dress]], and [[Mess Dress]] uniforms. Epaulettes in the form of shoulder boards are worn with the officer's white Naval Service Dress. \n\nAfter the [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces|unification of the Forces]], and prior to the issue of the [[Uniforms of the Canadian Forces#Distinct Environmental Uniform|Distinct Environmental Uniforms]], musicians of the [[Band Branch (Canadian Forces)|Band Branch]] wore epaulettes of braided gold cord.\n\n== France ==\nUntil 1914, officers of most [[French Army]] infantry regiments wore gold epaulettes in full dress, while those of mounted units wore silver. No insignia was worn on the epaulette itself, though the bullion fringe falling from the crescent differed according to rank.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Jouineau, Officers and Soldiers of the French Army 1914, {{ISBN|978-2-352-50104-6}}</ref> Other ranks of most branches of the infantry, as well as [[cuirassier]]s wore detachable epaulettes of various colours (red for line infantry, green for [[Chasseur]]s, yellow for Colonial Infantry etc.) with woollen fringes, of a traditional pattern that dated back to the 18th Century. Other cavalry such as [[hussar]]s, [[dragoons]] and chasseurs \u00e0 cheval wore special epaulettes of a style originally intended to deflect sword blows from the shoulder.\n  \nIn the modern French Army, epaulettes are still worn by those units retaining 19th-century-style full dress uniforms, notably the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|ESM Saint-Cyr]] and the [[Garde R\u00e9publicaine]]. The [[French Foreign Legion]] continued to wear their green and red epaulettes, except for a break from 1915 to 1930. In recent years, the Marine Infantry and some other units have readopted their traditional fringed epaulettes in various colours for ceremonial parades. The [[Marine nationale]] and the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] do not use epaulettes, but non-commissioned and commissioned officers wear a gilded shoulder strap called ''attente''{{cn|date=July 2019}}, which  original function was to clip the epaulette onto the shoulder. The ''[[attentes]]''{{cn|date=July 2019}} are also worn by Army generals on dress uniform.\n{{see also|:Commons:Category:Attentes}}\n\n<gallery>\nImage:First Battalion ESM Bastille Day 2007 n2.jpg|Cadets of the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|ESM Saint-Cyr]] in full uniform.

For ranks up to and including captain these were \"scale\" epaulettes without fringes, for majors and colonels with fine fringes and for generals with a heavy fringe. The base of the epaulette was of regimental colors. For ordinary duty, dress \"shoulder-cords\" of silver braid intertwined with state colors, were worn.<ref>page 590, Volume XXVII, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition</ref>\n\nDuring the period 1919-45, [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] uniforms were known for a four cord braided \"figure-of-eight\" decoration which acted as a shoulder board for senior and general officers. This was called a \"shoulder knot\" and was in silver with the specialty color piping (for field officers) and silver with red border (for generals). Although it was once seen on US Army uniforms, it remains only in the [[Mess dress|mess uniform]]. A  similar form of shoulder knot was worn by officers of the [[British Army]] in full dress until 1914 and is retained by the [[Household Cavalry]] today. Epaulettes of this pattern are used by the [[Republic of Korea Army]]'s general officers and were widely worn by officers of the armies of Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia; all of which formerly wore uniforms closely following the Imperial German model. The Chilean Army still retains the German style of epaulette in the uniforms of its ceremonial units, the Military Academy and the NCO School while the 5th Cavalry Regiment \"Aca Caraya\" of the [[Paraguayan Army]] sports both epaulettes and shoulder knots in its dress uniforms (save for a platoon wearing [[Chaco War]] uniforms). Epaulettes of the German pattern (as well as shoulder knots) are used by officers of ceremonial units and schools of the [[Bolivian Army]].\n\n==Haiti==\nGold epaulettes in [[Haiti]], were frequently worn throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in full dress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-28YAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281&dq=haitian+army+gold+epaulettes&source=bl&ots=cTgM3AsFYh&sig=62Y2n1At4l57S5cyY4ov5ugZhy0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fOSoVJDyA4SngwTY4oH4Aw&ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=haitian%20army%20gold%20epaulettes&f=false |title=Education, Volume 23 |publisher=New England Publishing Company |page=281 |year=1903 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> During the [[Haitian Revolution]], Gen.

The epaulette was officially incorporated into Swedish uniform regulations in 1792, although foreign recruited regiments had had them earlier. Senior officers were to wear golden crowns to distinguish their rank from lower ranking officers who wore golden stars.\n\nEpaulettes were discontinued on the field uniform in the mid-19th century, switching to rank insignia on the collar of the uniform jacket. Epaulettes were discontinued when they were removed from the general issue [[Full dress#Military|dress uniform]] in the 1930s. They are, however, still worn by the Royal Lifeguards and by military bands when in ceremonial full dress.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:K1_Parad_5.jpg|Royal Lifeguards Officer in ceremonial full dress at the Royal Palace in Stockholm\nFile:King Oscar II of Sweden in uniform.png|Swedish king [[Oscar II]] wearing an admiral's uniform, as shown by the three stars on his epaulettes\n</gallery>\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:Epaulette mp3h7527.jpg|thumb|[[Shoulder mark]] of a contemporary British OG (Olive Green) pullover with RAF [[Sergeant]] insignia.

The epaulette was officially incorporated into [[Royal Navy]] uniform regulations in 1795, although some officers wore them before this date. Under this system, [[flag officer]]s wore silver stars on their epaulettes to distinguish their ranks. A [[Captain (naval)|captain]] with at least three years seniority had two plain epaulettes, while a junior captain wore one on the right shoulder, and a [[commander]] one on the left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/search/lightbox.cfm/category/90266|title=Epaulettes at the National Maritime Museum website|work=NMM.ac.uk|access-date=30 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930034622/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/search/lightbox.cfm/category/90266|archive-date=30 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1855, army officers' large, gold-fringed epaulettes were abolished<ref>Major R.M. Barnes, page 260 \"A History of the Regiments and Uniforms of the British Army\", First Sphere Books edition 1972</ref> and replaced by a simplified equivalent officially known as twisted shoulder-cords.<ref>Section 24 \"Dress Regulations for the Army 1900</ref> These were generally worn with full dress uniforms until 1939. Naval officers retained the historic fringed epaulettes for full dress during this period.\n\nBritish cavalry on active service in the Sudan (1898) and during the [[Boer War]] (1899\u20131902) sometimes wore epaulettes made of [[chainmail]] to protect against sword blows landing on the shoulder. The blue \"Number 1 dress\" uniforms of some British cavalry regiments and [[yeomanry]] units still retain this feature in ornamental silvered form.<ref>R.M. Barnes page 316 \"Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire\", Sphere Books 1972</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902, the [[British Army]] stopped wearing epaulettes in the field, switching to rank insignia embroidered on the cuffs of the uniform jacket. During [[World War I]], this was found to make officers a target for snipers, so the insignia was frequently moved to the shoulder straps, where it was less conspicuous.\n\nThe current multi terrain pattern (MTP) and the older [[British Army uniform#No.8: Temperate combat dress|combat uniform]] (DPM) have the insignia formerly used on shoulder straps displayed on a single strap worn vertically in the centre of the chest. Earlier DPM uniforms had shoulder straps on the shoulders, though only officers wore rank on [[rank slides]] which attached to these straps, other ranks wore rank on the upper right sleeve at this time though later on [[regimental titles]] were worn on the rank slides. This practice continued into later patterns where rank was worn on the chest, rank was also added.\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:CharlesGriffin.jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen.

The rank insignia was of a contrasting metal, silver on gold and vice versa.\n\nIn 1851, the epaulettes became universally gold. Both majors and second lieutenants had no specific insignia. A major would have been recognizable as he would have worn the more elaborate epaulette fringes of a senior field officer. The rank insignia was silver for senior officers and gold for the bars of captains and first lieutenants. The reason for the choice of silver eagles over gold ones is thought to be one of economy; there were more cavalry and artillery colonels than infantry so it was cheaper to replace the numerically fewer gold ones.\n\nShoulder straps were adopted to replace epaulettes for field duty in 1836.\n\nLicensed officers of the [[U.S. Merchant Marine]] may wear [[shoulder marks]] and sleeve stripes appropriate to their rank and branch of service. Deck officers wear a foul anchor above the stripes on their shoulder marks and engineering officers wear a three-bladed propeller.

The length on the epaulettes distinguishes rank; in this case the 2.5-inch length indicates the rank of assistant surgeon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/157862|title=Military jacket|last=|first=|date=|website=The Met|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\nEpaulettes bear some resemblance to the shoulder [[pteruges]] of ancient [[Roman Army|Roman]] military costumes. However, their direct origin lies in the bunches of ribbons worn on the shoulders of [[military coat]]s at the end of the 17th century, which were partially decorative and partially intended to prevent [[shoulder belt (military)|shoulder belt]]s from slipping. These ribbons were tied into a knot that left the fringed end free. This established the basic design of the epaulette as it evolved through the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>John Mollo, page 49 \"Military Fashion\", {{ISBN|0-214-65349-8}}</ref>\n\nFrom the 18th century on, epaulettes were used in the French and other armies to indicate rank. The rank of an officer could be determined by whether an epaulette was worn on the left shoulder, the right shoulder, or on both. Later a \"counter-epaulette\" (with no fringe) was worn on the opposite shoulder of those who wore only a single epaulette. Epaulettes were made in [[silver]] or [[gold]] for officers and in cloth of various colors for the enlisted men of various arms.  Certain categories of cavalry wore flexible metal epaulettes referred to as shoulder scales, rarely worn on the field.\n\nBy the early 18th century, epaulettes had become the distinguishing feature of commissioned rank. This led officers of military units still without epaulettes to petition for the right to wear epaulettes to ensure that their status would be recognized.<ref>Wilkinson-Latham, R: ''The Royal Navy 1790\u20131970'', page 5. Osprey Publishing, 1977</ref>  \nDuring the Napoleonic Wars and subsequently through the 19th century, [[grenadiers]], [[light infantry]], [[voltigeurs]] and other specialist categories of infantry in many European armies wore cloth epaulettes with wool fringes in various colors to distinguish them from ordinary [[line infantry]]. \"Flying artillery\" wore \"wings\", similar to an epaulette but with only a bit of fringe on the outside, which matched the shoulder seam. Heavy [[artillery]] wore small balls representing [[ammunition]] on their shoulders.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAn intermediate form in some services, such as the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]], is the [[shoulder board]], which neither has a fringe nor extends beyond the shoulder seam. This originated during the 19th century as a simplified version for service wear of the heavy and conspicuous full dress epaulette with bullion fringes.\n\n==Modern derivations==\nToday, epaulettes have mostly been replaced by a five-sided flap of cloth called a [[shoulder board]], which is sewn into the shoulder seam and the end buttoned like an epaulette.\n\nFrom the shoulder board was developed the [[shoulder mark]], a flat cloth tube that is worn over the shoulder strap and carries embroidered or pinned-on rank insignia. The advantages of this are the ability to easily change the insignia as occasions warrant.\n\nAirline pilot uniform shirts generally include cloth flattened tubular epaulettes having cloth or bullion braid stripes, attached by shoulder straps integral to the shirts.  The rank of the wearer is designated by the number of stripes:  Traditionally four for captain, three for first officer (copilot), two for second officer (flight engineer). However, rank insignia are airline specific. For example, at some airlines, two stripes denote junior first officer and one stripe second officer (cruise or relief pilot).  Airline captains' uniform caps usually will have a braid pattern on the bill.\n\n== Belgium ==\n[[File:BELGICANA GRENADIERS CARABINIERS PRINCEPS BAUDOUIN.jpg|thumbnail|Belgian Grenadiers with red fringed epaulettes]]\n\nIn the Belgian army, red epaulettes with white fringes are worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the [[Belgian Royal Escort|Royal Escort]] while fully red ones are worn by the [[Grenadiers]]. Trumpeters of the Royal Escort are distinguished by all red epaulettes while officers of the two units wear silver or gold respectively.\n\n== Canada ==\n[[File:Messkit1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Canadian officers in mess dress or mess kit]]\n[[File:EpaulettesOfProvoWallisMaritimeCommandMuseum.JPG|thumb|Epaulettes of [[Provo Wallis]], [[Maritime Command Museum]], [[CFB Halifax]]]]\nIn the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], epaulettes are still worn on some Army [[Full dress|Full Dress]], [[Patrol Dress]], and [[Mess Dress]] uniforms. Epaulettes in the form of shoulder boards are worn with the officer's white Naval Service Dress. \n\nAfter the [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces|unification of the Forces]], and prior to the issue of the [[Uniforms of the Canadian Forces#Distinct Environmental Uniform|Distinct Environmental Uniforms]], musicians of the [[Band Branch (Canadian Forces)|Band Branch]] wore epaulettes of braided gold cord.\n\n== France ==\nUntil 1914, officers of most [[French Army]] infantry regiments wore gold epaulettes in full dress, while those of mounted units wore silver. No insignia was worn on the epaulette itself, though the bullion fringe falling from the crescent differed according to rank.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Jouineau, Officers and Soldiers of the French Army 1914, {{ISBN|978-2-352-50104-6}}</ref> Other ranks of most branches of the infantry, as well as [[cuirassier]]s wore detachable epaulettes of various colours (red for line infantry, green for [[Chasseur]]s, yellow for Colonial Infantry etc.) with woollen fringes, of a traditional pattern that dated back to the 18th Century. Other cavalry such as [[hussar]]s, [[dragoons]] and chasseurs \u00e0 cheval wore special epaulettes of a style originally intended to deflect sword blows from the shoulder.\n  \nIn the modern French Army, epaulettes are still worn by those units retaining 19th-century-style full dress uniforms, notably the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|ESM Saint-Cyr]] and the [[Garde R\u00e9publicaine]]. The [[French Foreign Legion]] continued to wear their green and red epaulettes, except for a break from 1915 to 1930. In recent years, the Marine Infantry and some other units have readopted their traditional fringed epaulettes in various colours for ceremonial parades. The [[Marine nationale]] and the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] do not use epaulettes, but non-commissioned and commissioned officers wear a gilded shoulder strap called ''attente''{{cn|date=July 2019}}, which  original function was to clip the epaulette onto the shoulder. The ''[[attentes]]''{{cn|date=July 2019}} are also worn by Army generals on dress uniform.\n{{see also|:Commons:Category:Attentes}}\n\n<gallery>\nImage:First Battalion ESM Bastille Day 2007 n2.jpg|Cadets of the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|ESM Saint-Cyr]] in full uniform.

For ranks up to and including captain these were \"scale\" epaulettes without fringes, for majors and colonels with fine fringes and for generals with a heavy fringe. The base of the epaulette was of regimental colors. For ordinary duty, dress \"shoulder-cords\" of silver braid intertwined with state colors, were worn.<ref>page 590, Volume XXVII, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition</ref>\n\nDuring the period 1919-45, [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] uniforms were known for a four cord braided \"figure-of-eight\" decoration which acted as a shoulder board for senior and general officers. This was called a \"shoulder knot\" and was in silver with the specialty color piping (for field officers) and silver with red border (for generals). Although it was once seen on US Army uniforms, it remains only in the [[Mess dress|mess uniform]]. A  similar form of shoulder knot was worn by officers of the [[British Army]] in full dress until 1914 and is retained by the [[Household Cavalry]] today. Epaulettes of this pattern are used by the [[Republic of Korea Army]]'s general officers and were widely worn by officers of the armies of Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador and Bolivia; all of which formerly wore uniforms closely following the Imperial German model. The Chilean Army still retains the German style of epaulette in the uniforms of its ceremonial units, the Military Academy and the NCO School while the 5th Cavalry Regiment \"Aca Caraya\" of the [[Paraguayan Army]] sports both epaulettes and shoulder knots in its dress uniforms (save for a platoon wearing [[Chaco War]] uniforms). Epaulettes of the German pattern (as well as shoulder knots) are used by officers of ceremonial units and schools of the [[Bolivian Army]].\n\n==Haiti==\nGold epaulettes in [[Haiti]], were frequently worn throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in full dress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-28YAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281&dq=haitian+army+gold+epaulettes&source=bl&ots=cTgM3AsFYh&sig=62Y2n1At4l57S5cyY4ov5ugZhy0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fOSoVJDyA4SngwTY4oH4Aw&ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=haitian%20army%20gold%20epaulettes&f=false |title=Education, Volume 23 |publisher=New England Publishing Company |page=281 |year=1903 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> During the [[Haitian Revolution]], Gen.

The epaulette was officially incorporated into Swedish uniform regulations in 1792, although foreign recruited regiments had had them earlier. Senior officers were to wear golden crowns to distinguish their rank from lower ranking officers who wore golden stars.\n\nEpaulettes were discontinued on the field uniform in the mid-19th century, switching to rank insignia on the collar of the uniform jacket. Epaulettes were discontinued when they were removed from the general issue [[Full dress#Military|dress uniform]] in the 1930s. They are, however, still worn by the Royal Lifeguards and by military bands when in ceremonial full dress.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:K1_Parad_5.jpg|Royal Lifeguards Officer in ceremonial full dress at the Royal Palace in Stockholm\nFile:King Oscar II of Sweden in uniform.png|Swedish king [[Oscar II]] wearing an admiral's uniform, as shown by the three stars on his epaulettes\n</gallery>\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:Epaulette mp3h7527.jpg|thumb|[[Shoulder mark]] of a contemporary British OG (Olive Green) pullover with RAF [[Sergeant]] insignia.

The epaulette was officially incorporated into [[Royal Navy]] uniform regulations in 1795, although some officers wore them before this date. Under this system, [[flag officer]]s wore silver stars on their epaulettes to distinguish their ranks. A [[Captain (naval)|captain]] with at least three years seniority had two plain epaulettes, while a junior captain wore one on the right shoulder, and a [[commander]] one on the left.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/search/lightbox.cfm/category/90266|title=Epaulettes at the National Maritime Museum website|work=NMM.ac.uk|access-date=30 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930034622/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/search/lightbox.cfm/category/90266|archive-date=30 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1855, army officers' large, gold-fringed epaulettes were abolished<ref>Major R.M. Barnes, page 260 \"A History of the Regiments and Uniforms of the British Army\", First Sphere Books edition 1972</ref> and replaced by a simplified equivalent officially known as twisted shoulder-cords.<ref>Section 24 \"Dress Regulations for the Army 1900</ref> These were generally worn with full dress uniforms until 1939. Naval officers retained the historic fringed epaulettes for full dress during this period.\n\nBritish cavalry on active service in the Sudan (1898) and during the [[Boer War]] (1899\u20131902) sometimes wore epaulettes made of [[chainmail]] to protect against sword blows landing on the shoulder. The blue \"Number 1 dress\" uniforms of some British cavalry regiments and [[yeomanry]] units still retain this feature in ornamental silvered form.<ref>R.M. Barnes page 316 \"Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire\", Sphere Books 1972</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902, the [[British Army]] stopped wearing epaulettes in the field, switching to rank insignia embroidered on the cuffs of the uniform jacket. During [[World War I]], this was found to make officers a target for snipers, so the insignia was frequently moved to the shoulder straps, where it was less conspicuous.\n\nThe current multi terrain pattern (MTP) and the older [[British Army uniform#No.8: Temperate combat dress|combat uniform]] (DPM) have the insignia formerly used on shoulder straps displayed on a single strap worn vertically in the centre of the chest. Earlier DPM uniforms had shoulder straps on the shoulders, though only officers wore rank on [[rank slides]] which attached to these straps, other ranks wore rank on the upper right sleeve at this time though later on [[regimental titles]] were worn on the rank slides. This practice continued into later patterns where rank was worn on the chest, rank was also added.\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:CharlesGriffin.jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen.

The rank insignia was of a contrasting metal, silver on gold and vice versa.\n\nIn 1851, the epaulettes became universally gold. Both majors and second lieutenants had no specific insignia. A major would have been recognizable as he would have worn the more elaborate epaulette fringes of a senior field officer. The rank insignia was silver for senior officers and gold for the bars of captains and first lieutenants. The reason for the choice of silver eagles over gold ones is thought to be one of economy; there were more cavalry and artillery colonels than infantry so it was cheaper to replace the numerically fewer gold ones.\n\nShoulder straps were adopted to replace epaulettes for field duty in 1836.\n\nLicensed officers of the [[U.S. Merchant Marine]] may wear [[shoulder marks]] and sleeve stripes appropriate to their rank and branch of service. Deck officers wear a foul anchor above the stripes on their shoulder marks and engineering officers wear a three-bladed propeller.

With support from the General Staff and the [[Wilhelmstrasse]], he established the [[German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews]], together with 6 German Zionist colleagues, on 17 August 1914. He resigned his chairmanship of the Jewish National Fund. Bodenheimer wanted the German army to assault the power of the Tsarist empire in the Baltic States, Poland, [[Belorussia|White Russia]] and the Ukraine, where he hoped for an 'East European Federation' in which 'all ethnic groups were to enjoy national autonomy', including the Jews, in the [[Pale of Settlement]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMeekin|first1=Sean|title=The Berlin-Baghdad express : the Ottoman Empire and Germany's bid for world power|date=2012|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0674064321|pages=344 &ndash; 345|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=6k5HzkboGvcC&dq=Sean+McMeekin,+The+Berlin-Baghdad+Express&source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}</ref> It seems like he was the author of the conception of the establishment of the [[League of East European States]] - a German client state with autonomous Jewish cooperation, later referred also as [[Judeopolonia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kki.pl/piojar/polemiki/land/land3.html|website=kki.pl|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222000659/http://www.kki.pl/piojar/polemiki/land/land3.html|archivedate=22 December 2007|language=en|title=Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski Jews in Poland - New York 1998, p. 297|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLike other veterans from the Herzl period, Bodenheimer\u2019s status declined after the First World War, and he was not re-elected as a member of the Board of Directors of the JNF. In August 1929, joins the Revisionist party led by [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]]. Bodenheimer attended the 17th [[Zionist Congress]] as a representative of the Revisionist party. During the Congress, a sharp controversy arose between the majority and the Revisionist party concerning the \"ultimate goal\" of Zionism, and the Revisionists left the Congress. This was the last Zionist Congress in which Bodenheimer participated.\n\nIn 1935 Bodenheimer immigrated to Palestine and settled in [[Jerusalem]], where he began writing his [[memoirs]]. He died in July 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zionism-israel.com/bio/Max_Bodenheimer.htm|website=zionism-israel.com|language=en|title=Max Bodenheimer Biography|date=21 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n* Prelude to Israel.

Though this threat was dealt with relatively quickly, the instability caused by the brief civil war may be what made it possible for another general, [[Nabopolassar]], to rise up and seize power in [[Babylonia]]. Sinsharishkun's inability to defeat Nabopolassar, despite repeated attempts over the course of several years, allowed Nabopolassar to consolidate power and form the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule.\n\nThe Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed [[Median empire|Median Empire]] under King [[Cyaxares]], then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked and razed [[Nineveh]], the Assyrian capital. Sinsharishkun's fate is unknown but it is assumed that he died in the defense of his capital. He was succeeded as king only by [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son, who rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at the city of [[Harran]].\n\n== Background and chronology ==\nThe period from a few years before the death of King [[Ashurbanipal]] to the [[Fall of Nineveh]] in 612 BC suffers from a distinct lack of surviving sources. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=121}}'' Although Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}''', this follows an inscription at [[Harran]] made by the mother of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] king [[Nabonidus]] nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of [[Nippur]] made in 631 BC.'''{{Sfn|Reade|1970|p=1}}''' To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} If Ashurbanipal's reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and Sinsharishkun in [[Babylon]], covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=246}}\n\nAshurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince (probably Ashur-etil-ilani) were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=|pp=122\u2013123}}'' Ashur-etil-ilani succeeded Ashurbanipal as king in 631 BC and ruled until his own death in 627 BC. It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Sinsharishkun fought with Ashur-etil-ilani for the throne.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=126}}''\n\nSinsharishkun has sometimes historically and erroneously been known as ''Esarhaddon II'' after a letter written by [[Serua-eterat]], a daughter of Sinsharishkun's grandfather King [[Esarhaddon]]. The chronology and relations of the royal family were uncertain and Serua-eterat was believed to have been too young to refer to the famous Esarhaddon. The idea of a separate Esarhaddon II as king has been abandoned by Assyriologists since the late 19th century,''{{Sfn|Johnston|1899|p=244}}'' but the name sometimes appears as a synonym of Sinsharishkun.'''''{{Sfn|Woodall|2018|p=108}}{{Sfn|Myers|1890|p=51}}'''''\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rise to the throne and revolt of Sin-shumu-lishir ===\nIn the middle of 627 BC, King Ashurbanipal's son and successor Ashur-etil-ilani died, leading to Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun ascending to the Assyrian throne.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Although it has been suggested by several historians, there is no evidence to prove the idea that Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed in a coup by his brother. Sinsharishkun's inscriptions state that he was selected for the kingship from among several of \"his equals\" (i.e., his brothers) by the gods.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=255}}''\n\nAlso dying at roughly the same time as Ashur-etil-ilani was the vassal king of Babylon, [[Kandalanu]], which led to Sinsharishkun also becoming the ruler of Babylon, as proven by inscriptions by him in southern cities such as Nippur, [[Uruk]], [[Sippar]] and Babylon itself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}'' Sinsharishkun's rule of Babylon did not last long, and almost immediately in the wake of him coming to the throne, the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] rebelled.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Sin-shumu-lishir had been a key figure in Assyria during Ashur-etil-ilani's reign, putting down several revolts and possibly being the ''de facto'' leader of the country. The rise of another king might have endangered his position and as such led him to revolt and attempt to seize power for himself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}''\n\nSin-shumu-lishir successfully seized control of some cities in northern [[Babylonia]], including Nippur and Babylon itself and would rule there for three months before Sinsharishkun defeated him.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Though both of them exercised control there, neither Sinsharishkun nor Sin-shumu-lishir officially claimed the title \"King of Babylon\" (only using \"King of Assyria\"), meaning that Babylonia experienced an interregnum of sorts.{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}}\n\n=== Rise of Babylon ===\n{{Main|Revolt of Babylon (626 BC)}}\n[[File:Meso2mil-English.JPG|left|thumb|Locations of some major [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] cities.]]\nSome months after Sin-shumu-lishir's revolt, another revolt began in Babylon. A general called Nabopolassar, possibly using the political instability caused by the previous revolt{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} and the ongoing interregnum in the south,{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}} assaulted both Nippur and Babylon.{{refn|It is also possible that Nabopolassar was an ally of Sin-shumu-lishir in the previous revolt and merely continued his rebellion, but this theory requires more assumptions without any concrete evidence.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}|group=\"n\"}} Nabopolassar's armies took the cities from the garrisons left there by Sinsharishkun but the Assyrian response was swift and in October of 626 BC, the Assyrian army recaptured Nippur and besieged Nabopolassar at Uruk. A simultaneous Assyrian attempt at recapturing Babylon itself, the last ever Assyrian action against the city, was repulsed by Nabopolassar's garrison and the attack at Uruk also failed.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned [[King of Babylon]] on November 22/23 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}} In 625\u2013623 BC, Sinsharishkun's forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. Initially, these campaigns were successful; in 625 BC the Assyrians took the city of Sippar and Nabopolassar's attempted reconquest of Nippur failed. Another of Assyria's vassals, [[Elam]], also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as [[Der (Sumer)|Der]], revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sinsharishkun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}}\n\nSinsharishkun might have ultimately been victorious had it not been for another revolt, led by an Assyrian general in the empire's western provinces in 622 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sinsharishkun and the Assyrian army to march on Nineveh, met a hastily organized army which surrendered without fighting and successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=263}}'' Understandably alarmed by this development, Sinsharishkun abandoned his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper after a hundred days of civil war, the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622\u2013620 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly in Nabopolassar's hands by 620 BC. Nippur was also conquered in 620 BC and Nabopolassar consolidated his rule over the entirety of Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}}\n\n=== Fall of the Assyrian Empire ===\n{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire}}\n[[File:Fall of nineveh.jpg|thumb|''Fall of Nineveh'' by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1829).]]\nThe next few years saw repeated Babylonian victories against the Assyrians. By 616 BC, Nabopolassar's armies had reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Realizing that the situation was dire, Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], marched his troops to aid Sinsharishkun. Psamtik had over the last few years campaigned to establish dominance over the small city-states of the [[Levant]] and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}} A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of [[Gablinu]] was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in failure after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the [[Euphrates]], only offering limited support.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}}\n\nFollowing this failure, Assyria quickly collapsed. In March 615 BC, Nabopolassar inflicted a crushing defeat on the Assyrian army at the banks of the [[Tigris]], pushing them back to the [[Little Zab]]. Although Nabopolassar's attempt at taking the city of [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria, in May of that same year failed and he retreated to the city of [[Tikrit|Takrit]], the Assyrians also failed to assault Takrit and put an end to him. After yet another failure, the Assyrian army returned to Assur. In October or November 615 BC, the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]] entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city [[Arrapha]] in preparation for a great final campaign against Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}} \n\nIn July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of [[Kalhu]] and [[Nineveh]] and successfully conquered the city [[Tarbisu]]. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. Shortly after Assur's fall, Sinsharishkun made his last attempt at a counterattack, rushing to rescue the besieged city of [[Rahilu]], but Nabopolassar's army had retreated before a battle could take place.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} \n\nIn April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar's fourteenth year as King of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. From June to August of that year, they besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|lengthy and brutal sack]].{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Sinsharishkun's fate is not entirely certain but it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.'''{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}}{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}'''\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Succession ===\n{{See also|Ashur-uballit II}}\n[[File:Alter Orient 0600BC.svg|thumb|Political map of the [[Near East]] ~600 BC. In the aftermath of its fall, the territory of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] was divided between the Neo-Babylonian and [[Median empire|Median Empires]].]]\nWith the destructions of Assur in 614 BC and Nineveh in 612 BC, the Assyrian empire had essentially ceased to exist.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}} Sinsharishkun was succeeded by another Assyrian king, [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son and probably the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at Nineveh from 626 and 623 BC. Ashur-uballit established himself in Harran in the west.{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}} Because Assur had been destroyed, Ashur-uballit could not undergo the traditional coronation of the Assyrian monarchs and could thus not be invested with the kingship by the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and because of this, inscriptions from his brief reign indicate that he was viewed as the legitimate ruler by his subjects, but still with the title of crown prince and not king. To the Assyrians, Sinsharishkun was the last true king.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\nAshur-uballit's rule at Harran lasted just three years and he fled the city when Nabopolassar's army approached in 610 BC.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}{{Sfn|Bassir|2018|p=198}}''' An attempt at [[Siege of Harran|recapturing]] Harran carried out with the remnants of the Assyrian army and Egyptian reinforcements in 609 BC failed, after which Ashur-uballit and the Assyrians he commanded disappear from history, never again to be mentioned in Babylonian sources.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=141}}{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}}\n\nThe [[Biblical]] [[Book of Nahum]] \"prophetically\" discusses the Fall of Nineveh, but it is unclear when it was written. It may have been written as early as during Ashurbanipal's Egyptian campaign in the 660s BC, or as late as around the time of Nineveh's actual fall. If it was written around 612 BC, the \"king of Assyria\" mentioned would be Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Walton|Matthews|p=791|Chavalas|2012}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.|author=|title=|source=[[Nahum]] 3:18, [[New International Version]]{{Sfn|Nahum 3:18||p=}}}}\n\n=== Reasons for the Fall of Assyria ===\nAlthough it has been a commonly circulated idea that one of the primary reasons that led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was a civil war between Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun over the throne which weakened Assyria, there is no contemporary text which suggests that this is true. No inscriptions mention a war or even a dispute between the two brothers. There were revolts at the beginnings of both the reign of Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun, but these were minor and dealt with relatively quickly. As such, protracted civil war between contenders to the Assyrian throne was probably not the reason for Assyria's fall.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=265}}''\n\nThe primary reason for Assyria's collapse in the reign of Sinsharishkun is more likely to be the failure to resolve the \"Babylonian problem\" which had plagued Assyrian kings since Assyria first conquered southern Mesopotamia. Despite the many attempts of the kings of the [[Sargonid dynasty]] to resolve the constant rebellions in the south in a variety of different ways; [[Sennacherib]]'s destruction of Babylon and [[Esarhaddon]]'s restoration of it, rebellions and insurrections remained common. Nabopolassar's revolt was the last in a long line of Babylonian uprisings against the Assyrians and Sinsharishkun's failure to stop it, despite trying for years, doomed his kingdom. The Neo-Babylonian threat, combined with the rise of the Median Empire (Assyria had for many years attempted to stop the formation of a unified Median state through repeated campaigns into Media) culminated in Assyria's destruction.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=266}}''\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}\nFrom one of his inscriptions commemorating his building projects at Nineveh,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}} Sinsharishkun's titles read as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, [[king of the Universe]], ''[missing portion]'' chosen of Ashur and Ninlil, beloved of Marduk and Sarpanitum, dear to the heart of ''[missing portion]'', the sure choice of the heart of Nabu and Marduk, favorite of ''[missing portion]'', whom Ashur, Ninlil, B\u00eal, Nabu, Sin, Nin-gal, Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela in the midst of his companions looked upon with sure favor and called his name for the kingship; whom they named in every metropolis, for the priesthood of every sanctuary and for the rule of all the people, to whose aid they kept coming, like his father and mother, slaying his enemies and bringing low his opponents, ''[missing portion]'' whom they created for the rulership of the universe and crowned with the crown of rulership among all ''[missing portion]'', for the guidance of his subjects, into whose hand Nabu, guardian of all things, placed a righteous scepter and a just staff ''[missing portion]''{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}}}}\n\nIn another inscription, commemorating his restoration of a temple, Sinsharishkun incorporates his ancestry:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, son of Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, [[king of Sumer and Akkad]], grandson of [[Esarhaddon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, great-grandson of [[Sennacherib]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, the unrivaled prince, descendant of [[Sargon II|Sargon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=413}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sargonid dynasty]]\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibF6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Sin-apla-iddina|title=Southern Mesopotamia in the time of Ashurbanipal|last=Ahmed|first=Sami Said|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3111033587|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFAhmed2018}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Bassir|first=Hussein|date=2018|title=The Egyptian expansion in the near east in the saite period|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52c/14c7ebc70abf1c2053fa944135cb51d6cd87.pdf|journal=Journal of Historical Archaeology & Anthropological Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013200|ref=CITEREFBassir2018|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Beaulieu|first=Paul-Alain|date=1997|title=The Fourth Year of Hostilities in the Land|url=https://www.academia.edu/1821361/The_Fourth_Year_of_Hostilities_in_the_Land|journal=Baghdader Mitteilungen|volume=28|issue=|pages=367\u2013394|ref=CITEREFBeaulieu1997|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/1011803|title=Von Babylon bis Jerusalem: Die Welt der altorientalischen K\u00f6nigsst\u00e4dte|last=Frahm|first=Eckhart|publisher=Reiss-Museum Mannheim|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Kabale und Liebe: Die k\u00f6nigliche Familie am Hof zu Ninive|ref=CITEREFFrahm1999}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Christopher|date=1899|title=A Recent Interpretation of the Letter of an Assyrian Princess|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=20|issue=|pages=244\u2013249|ref=CITEREFJohnston1899|jstor=592332|doi=10.2307/592332}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&f=true|title=The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule|last=Lipschits|first=Oled|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2005|isbn=978-1575060958|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLipschits2005}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/ancient-records-assyria-and-babylonia-volume-2-historical-records-assyria|title=Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia Volume 2: Historical Records of Assyria From Sargon to the End|last=Luckenbill|first=Daniel David|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1927|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLuckenbill1927}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:A_general_history_for_colleges_and_high_schools_(Myers,_1890).djvu/69|title=A General History for Colleges and High Schools|last=Myers|first=P.

Though this threat was dealt with relatively quickly, the instability caused by the brief civil war may be what made it possible for another general, [[Nabopolassar]], to rise up and seize power in [[Babylonia]]. Sinsharishkun's inability to defeat Nabopolassar, despite repeated attempts over the course of several years, allowed Nabopolassar to consolidate power and form the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule.\n\nThe Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed [[Median empire|Median Empire]] under King [[Cyaxares]], then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked and razed [[Nineveh]], the Assyrian capital. Sinsharishkun's fate is unknown but it is assumed that he died in the defense of his capital. He was succeeded as king only by [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son, who rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at the city of [[Harran]].\n\n== Background and chronology ==\nThe period from a few years before the death of King [[Ashurbanipal]] to the [[Fall of Nineveh]] in 612 BC suffers from a distinct lack of surviving sources. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=121}}'' Although Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC'''{{Sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica||p=}}{{Sfn|Mark|2009|p=}}''', this follows an inscription at [[Harran]] made by the mother of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] king [[Nabonidus]] nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of [[Nippur]] made in 631 BC.'''{{Sfn|Reade|1970|p=1}}''' To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=263}} Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted.{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=8}} If Ashurbanipal's reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and Sinsharishkun in [[Babylon]], covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=246}}\n\nAshurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince (probably Ashur-etil-ilani) were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=|pp=122\u2013123}}'' Ashur-etil-ilani succeeded Ashurbanipal as king in 631 BC and ruled until his own death in 627 BC. It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Sinsharishkun fought with Ashur-etil-ilani for the throne.''{{Sfn|Ahmed|2018|p=126}}''\n\nSinsharishkun has sometimes historically and erroneously been known as ''Esarhaddon II'' after a letter written by [[Serua-eterat]], a daughter of Sinsharishkun's grandfather King [[Esarhaddon]]. The chronology and relations of the royal family were uncertain and Serua-eterat was believed to have been too young to refer to the famous Esarhaddon. The idea of a separate Esarhaddon II as king has been abandoned by Assyriologists since the late 19th century,''{{Sfn|Johnston|1899|p=244}}'' but the name sometimes appears as a synonym of Sinsharishkun.'''''{{Sfn|Woodall|2018|p=108}}{{Sfn|Myers|1890|p=51}}'''''\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rise to the throne and revolt of Sin-shumu-lishir ===\nIn the middle of 627 BC, King Ashurbanipal's son and successor Ashur-etil-ilani died, leading to Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun ascending to the Assyrian throne.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Although it has been suggested by several historians, there is no evidence to prove the idea that Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed in a coup by his brother. Sinsharishkun's inscriptions state that he was selected for the kingship from among several of \"his equals\" (i.e., his brothers) by the gods.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=255}}''\n\nAlso dying at roughly the same time as Ashur-etil-ilani was the vassal king of Babylon, [[Kandalanu]], which led to Sinsharishkun also becoming the ruler of Babylon, as proven by inscriptions by him in southern cities such as Nippur, [[Uruk]], [[Sippar]] and Babylon itself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}'' Sinsharishkun's rule of Babylon did not last long, and almost immediately in the wake of him coming to the throne, the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] rebelled.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Sin-shumu-lishir had been a key figure in Assyria during Ashur-etil-ilani's reign, putting down several revolts and possibly being the ''de facto'' leader of the country. The rise of another king might have endangered his position and as such led him to revolt and attempt to seize power for himself.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}''\n\nSin-shumu-lishir successfully seized control of some cities in northern [[Babylonia]], including Nippur and Babylon itself and would rule there for three months before Sinsharishkun defeated him.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} Though both of them exercised control there, neither Sinsharishkun nor Sin-shumu-lishir officially claimed the title \"King of Babylon\" (only using \"King of Assyria\"), meaning that Babylonia experienced an interregnum of sorts.{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}}\n\n=== Rise of Babylon ===\n{{Main|Revolt of Babylon (626 BC)}}\n[[File:Meso2mil-English.JPG|left|thumb|Locations of some major [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] cities.]]\nSome months after Sin-shumu-lishir's revolt, another revolt began in Babylon. A general called Nabopolassar, possibly using the political instability caused by the previous revolt{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}} and the ongoing interregnum in the south,{{Sfn|Beaulieu|1997|p=386}} assaulted both Nippur and Babylon.{{refn|It is also possible that Nabopolassar was an ally of Sin-shumu-lishir in the previous revolt and merely continued his rebellion, but this theory requires more assumptions without any concrete evidence.{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=256}}|group=\"n\"}} Nabopolassar's armies took the cities from the garrisons left there by Sinsharishkun but the Assyrian response was swift and in October of 626 BC, the Assyrian army recaptured Nippur and besieged Nabopolassar at Uruk. A simultaneous Assyrian attempt at recapturing Babylon itself, the last ever Assyrian action against the city, was repulsed by Nabopolassar's garrison and the attack at Uruk also failed.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned [[King of Babylon]] on November 22/23 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=14}} In 625\u2013623 BC, Sinsharishkun's forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. Initially, these campaigns were successful; in 625 BC the Assyrians took the city of Sippar and Nabopolassar's attempted reconquest of Nippur failed. Another of Assyria's vassals, [[Elam]], also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as [[Der (Sumer)|Der]], revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sinsharishkun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}}\n\nSinsharishkun might have ultimately been victorious had it not been for another revolt, led by an Assyrian general in the empire's western provinces in 622 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sinsharishkun and the Assyrian army to march on Nineveh, met a hastily organized army which surrendered without fighting and successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=263}}'' Understandably alarmed by this development, Sinsharishkun abandoned his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper after a hundred days of civil war, the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622\u2013620 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=15}} The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly in Nabopolassar's hands by 620 BC. Nippur was also conquered in 620 BC and Nabopolassar consolidated his rule over the entirety of Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}}\n\n=== Fall of the Assyrian Empire ===\n{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire}}\n[[File:Fall of nineveh.jpg|thumb|''Fall of Nineveh'' by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] (1829).]]\nThe next few years saw repeated Babylonian victories against the Assyrians. By 616 BC, Nabopolassar's armies had reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Realizing that the situation was dire, Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], marched his troops to aid Sinsharishkun. Psamtik had over the last few years campaigned to establish dominance over the small city-states of the [[Levant]] and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}} A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of [[Gablinu]] was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in failure after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the [[Euphrates]], only offering limited support.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}}\n\nFollowing this failure, Assyria quickly collapsed. In March 615 BC, Nabopolassar inflicted a crushing defeat at the Assyrian army at the banks of the [[Tigris]], pushing them back to the [[Little Zab]]. Although Nabopolassar's attempt at taking the city of [[Assur]], the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria, in May of that same year failed and he retreated to the city of [[Tikrit|Takrit]], the Assyrians also failed to assault Takrit and put an end to him. After yet another failure, the Assyrian army returned to Assur. In October or November 615 BC, the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]] entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city [[Arrapha]] in preparation for a great final campaign against Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=17}} \n\nIn July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of [[Kalhu]] and [[Nineveh]] and successfully conquered the city [[Tarbisu]]. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. Shortly after Assur's fall, Sinsharishkun made his last attempt at a counterattack, rushing to rescue the besieged city of [[Rahilu]], but Nabopolassar's army had retreated before a battle could take place.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} \n\nIn April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar's fourteenth year as King of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. From June to August of that year, they besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|lengthy and brutal sack]].{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Sinsharishkun's fate is not entirely certain but it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.'''{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}}{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}'''\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Succession ===\n{{See also|Ashur-uballit II}}\n[[File:Alter Orient 0600BC.svg|thumb|Political map of the [[Near East]] ~600 BC. In the aftermath of its fall, the territory of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] was divided between the Neo-Babylonian and [[Median empire|Median Empires]].]]\nWith the destructions of Assur in 614 BC and Nineveh in 612 BC, the Assyrian empire had essentially ceased to exist.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}} Sinsharishkun was succeeded by another Assyrian king, [[Ashur-uballit II]], possibly his son and probably the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at Nineveh from 626 and 623 BC. Ashur-uballit established himself in Harran in the west.{{Sfn|Yildirim|2017|p=52}} Because Assur had been destroyed, Ashur-uballit could not undergo the traditional coronation of the Assyrian monarchs and could thus not be invested with the kingship by the god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and because of this, inscriptions from his brief reign indicate that he was viewed as the legitimate ruler by his subjects, but still with the title of crown prince and not king. To the Assyrians, Sinsharishkun was the last true king.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\nAshur-uballit's rule at Harran lasted just three years and he fled the city when Nabopolassar's army approached in 610 BC.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}{{Sfn|Bassir|2018|p=198}}''' An attempt at [[Siege of Harran|recapturing]] Harran carried out with the remnants of the Assyrian army and Egyptian reinforcements in 609 BC failed, after which Ashur-uballit and the Assyrians he commanded disappear from history, never again to be mentioned in Babylonian sources.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=141}}{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}}\n\nThe [[Biblical]] [[Book of Nahum]] \"prophetically\" discusses the Fall of Nineveh, but it is unclear when it was written. It may have been written as early as during Ashurbanipal's Egyptian campaign in the 660s BC, or as late as around the time of Nineveh's actual fall. If it was written around 612 BC, the \"king of Assyria\" mentioned would be Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Walton|Matthews|p=791|Chavalas|2012}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber; your nobles lie down to rest. Your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them.|author=|title=|source=[[Nahum]] 3:18, [[New International Version]]{{Sfn|Nahum 3:18||p=}}}}\n\n=== Reasons for the Fall of Assyria ===\nAlthough it has been a commonly circulated idea that one of the primary reasons that led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was a civil war between Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun over the throne which weakened Assyria, there is no contemporary text which suggests that this is true. No inscriptions mention a war or even a dispute between the two brothers. There were revolts at the beginnings of both the reign of Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun, but these were minor and dealt with relatively quickly. As such, protracted civil war between contenders to the Assyrian throne was probably not the reason for Assyria's fall.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=265}}''\n\nThe primary reason for Assyria's collapse in the reign of Sinsharishkun is more likely to be the failure to resolve the \"Babylonian problem\" which had plagued Assyrian kings since Assyria first conquered southern Mesopotamia. Despite the many attempts of the kings of the [[Sargonid dynasty]] to resolve the constant rebellions in the south in a variety of different ways; [[Sennacherib]]'s destruction of Babylon and [[Esarhaddon]]'s restoration of it, rebellions and insurrections remained common. Nabopolassar's revolt was the last in a long line of Babylonian uprisings against the Assyrians and Sinsharishkun's failure to stop it, despite trying for years, doomed his kingdom. The Neo-Babylonian threat, combined with the rise of the Median Empire (Assyria had for many years attempted to stop the formation of a unified Median state through repeated campaigns into Media) culminated in Assyria's destruction.''{{Sfn|Na\u2019aman|1991|p=266}}''\n\n== Titles ==\n{{See also|Akkadian royal titulary}}\nFrom one of his inscriptions commemorating his building projects at Nineveh,{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}} Sinsharishkun's titles read as follows:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, [[king of the Universe]], ''[missing portion]'' chosen of Ashur and Ninlil, beloved of Marduk and Sarpanitum, dear to the heart of ''[missing portion]'', the sure choice of the heart of Nabu and Marduk, favorite of ''[missing portion]'', whom Ashur, Ninlil, B\u00eal, Nabu, Sin, Nin-gal, Ishtar of Nineveh, Ishtar of Arbela in the midst of his companions looked upon with sure favor and called his name for the kingship; whom they named in every metropolis, for the priesthood of every sanctuary and for the rule of all the people, to whose aid they kept coming, like his father and mother, slaying his enemies and bringing low his opponents, ''[missing portion]'' whom they created for the rulership of the universe and crowned with the crown of rulership among all ''[missing portion]'', for the guidance of his subjects, into whose hand Nabu, guardian of all things, placed a righteous scepter and a just staff ''[missing portion]''{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=410}}}}\n\nIn another inscription, commemorating his restoration of a temple, Sinsharishkun incorporates his ancestry:\n\n{{Quote| quote = Sinsharishkun, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, son of Ashurbanipal, the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, [[king of Sumer and Akkad]], grandson of [[Esarhaddon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, great-grandson of [[Sennacherib]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, the unrivaled prince, descendant of [[Sargon II|Sargon]], the great king, the mighty king, king of the Universe, king of Assyria, viceroy of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad.{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1927|p=413}}}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sargonid dynasty]]\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibF6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Sin-apla-iddina|title=Southern Mesopotamia in the time of Ashurbanipal|last=Ahmed|first=Sami Said|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|year=2018|isbn=978-3111033587|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFAhmed2018}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Bassir|first=Hussein|date=2018|title=The Egyptian expansion in the near east in the saite period|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52c/14c7ebc70abf1c2053fa944135cb51d6cd87.pdf|journal=Journal of Historical Archaeology & Anthropological Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013200|ref=CITEREFBassir2018|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Beaulieu|first=Paul-Alain|date=1997|title=The Fourth Year of Hostilities in the Land|url=https://www.academia.edu/1821361/The_Fourth_Year_of_Hostilities_in_the_Land|journal=Baghdader Mitteilungen|volume=28|issue=|pages=367\u2013394|ref=CITEREFBeaulieu1997|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/1011803|title=Von Babylon bis Jerusalem: Die Welt der altorientalischen K\u00f6nigsst\u00e4dte|last=Frahm|first=Eckhart|publisher=Reiss-Museum Mannheim|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Kabale und Liebe: Die k\u00f6nigliche Familie am Hof zu Ninive|ref=CITEREFFrahm1999}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Christopher|date=1899|title=A Recent Interpretation of the Letter of an Assyrian Princess|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=20|issue=|pages=244\u2013249|ref=CITEREFJohnston1899|jstor=592332|doi=10.2307/592332}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&f=true|title=The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule|last=Lipschits|first=Oled|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2005|isbn=978-1575060958|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLipschits2005}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/misc/ancient-records-assyria-and-babylonia-volume-2-historical-records-assyria|title=Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia Volume 2: Historical Records of Assyria From Sargon to the End|last=Luckenbill|first=Daniel David|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1927|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLuckenbill1927}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:A_general_history_for_colleges_and_high_schools_(Myers,_1890).djvu/69|title=A General History for Colleges and High Schools|last=Myers|first=P.

{"title_page": "Cleanness", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{distinguish|Cleanliness}}\n'''''Cleanness''''' ([[Middle English]]: ''Clannesse'') is a [[Middle English]] [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[poem]] written in the late 14th century. Its unknown author, designated the ''[[Pearl poet]]'' or ''[[Gawain poet]]'', also appears, on the basis of dialect and stylistic evidence, to be the author of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', and ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', and may have also composed ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]''. \n\nThe poem is found solely in the Pearl manuscript, ''[[Cotton library|Cotton Nero A x]]''.  That manuscript also contains ''Pearl'', ''Patience'', and ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. None of the poems has a title or divisions of chapters, but the breaks are marked by large initial letters of blue, and there are twelve illustrations (or illuminations) contained within the manuscript, depicting scenes from the four poems.  Each of these poems is entirely unique to this one manuscript. ''Cleanness'' (which is an editorial title) is also known by the editorial title ''Purity''.\n\nThe manuscript, [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Cotton Nero A.x]] is in the [[British Library]]. The first published edition was in ''Early English Alliterative Poems in the West Midland Dialect of the fourteenth century'', printed by the [[Early English Text Society]].\n\n''Cleanness'' is a description of the virtues of cleanliness of body and the delights of married love.  It takes three subjects from the [[Bible]] as its illustrations: the [[Flood]], the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and the fall of [[Belshazzar]].  Each of these is described powerfully, and the poetry is among the finest in Middle English.  In each case, the poet warns his readers about the dangers of defilement and the joys of purity.\n\n== Genre and poetics ==\nA [[didactic]], [[homiletic]] poem, ''Cleanness'' consists of 1812 lines.  [[Alliteration]] is used consistently throughout the poem, usually with three alliterating words per line.  The unidentified narrator or preacher speaks in the first person throughout the work.\nIt is an exemplum from the perspective of many.\n\n==Narrative==\nThe opening lines of the poem (ll. 1\u201350) function as a [[peroration]] in which the narrator states his theme by contrasting cleanness and purity with filth.  He also points out that God hates filth and banishes those who are not properly dressed.\n\nA paraphrase of the [[Parable of the Great Banquet]] follows in lines 51\u2013171.  This [[exemplum]], explained by lines 171\u2013192,  follows directly from the previous sartorial [[metaphor]] and serves to show why the hearers should give attention to cleanness.  Following this, lines 193\u2013556 expound on God's forgiveness and wrath, using the Fall of the Angels,  the Fall of Adam and Eve (Gen 3), and the story of Noah (Gen 6: 5\u201332, 7, 8) (the first major [[exemplum]] of the poem) to demonstrate these divine attributes.\n\nA transition (ll. 557\u2013599), including a comment on how God reacts to sin (esp. lechery), follows.\n\nIn a second exemplum, the poet retells the stories of [[Abraham]] and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] (Gen. 18:1\u201319, 28) (ll. 600 - 1048), including a description of the [[Dead Sea]] as the poet understood it.\n\nIn another transition (ll. 1050\u20131148), the narrator explains the symbolism of the second exemplum, ending with a description of God as strongly vengeful.\n\nThe third, and by far the longest, [[exemplum]] (ll. 1149\u20131796) recounts the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and the transfer of the Temple treasures to [[Babylon]] where they were treated with reverence by the king.  But after Nebuchadnezzar died, Belshazzar, a man given to the indulgence of his lusts, succeeded him.  During an enormous drunken feast, he ordered that the Temple vessels be brought in and that everyone be served in them.  God then determines to punish him. A huge hand appears, writes a message on the wall, and vanishes. No one can interpret this message.  At the Queen's suggestion, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] is called, and he interprets the three words and predicts Belshazzar's downfall.\n\nIn his conclusion (ll. 1797\u20131812), the narrator summarizes by arguing that uncleanness angers God, and cleanness comforts Him.\n\n==Author==\n{{main|Pearl Poet}}\nThough the real name of \"The ''Pearl'' Poet\" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him or her can be drawn from an informed reading of his/her works. The original manuscript is known in academic circles as ''Cotton Nero A.x'', following a naming system used by one of its owners, [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], a collector of Medieval English texts.<ref name =ucalgary>{{cite web | title = Web Resources for Pearl-poet Study: A Vetted Selection | publisher = Univ. of Calgary | url = https://www.ucalgary.ca/~scriptor/cotton/blog.html | accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> Before the manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Henry Savile]] of Bank in [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Pearl: Introduction | publisher = Medieval Institute Publications, Inc. | year = 2001 | url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/pearlint.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of [[Thomas Warton]]'s ''History'' edited by [[Richard Price (British historian)|Richard Price]], it was almost entirely unknown.<ref>Turville-Petre, Thorlac.

''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Medieval Period'', Vol. 1., ed. Joseph Black, ''et al.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, Introduction, p.&nbsp;235. {{ISBN|1-55111-609-X}}</ref> The three other works found in the same manuscript as ''Pearl'' (commonly known as ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', and ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'') are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single-authorship.<ref name = poet>Nelles, William. \"The Pearl-Poet\". ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'', Fourth Revised Edition Database: MagillOnLiterature Plus, 1958.</ref>\n\nWhat is known today about the poet is largely general. As [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon]], after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\n{{quote|He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.<ref name = Tolkien>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Edited J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, revised Norman Davis, 1925. introduction, xv. ASIN B000IPU84U</ref>}}\n\nThe most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire.<ref>Peterson, Clifford J. \"The Pearl-Poet and John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire\". ''The Review of English Studies, New Series''. (1974) 25.99 pp.&nbsp;257\u2013266.</ref> He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem, ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to ''Gawain''. ''St. Erkenwald'', however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.<ref name = poet/>\n\n==Technique==\nIt uses the homiletic principles of education with entertainment ([[Horace]]'s ''utile et dulce'') and is primarily rooted in Biblical stories.  The reference to the [[Fallen angel|fall of the angel]]s is drawn from [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigrapha]].  The technique of presenting exempla and then explicating them as demonstrations of moral principles is characteristic of many sermons of the medieval period.  Here the poet uses three exempla with explication in the transitions between them.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Editions===\n*Andrew, Malcolm and Waldron, Ronald. 2002.

However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single-authorship.<ref name = poet>Nelles, William. \"The Pearl-Poet\". ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'', Fourth Revised Edition Database: MagillOnLiterature Plus, 1958.</ref>\n\nWhat is known today about the poet is largely general. As [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon]], after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\n{{quote|He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.<ref name = Tolkien>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Edited J.R.R.

''The Review of English Studies, New Series''. (1974) 25.99 pp.&nbsp;257\u2013266.</ref> He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem, ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to ''Gawain''. ''St. Erkenwald'', however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.<ref name = poet/>\n\n==Technique==\nIt uses the homiletic principles of education with entertainment ([[Horace]]'s ''utile et dulce'') and is primarily rooted in Biblical stories.  The reference to the [[Fallen angel|fall of the angel]]s is drawn from [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigrapha]].  The technique of presenting exempla and then explicating them as demonstrations of moral principles is characteristic of many sermons of the medieval period.  Here the poet uses three exempla with explication in the transitions between them.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Editions===\n*Andrew, Malcolm and Waldron, Ronald. 2002.

In that letter, he applied mathematics to the records of deaths during a recent [[smallpox]] epidemic, proposing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"If the latent cause of epidemics cannot be discovered, the mode in which it operates may be investigated.  The laws of its action may be determined by observation, as well as the circumstances in which epidemics arise, or by which they may be controlled.\"<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 95.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe showed that during the smallpox epidemic, a plot of the number of deaths per quarter followed a roughly bell-shaped or \"[[normal distribution|normal curve]]\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Farr |first1=William |title=Causes of death in England and Wales |journal=Second Annual Report of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England |date=1840 |volume=2 |pages=69-98 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064041955&view=1up&seq=71}} On p. 97, Farr stated that during a recent smallpox epidemic, the number of deaths versus time followed a roughly normal curve:  \"The rates vary with the density of the population, the numbers susceptible of attack, the mortality, and the accidental circumstances; so that to obtain the mean rates applicable to the whole population, or to any portion of the population, several epidemics should be investigated.  It appears probable, however, that the small-pox increases at an accelerated and then a retarded rate; that it declines first at a slightly accelerated, and at a rapidly accelerated, and lastly at a retarded rate, until the disease attains the minimum intensity, and remains stationary.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownlee |first1=John |title=Historical note on Farr's theory of the epidemic |journal=The British Medical Journal, Part 2 |date=1915 |pages=250-252 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858012721373&view=1up&seq=298&size=125}}  From p. 250:  \"He specially considered the decline of the [smallpox] epidemic, and fitted the figures to a curve calculated by a method described.  Though he gives no equation of the form of the curve, it is quite obviously the normal curve of error.\"</ref> and that recent epidemics of other diseases had followed a similar pattern.<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 98. \"Table (q) exhibits the progress of four more epidemic diseases in the metropolis, \u2014 measles, typhus, hooping-cough, and scarlatina, \u2014 which have not yet been effectively controlled by medical science.  They exhibit the same regularity, but the laws which govern their course will be more conveniently discussed when the abstract of the observations has been extended over another year.\"</ref>\n\n==Research on cholera==\nThere was a major outbreak of [[cholera]] in London in 1849 which killed around 15,000 people.  Early industrialisation had made London the most populous city in the world at the time, and the [[River Thames]] was heavily polluted with untreated sewage. Farr subscribed to the conventional theory that cholera was carried by polluted air rather than water \u2013 the [[miasma theory of disease|miasmic theory]]. In addition, through his analysis of several variables and their association with death from cholera, Farr held the belief that elevation was the major contributor to the occurrence of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Bingham\n| first = P.\n| last2 = Verlander\n| first2 = N.

In that letter, he applied mathematics to the records of deaths during a recent [[smallpox]] epidemic, proposing that:\n\n<blockquote>\"If the latent cause of epidemics cannot be discovered, the mode in which it operates may be investigated.  The laws of its action may be determined by observation, as well as the circumstances in which epidemics arise, or by which they may be controlled.\"<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 95.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe showed that during the smallpox epidemic, a plot of the number of deaths per quarter followed a roughly bell-shaped or \"[[normal distribution|normal curve]]\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Farr |first1=William |title=Causes of death in England and Wales |journal=Second Annual Report of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England |date=1840 |volume=2 |pages=69-98 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101064041955&view=1up&seq=71}} On p. 97, Farr stated that during a recent smallpox epidemic, the number of deaths versus time followed a roughly normal curve:  \"The rates vary with the density of the population, the numbers susceptible of attack, the mortality, and the accidental circumstances; so that to obtain the mean rates applicable to the whole population, or to any portion of the population, several epidemics should be investigated.  It appears probable, however, that the small-pox increases at an accelerated and then a retarded rate; that it declines first at a slightly accelerated, and at a rapidly accelerated, and lastly at a retarded rate, until the disease attains the minimum intensity, and remains stationary.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownlee |first1=John |title=Historical note on Farr's theory of the epidemic |journal=The British Medical Journal, Part 2 |date=1915 |pages=250-252 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858012721373&view=1up&seq=298&size=125}}  From p. 250:  \"He specially considered the decline of the [smallpox] epidemic, and fitted the figures to a curve calculated by a method described.  Though he gives no equation of the form of the curve, it is quite obviously the normal curve of error.\"</ref> and that recent epidemics of other diseases had followed a similar pattern.<ref>(Farr, 1840), p. 98. \"Table (q) exhibits the progress of four more epidemic diseases in the metropolis, \u2014 measles, typhus, hooping-cough, and scarlatina, \u2014 which have not yet been effectively controlled by medical science.  They exhibit the same regularity, but the laws which govern their course will be more conveniently discussed when the abstract of the observations has been extended over another year.\"</ref>\n\n==Research on cholera==\nThere was a major outbreak of [[cholera]] in London in 1849 which killed around 15,000 people.  Early industrialisation had made London the most populous city in the world at the time, and the [[River Thames]] was heavily polluted with untreated sewage. Farr subscribed to the conventional theory that cholera was carried by polluted air rather than water \u2013 the [[miasma theory of disease|miasmic theory]]. In addition, through his analysis of several variables and their association with death from cholera, Farr held the belief that elevation was the major contributor to the occurrence of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Bingham\n| first = P.\n| last2 = Verlander\n| first2 = N.
