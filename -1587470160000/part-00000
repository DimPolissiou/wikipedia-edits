She speculates that the ''pulao'' was an army dish in medieval India. The armies, unable to cook elaborate meals, would prepare a one-pot dish where they cooked rice with whichever meat was available.

Biryani, on the other hand, contains more gravy (due to the use of [[yahni|''yakhni'']] in it), and is often cooked for longer, leaving the meat or vegetables more tender. Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\"/> Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (or vegetables) in the middle; whereas, the pulao is not layered.<ref name=\"Vir_invention\" />\n\n[[Colleen Taylor Sen]] lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VN_vCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 |title=Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India |last=Taylor Sen |first=Colleen |publisher=Reaktion Books |year=2014 |isbn=9781780233918 |pages=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n* Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal.\n* In biryani, meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat and rice are simmered in a liquid until the liquid is absorbed. However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in [[Lucknow]]), R. K. Saxena and Sangeeta Bhatnagar have reported pulao recipes in which the rice and meat are cooked separately and then mixed before the [[dum pukht|dum cooking]].<ref name=\"KrishTulasi2012\" /><ref name=\"BhatnagarSaxena1997\">{{cite book |first1=Sangeeta |last1=Bhatnagar |first2=R.

It is also known as ''kacchi yeqni''. It is typically cooked with chicken or [[goat meat]] and occasionally with fish or [[prawn]]s. The dish is cooked layered with the meat and a dahi-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot. A layer of rice (usually [[basmati rice]] or chinigura rice) is placed over it. Potatoes are often added before adding the rice layer. The pot is usually sealed (typically with wheat dough) to allow it to cook in its own steam and it is not opened until it is ready to serve.\n\n'''Tehari'''\n:[[Tehri (dish)|Tehari]], tehri or tehari are various names for the vegetarian version of biryani. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim [[Nawab]]s. It is prepared by adding the potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of traditional biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In [[Kashmir]], tehari is sold as [[street food]].

Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travelers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as [[Jama Masjid]] (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as [[Chandni Chowk]]). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\" /> A non-''dum'' biryani, using a lot of green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani.

The ''dum'' method of preparation (sealing the lid with dough (maida) or cloth and placing red-hot charcoal above the lid) is applied here.\n\n'''Kolkata biryani'''\n[[File:Kolkata Biryani.jpg|thumb|right|Kolkata biryani]]\n:Calcutta or [[Kolkata]] biryani evolved from the [[Lucknow]] style, when Awadh's last [[Nawab]] [[Wajid Ali Shah]] was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of [[Metiabruz]].<ref name=\"rediff_Priya2004\"/> Shah brought his personal chef with him. The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. The Calcutta biryani primarily uses meat and potatoes. However, this theory is vehemently opposed by Janab Shahanshah Mirza, great great grandson of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. According to him, Awadh's last ruler used to get an annual pension of Rs.12 Lakh and he was the highest paid pensioner in India. He was an animal lover and had set up a zoo in Kolkata. He used to spend about 25% of his pension on the maintenance of zoo and upkeep of animals. A man who can spend a substantial part of his income on the welfare of animals can certainly afford meat in his biryani, argues Mirza. He points out that potatoes were first introduced in Surat in the 17th century. They slowly spread to different regions and were brought to Bengal by English traders. In those days, potato was an exotic vegetable and because of low yield it was extremely expensive. The chefs who had accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah tried various combinations and experiments to enhance the taste of biryani. On one such occasion potatoes were added while cooking the biryani. It appealed to the taste buds of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was so pleased that he ordered that henceforth whenever biryani was cooked it should be with this vegetable. \n:The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. The marinade uses primarily [[nutmeg]], cinnamon, [[mace (spice)|mace]] along with cloves and cardamom in the [[dahi (curd)|dahi]]-based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with [[Pandanus tectorius|ketaki]] water or [[rose]] water along with saffron to give it flavour and a light yellowish colour.\n\n'''Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani'''\n:Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a type of biryani cooked in the neighboring towns of [[Ambur]] and [[Vaniyambadi]] in the [[Vellore district]] of the northeastern part of [[Tamil Nadu]], which has a high Muslim population. It was introduced by the [[Nawab of Arcot|Nawabs of Arcot]] who once ruled the area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://viralvidos.com/easy-chicken-biriyani-recipe/ |title=Easy chicken Biriyani Recipe |date=3 February 2017 |website=Viralvidos.com |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n:The Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is accompanied with 'dhalcha,' a sour [[brinjal]] curry and pachadi' or raitha, which is sliced onions mixed with plain curd, tomato, chilies and salt. It has a distinctive aroma and is considered light on the stomach. The usage of spice is moderate and curd is used as a gravy base.

She speculates that the ''pulao'' was an army dish in medieval India. The armies, unable to cook elaborate meals, would prepare a one-pot dish where they cooked rice with whichever meat was available.

Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\"/> Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (or vegetables) in the middle; whereas, the pulao is not layered.<ref name=\"Vir_invention\" />\n\n[[Colleen Taylor Sen]] lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VN_vCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 |title=Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India |last=Taylor Sen |first=Colleen |publisher=Reaktion Books |year=2014 |isbn=9781780233918 |pages=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n* Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal.\n* In biryani, meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat and rice are simmered in a liquid until the liquid is absorbed. However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in [[Lucknow]]), R. K.

It is also known as ''kacchi yeqni''. It is typically cooked with chicken or [[goat meat]] and occasionally with fish or [[prawn]]s. The dish is cooked layered with the meat and a dahi-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot. A layer of rice (usually [[basmati rice]] or chinigura rice) is placed over it. Potatoes are often added before adding the rice layer. The pot is usually sealed (typically with wheat dough) to allow it to cook in its own steam and it is not opened until it is ready to serve.\n\n'''Tehari'''\n:[[Tehri (dish)|Tehari]], tehri or tehari are various names for the vegetarian version of biryani. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim [[Nawab]]s. It is prepared by adding the potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of traditional biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In [[Kashmir]], tehari is sold as [[street food]]. Tehari became more popular during [[World War II]], when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani.\n\n'''Beef biryani'''\n[[File:Food-Beef-Biryani-2.jpg|thumb|Beef biryani |right]]\n:Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat.

Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travelers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as [[Jama Masjid]] (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as [[Chandni Chowk]]). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\" /> A non-''dum'' biryani, using a lot of green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani.

The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. The Calcutta biryani primarily uses meat and potatoes. However, this theory is vehemently opposed by Janab Shahanshah Mirza, great great grandson of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. According to him, Awadh's last ruler used to get an annual pension of Rs.12 Lakh and he was the highest paid pensioner in India. He was an animal lover and had set up a zoo in Kolkata. He used to spend about 25% of his pension on the maintenance of zoo and upkeep of animals. A man who can spend a substantial part of his income on the welfare of animals can certainly afford meat in his biryani, argues Mirza. He points out that potatoes were first introduced in Surat in the 17th century. They slowly spread to different regions and were brought to Bengal by English traders. In those days, potato was an exotic vegetable and because of low yield it was extremely expensive. The chefs who had accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah tried various combinations and experiments to enhance the taste of biryani. On one such occasion potatoes were added while cooking the biryani. It appealed to the taste buds of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was so pleased that he ordered that henceforth whenever biryani was cooked it should be with this vegetable. \n:The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. The marinade uses primarily [[nutmeg]], cinnamon, [[mace (spice)|mace]] along with cloves and cardamom in the [[dahi (curd)|dahi]]-based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with [[Pandanus tectorius|ketaki]] water or [[rose]] water along with saffron to give it flavour and a light yellowish colour.\n\n'''Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani'''\n:Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a type of biryani cooked in the neighboring towns of [[Ambur]] and [[Vaniyambadi]] in the [[Vellore district]] of the northeastern part of [[Tamil Nadu]], which has a high Muslim population.

There are other varieties of kryptonite such as red and gold kryptonite which have different but still generally negative effects on Superman. Due to Superman's popularity, ''kryptonite'' has become a byword for an extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with \"[[Achilles' heel]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horton|first1=Andrew|last2=McDougal|first2=Stuart Y.|last3=Braudy|first3=Leo|title=Play it Again, Sam: Retakes on Remakes|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520205936|page=287}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Kryptonite poisoning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The character [[Superman]] suffering from kryptonite poisoning, courtesy of villains [[Metallo]] and [[Titano|Titano the Super-Ape]].<br/>''[[Action Comics]] Annual'' #10 (March 2007).

Kryptonians under kryptonite's effects experience severe muscular weakness, usually to the point of collapse, and excruciating pain, with both conditions progressively intensifying. They often develop a fever and eventually will lose consciousness before death. The mineral will also gradually turn Kryptonian skin and blood green.\nAlthough canonical depictions vary widely, the majority of accounts maintain that although kryptonite exposure victims experience severe weakness and pain, exposure in itself does not eradicate the victim's superpowers, except those related to physical strength. Therefore victims retain most of their visual and sensory powers, although kryptonite itself appears impervious to damage by heat vision. Kryptonite exposure does not compromise the subject's invulnerability to other forms of injury; therefore it is not a practical strategy for a villain to first expose the victim to kryptonite, then kill them with a gun or other conventional weapon. However, some enemies have occasionally used weapons with kryptonite projectile ammunition, which can not only seriously wound a Kryptonian, but surgical treatment can be difficult, with the resistance to injury in an yellow sun environment being a major complication. In one such incident, the surgeon was forced to give Superman a controlled exposure to the mineral to order to make the proper incisions to remove all the internal bullet fragments.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | story = Bloodsport! | Title = Superman | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = April, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22}}</ref> Some accounts maintain paralysis is an effect of kryptonite exposure, although most depictions show victims still capable of limited movement.\nKryptonian characters have been shown to become immune to the effects of green kryptonite due to either long-term absorption of sunlight<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Mark Waid|artist=Alex Ross|story=|title=[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]|volume=|issue=|date=1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York|page=129|panel=4|id={{ISBN|1563893304}}}}</ref>or extremely high short-term exposure to the Sun.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Grant Morrison|penciller=Frank Quietly|inker=|colorist=|letterer=|editor=|story=|title=All-Star Superman|volume=|issue=#1|date=January 2006|publisher=DC Comics|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}</ref>Post-''Crisis'' sources establish that green kryptonite is also harmful to humans; with sufficient long-term exposure, it can result in [[cancer]], as [[Lex Luthor]] discovered, much to his dismay, from a ring with a green kryptonite jewel he wore to ward off Superman's presence.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=John Byrne|penciller=Dick Giordano|inker=|colorist=|letterer=|editor=|story=Games People Play|title=Action Comics|volume=1|issue=#600|date=May 1988|publisher=DC Comics|location=|page=8|panel=|id=}}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Red kryptonite'''|| Debuted in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #255 (Sept. 1958).

It also occasionally bestows [[metahuman]] abilities on humans depending on the circumstances of their exposure to it, such as a girl treated for a rare bone disease acquiring shapeshifting powers. These people are commonly known by the inhabitants of Smallville as \"Meteor Freaks\". The green variety of the mineral appears in several episodes every season, although other varieties appear, including: red in \"Red\" (2002), \"Exodus\", \"Exile\", \"Phoenix\" (2003), \"Unsafe\" (2005), \"Crimson\" (2007) and \"Upgrade\" (2010); black, formed when superheating green kryptonite in \"Crusade\" (2004) and \"Doomsday\" (2009); silver in \"Splinter\" (2005); blue in \"Blue\" (2007), \"Persona\" (2008), \"Kandor\" (2009), \"Salvation\" (2010) and  \"Harvest\" (2011); as a gem in \"Persuasion\" (2010) and gold in \"Prophecy\" and \"[[Finale (Smallville)|Finale]]\" (2011).

Silver kryptonite is featured in the episode \"[[Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)|Nevertheless, She Persisted]]\". In season 3, the black kryptonite is pivotal to its arc, first appearing in the episode \"The Fanatical\", in which it is being referred to as Harun-El by Kryptonians. The Worldkiller Coven from Krypton, headed by dark priestess Selena, schemes to use the Harun-El to terraform Earth into a Krypton-like planet for Kryptonians to inhabit. The protagonists uses the Harun-El to split the Worldkiller Coven's servant, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Reign|Reign]], from her human alter-ego Samantha Arias. By the end of the season finale, it is revealed that Supergirl's being is also divided after her exposure to it during her final battle with Reign.

Now Batman must work with [[Krypto the Superdog]] to hold off Superman until the effects of the red kryptonite wear off.\n\n===Films===\n* In ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) Lex Luthor ([[Gene Hackman]]) deduces that a meteorite found in [[Addis Ababa]] is actually a radioactive piece of the exploded planet Krypton. Luthor uses the mineral to weaken Superman ([[Christopher Reeve]]), who is saved by Luthor's lover Eve Teschmacher ([[Valerie Perrine]]).\n* In ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983) billionaire Ross Webster ([[Robert Vaughn]]) orders the creation of synthetic kryptonite. Computer programmer Gus Gorman ([[Richard Pryor]]) uses tar to compensate for an unknown component of kryptonite, causing the newly created mineral to eventually turn Superman evil and split the hero into two beings. Gorman's \"supercomputer\" later fights Superman and uses a kryptonite ray.\n* In ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006) Lex Luthor ([[Kevin Spacey]]) steals the Addis Ababa L9 Pallasite Meteorite and uses kryptonite to create a new Kryptonian landmass and a shard for use against Superman. The film describes kryptonite's formula as \"sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine\". A year after the film was released, a substance with a similar formula was discovered, [[jadarite]], a coincidence which led to [[Mass-media|media]] attention.<ref name=\"bbc\"/><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3070418 ABC]</ref><ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/23/britain.kryptonite.reut/index.html CNN]</ref><ref>[http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042401973.html ''Washington Post'']</ref>The new mineral, unlike the fictional material in the movie, does not contain [[fluorine]] and does not glow green.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{citation| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6584229.stm| title = 'Kryptonite' discovered in mine|date = 24 Apr 2007| work = BBC News}}</ref>\n* In ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' (2008), Batman mentions he keeps some kryptonite in case he needs to fight Superman.\n* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' (2010) an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Lex Luthor uses blue kryptonite against the villain [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]].\n* In ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'' (2012), the villain [[Metallo]] wounds Superman with a kryptonite bullet, but he is saved by the [[Justice League|JLA]].\n* In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) , Green kryptonite is discovered by men working for Lex Luthor ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) at the bottom of the [[Indian Ocean]] (after Superman's battle with the World Engine in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'') and experimented with by Luthor, who learns of its harmful effect on Kryptonians when the corpse of General Zod is exposed to it. The kryptonite is then stolen from Luthor by Batman ([[Ben Affleck]]), who uses it to create kryptonite gas pellets and a kryptonite-tipped spear, both of which he later uses in battle with Superman ([[Henry Cavill]]). [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] is also shown to be weakened by kryptonite, allowing Superman to use the spear to kill him in the film's climax.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title='Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice': 6 EW exclusive photos|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/batman-v-superman-dawn-justice-first-look-photos/2232978_batman-and-superman-square-first-time|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=2 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* In ''Superman: Atari 2600'' (1978) Luthor has created kryptonite satellites and scattered them around Metropolis that take away Superman's ability to fly when touched.

In its most well-known form, it is a green, crystalline material originating from Superman's home world of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], that emits a peculiar radiation that weakens Superman, but is generally harmless to humans when exposed to it in short term. There are other varieties of kryptonite such as red and gold kryptonite which have different but still generally negative effects on Superman. Due to Superman's popularity, ''kryptonite'' has become a byword for an extraordinary exploitable weakness, synonymous with \"[[Achilles' heel]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horton|first1=Andrew|last2=McDougal|first2=Stuart Y.|last3=Braudy|first3=Leo|title=Play it Again, Sam: Retakes on Remakes|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0520205936|page=287}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Kryptonite poisoning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The character [[Superman]] suffering from kryptonite poisoning, courtesy of villains [[Metallo]] and [[Titano|Titano the Super-Ape]].<br/>''[[Action Comics]] Annual'' #10 (March 2007).

Kryptonians under kryptonite exposure experience severe muscular weakness, usually to the point of collapse, and excruciating pain, with both conditions progressively intensifying. Kryptonians under kryptonite exposure usually develop a fever and eventually will lose consciousness before death. Under kryptonite exposure, the blood of Kryptonians begins turning green, and their skin gradually assumes a green color.\nAlthough canonical depictions vary widely, the majority of accounts maintain that although kryptonite exposure victims experience severe weakness and pain, exposure in itself does not eradicate the victim's superpowers, except those related to physical strength. Therefore victims retain most of their visual and sensory powers, although kryptonite itself appears impervious to damage by heat vision. Kryptonite exposure does not compromise the subject's invulnerability to other forms of injury; therefore it is not a practical strategy for a villain to first expose the victim to kryptonite, then kill them with a gun or other conventional weapon. However, some enemies have occasionally used weapons with kryptonite projectile ammunition, which can not only seriously wound a Kryptonian, but surgical treatment can be difficult, with the resistance to injury in an yellow sun environment being a major complication. In one such incident, the surgeon was forced to give Superman a controlled exposure to the mineral to order to make the proper incisions to remove all the internal bullet fragments.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Inker = [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]] | story = Bloodsport! | Title = Superman | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = April, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22}}</ref> Some accounts maintain paralysis is an effect of kryptonite exposure, although most depictions show victims still capable of limited movement.\nKryptonian characters have been shown to become immune to the effects of green kryptonite due to either long-term absorption of sunlight<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Mark Waid|artist=Alex Ross|story=|title=[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]|volume=|issue=|date=1997|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=New York|page=129|panel=4|id={{ISBN|1563893304}}}}</ref>or extremely high short-term exposure to the Sun.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Grant Morrison|penciller=Frank Quietly|inker=|colorist=|letterer=|editor=|story=|title=All-Star Superman|volume=|issue=#1|date=January 2006|publisher=DC Comics|location=|page=|panel=|id=}}</ref>Post-''Crisis'' sources establish that green kryptonite is also harmful to humans; with sufficient long-term exposure, it can result in [[cancer]], as [[Lex Luthor]] discovered, much to his dismay, from a ring with a green kryptonite jewel he wore to ward off Superman's presence.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=John Byrne|penciller=Dick Giordano|inker=|colorist=|letterer=|editor=|story=Games People Play|title=Action Comics|volume=1|issue=#600|date=May 1988|publisher=DC Comics|location=|page=8|panel=|id=}}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Red kryptonite'''|| Debuted in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #255 (Sept. 1958).

The red variety was featured in the episode \"Super Menace\". A Bizarro White variant was featured in the episode \"The Battle With Bizarro\", which heals the title character.\n*''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (1993\u20131997) featured green kryptonite in the episodes \"The Green, Green Glow of Home\", \"Barbarians at the Planet\", \"The House of Luthor\", \"Metallo\", \"Top Copy\" and \"Battleground Earth\". The red variety was featured in the episodes \"Individual Responsibility\", \"Ultrawoman\" and \"Lethal Weapon\".\n* ''[[Smallville]]'' (2001\u20132011) featured kryptonite on a regular basis. A large quantity of the green variety descends to Earth in a meteor shower, arriving in the town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville, Kansas]] with the spaceship containing the infant Kal-El. The material is colloquially referred to by Smallville residents as \"meteor rock\", but is eventually called \"kryptonite\" by [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] once he discovers his origins in season two episode \"Visitor\" (in real life, the area near [[Brenham, Kansas]] is known as the site of a major meteorite strike between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago).<ref>Scharping, Nathaniel (April 4, 2018). [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/04/04/meteorites-ancient-cultures \"Space Metal Has Captivated Humanity for Ages\"]. ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''.</ref> Aside from being harmful to Clark Kent, the mineral produces bizarre changes in flora and fauna. It also occasionally bestows [[metahuman]] abilities on humans depending on the circumstances of their exposure to it, such as a girl treated for a rare bone disease acquiring shapeshifting powers. These people are commonly known by the inhabitants of Smallville as \"Meteor Freaks\". The green variety of the mineral appears in several episodes every season, although other varieties appear, including: red in \"Red\" (2002), \"Exodus\", \"Exile\", \"Phoenix\" (2003), \"Unsafe\" (2005), \"Crimson\" (2007) and \"Upgrade\" (2010); black, formed when superheating green kryptonite in \"Crusade\" (2004) and \"Doomsday\" (2009); silver in \"Splinter\" (2005); blue in \"Blue\" (2007), \"Persona\" (2008), \"Kandor\" (2009), \"Salvation\" (2010) and  \"Harvest\" (2011); as a gem in \"Persuasion\" (2010) and gold in \"Prophecy\" and \"[[Finale (Smallville)|Finale]]\" (2011). ''Smallville'' was the first appearance of a black kryptonite that would split a person into their good and evil sides, before later being brought into the comic canon in ''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #2 (Oct. 2005).\n*''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' (2015\u2013present) featured green kryptonite in the episodes: \"[[Pilot (Supergirl)|Pilot]]\", \"[[Stronger Together (Supergirl)|Stronger Together]]\", \"[[Hostile Takeover (Supergirl)|Hostile Takeover]]\", \"[[For the Girl Who Has Everything (Supergirl)|For the Girl Who Has Everything]]\", and \"[[Distant Sun (Supergirl)|Distant Sun]]\". In the second part of [[Arrowverse]]'s 2017 crossover \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]],\" reveals that [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]] of Earth-1 somehow obtains samples of green kryptonite, and uses them to construct kryptonite arrows as deterrents against rogue Kryptonians such as Overgirl (Supergirl's parallel universe counterpart from Krypton-X) and Superman impostor [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] (on 2018 crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\"). DEO manages to synthesize and create blue kryptonite which is featured in the episode \"[[Bizarro (Supergirl)|Bizarro]]\". The red kryptonite is featured in the episode \"[[Falling (Supergirl)|Falling]]\" as a failed attempt to recreate green kryptonite by [[Maxwell Lord]]. Silver kryptonite is featured in the episode \"[[Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)|Nevertheless, She Persisted]]\". In season 3, the black kryptonite is pivotal to its arc, first appearing in the episode \"The Fanatical\", in which it is being referred to as Harun-El by Kryptonians. The Worldkiller Coven from Krypton, headed by dark priestess Selena, schemes to use the Harun-El to terraform Earth into a Krypton-like planet for Kryptonians to inhabit. The protagonists uses the Harun-El to split the Worldkiller Coven's servant, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Reign|Reign]], from her human alter-ego Samantha Arias. By the end of the season finale, it is revealed that Supergirl's being is also divided after her exposure to it during her final battle with Reign. In season 4, Lena Luthor develops a serum derived from Harun-El, and Lex Luthor, [[Agent Liberty]] and James Olsen develop metahuman abilities after being injected with it such as enhanced speed, durability, strength, and a healing factor.\n\n====Animation====\n* ''[[The Brady Kids]]'' (1972\u20131973) featured green kryptonite in the episode \"Cindy's Super Friend\" which shows [[Clark Kent]] attempting to become Superman in the Kids' clubhouse, only to be incapacitated by a piece of green kryptonite as part of a rock collection. \n* ''[[Super Friends]]'' (1973\u20131986) features kryptonite in the episodes \"Super Friends: Rest in Peace\" (\"Krypton steel\"); \"Darkseid's Golden Trap\" (gold); \"Terror From the Phantom Zone\" (blue, green, and red); \"Return of the Phantoms\" (green); \"Rokan: Enemy from Space\" (green); \"Bazarowurld\" (red and blue); \"Revenge of Bizarro\" (red and blue); Will the World Collide?\" (green); \"Uncle Mxyzptlk\" (red); \"The Death of Superman\" (green); \"Batman: Dead or Alive\" (green).\n* ''[[Superman (TV series)|Superman]]'' (1988) features a kryptonite ring worn by Lex Luthor.\n* ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (1996\u20132000) offers an explanation of the effect of the material on Superman. This series and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' (1997\u20131999) showcase a three-part [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] story arc called ''World's Finest'' that demonstrates the effect of kryptonite poisoning on humans. \n** ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' (2001\u20132004) explores the same theme<!-- What theme? -->.\n* In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (1999\u20132001) the two-part episode \"The Call\" reveals that kryptonite has been kept safe in the distant future as a deterrent against Superman due to the hero's past as a rogue agent under [[Darkseid]]'s mind manipulation.\n* ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'' (2005\u20132006) features green, red and a purple-spotted variation.\n* ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' (2006\u20132008) features green kryptonite.\n* ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (2010\u20132013, 2018) features green kryptonite in the episode \"Auld Acquaintance\".\n* In ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Battle of the Superheroes!\", Superman is infected with a red kryptonite necklace secretly given to [[Lois Lane]] by Lex Luthor, which causes Superman to become evil. Now Batman must work with [[Krypto the Superdog]] to hold off Superman until the effects of the red kryptonite wear off.\n\n===Films===\n* In ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) Lex Luthor ([[Gene Hackman]]) deduces that a meteorite found in [[Addis Ababa]] is actually a radioactive piece of the exploded planet Krypton. Luthor uses the mineral to weaken Superman ([[Christopher Reeve]]), who is saved by Luthor's lover Eve Teschmacher ([[Valerie Perrine]]).\n* In ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983) billionaire Ross Webster ([[Robert Vaughn]]) orders the creation of synthetic kryptonite. Computer programmer Gus Gorman ([[Richard Pryor]]) uses tar to compensate for an unknown component of kryptonite, causing the newly created mineral to eventually turn Superman evil and split the hero into two beings. Gorman's \"supercomputer\" later fights Superman and uses a kryptonite ray.\n* In ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006) Lex Luthor ([[Kevin Spacey]]) steals the Addis Ababa L9 Pallasite Meteorite and uses kryptonite to create a new Kryptonian landmass and a shard for use against Superman. The film describes kryptonite's formula as \"sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine\". A year after the film was released, a substance with a similar formula was discovered, [[jadarite]], a coincidence which led to [[Mass-media|media]] attention.<ref name=\"bbc\"/><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3070418 ABC]</ref><ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/23/britain.kryptonite.reut/index.html CNN]</ref><ref>[http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042401973.html ''Washington Post'']</ref>The new mineral, unlike the fictional material in the movie, does not contain [[fluorine]] and does not glow green.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{citation| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6584229.stm| title = 'Kryptonite' discovered in mine|date = 24 Apr 2007| work = BBC News}}</ref>\n* In ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' (2008), Batman mentions he keeps some kryptonite in case he needs to fight Superman.\n* In ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' (2010) an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Lex Luthor uses blue kryptonite against the villain [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]].\n* In ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'' (2012), the villain [[Metallo]] wounds Superman with a kryptonite bullet, but he is saved by the [[Justice League|JLA]].\n* In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) , Green kryptonite is discovered by men working for Lex Luthor ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) at the bottom of the [[Indian Ocean]] (after Superman's battle with the World Engine in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'') and experimented with by Luthor, who learns of its harmful effect on Kryptonians when the corpse of General Zod is exposed to it. The kryptonite is then stolen from Luthor by Batman ([[Ben Affleck]]), who uses it to create kryptonite gas pellets and a kryptonite-tipped spear, both of which he later uses in battle with Superman ([[Henry Cavill]]).

By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be incurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.<ref name=\"Lewes\">{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Sigmund Freud====\n{{Main|Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality}}\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Freud (1856\u20131939) was skeptical of the possibility of therapeutic conversion.]]\n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] was a physician and the founder of psychoanalysis. Freud stated that homosexuality could sometimes be removed through hypnotic suggestion,<ref name=\"SigmundFreudOnSexuality\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=51}}</ref> and was influenced by [[Eugen Steinach]], a [[Vienna|Viennese]] endocrinologist who transplanted [[testicle]]s from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation,<ref>{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|p=74,109}}</ref> stating that his research had \"thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of homo-eroticism\".<ref name=\"SigmundFreudOnSexualityP58\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=58}}</ref> Freud cautioned that Steinach's operations would not necessarily make possible a therapy that could be generally applied, arguing that such transplant procedures would be effective in changing homosexuality in men only in cases in which it was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of women, and that probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=58\u201359}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=400}}</ref> Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the [[immune system]] rejects transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.<ref>{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|pp=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nFreud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper \"The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman\", which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a [[lesbian]]. Her father wanted this condition changed. In Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which she entered therapy, and because homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that \"in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse\".<ref name=\"SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesIIP376\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=376}}</ref> Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible, not eliminating homosexual feelings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=375}}</ref>\n\nGay people could seldom be convinced that heterosexual sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.<ref name=\"OconnorandRyan\">{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Ryan|1993|pp=30\u201347}}</ref><ref name=\"SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=371\u2013400}}</ref><ref name=\"LewesP34\">{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=34}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, a mother asked Freud to treat her son. Freud replied in a letter that later became famous:<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=32}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. ... it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. ... By asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.<ref name=\"ErnstLFreud\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423\u2013424}}</ref>}}\n\n====S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi====\n[[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] was an influential psychoanalyst. Ferenczi hoped to cure some kinds of homosexuality completely, but was content in practice with reducing what he considered gay men's hostility to women, along with the urgency of their homosexual desires, and with helping them to become attracted to and potent with women. In his view, a gay man who was confused about his sexual identity and felt himself to be \"a woman with the wish to be loved by a man\" was not a promising candidate for cure. Ferenczi believed that complete cures of homosexuality might become possible in the future when psychoanalytic technique had been improved.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /><ref name=\"ErnestJonesVol2\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1955|p=}}</ref><ref name=\"MartinStanton\">{{Harvnb|Stanton|1991|p=}}</ref>\n\n====Anna Freud====\nDaughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud became an influential psychoanalytic theorist in the UK.<ref name=\"Young-Bruehl\" />\n\n[[Anna Freud]] reported the successful treatment of homosexuals as neurotics in a series of unpublished lectures. In 1949 she published \"Some Clinical Remarks Concerning the Treatment of Cases of Male Homosexuality\" in the ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]''. In her view, it was important to pay attention to the interaction of passive and active homosexual fantasies and strivings, the original interplay of which prevented adequate identification with the father. The patient should be told that his choice of a passive partner allows him to enjoy a passive or receptive mode, while his choice of an active partner allows him to recapture his lost masculinity. She claimed that these interpretations would reactivate repressed [[castration complex|castration anxieties]], and childhood narcissistic grandiosity and its complementary fear of dissolving into nothing during heterosexual intercourse would come with the renewal of heterosexual potency.<ref name=\"Lewes\" />\n\nAnna Freud in 1951 published \"Clinical Observations on the Treatment of Male Homosexuality\" in ''[[The Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'' and \"Homosexuality\" in the ''[[American Psychoanalytic Association]] (APsaA) Bulletin''. In these articles, she insisted on the attainment of full object-love of the opposite sex as a requirement for cure of homosexuality. In 1951 she gave a lecture about treatment of homosexuality which was criticised by [[Edmund Bergler]], who emphasised the oral fears of patients and minimized the importance of the phallic castration fears she had discussed.<ref name=\"Lewes\" />\n\nAnna Freud recommended in 1956 to a journalist who was preparing an article about psychoanalysis for ''[[The Observer]]'' of London that she not quote Freud's letter to the American mother, on the grounds that \"nowadays we can cure many more homosexuals than was thought possible in the beginning. The other reason is that readers may take this as a confirmation that all analysis can do is to convince patients that their defects or 'immoralities' do not matter and that they should be happy with them. That would be unfortunate.\"<ref name=\"Young-Bruehl\">{{Harvnb|Young-Bruehl|1988|p=327}}</ref>\n\n====Melanie Klein====\n[[Melanie Klein]] was a pupil of Ferenczi. Her seminal book ''The Psycho-Analysis of Children'', based on lectures given to the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] in the 1920s, was published in 1932. Klein claimed that entry into the [[Oedipus Complex]] is based on mastery of primitive anxiety from the oral and anal stages. If these tasks are not performed properly, developments in the Oedipal stage will be unstable. Complete analysis of patients with such unstable developments would require uncovering these early concerns. The analysis of homosexuality required dealing with paranoid trends based on the oral stage. ''The Psycho-Analysis of Children'' ends with the analysis of Mr. B., a gay man. Klein claimed that he illustrated pathologies that enter into all forms of homosexuality: a gay man idealizes \"the good penis\" of his partner to allay the fear of attack he feels due to having projected his paranoid hatred onto the imagined \"bad penis\" of his mother as an infant. She stated that Mr. B.'s homosexual behaviour diminished after he overcame his need to adore the \"good penis\" of an idealized man. This was made possible by his recovering his belief in the good mother and his ability to sexually gratify her with his good penis and plentiful [[semen]].<ref name=\"Lewes\" />\n\n==== Vote by European parliament in March 2018 ====\nIn March 2018, a majority of 435 against 109 representatives in the [[European Parliament|European parliament]] passed a resolution condemning conversion therapy and urging [[European Union]] member states to ban the practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=30751|title=EU-Parlament st\u00e4rkt LGBTI-Grundrechte|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://schwulissimo.de/politik/245183/EuropaeischesParlamentverurteiltdieHeilungvonHomosexuellen.htm|title=Schwulissimo - Europ\u00e4isches Parlament verurteilt die \"Heilung\" von Homosexuellen|website=schwulissimo.de|access-date=2018-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303050904/http://schwulissimo.de/politik/245183/EuropaeischesParlamentverurteiltdieHeilungvonHomosexuellen.htm|archive-date=2018-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/03/01/european-parliament-condemns-gay-cure-therapy-and-tells-eu-member-states-to-ban-it/|title=European Parliament condemns gay 'cure' therapy and tells EU member states to ban it|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n\n====20th century====\nPsychoanalysis started to receive recognition in the United States in 1909, when Sigmund Freud delivered a series of lectures at [[Clark University]] in [[Massachusetts]] at the invitation of [[G.

Brill criticised physical treatments for homosexuality such as bladder washing, [[rectum|rectal]] massage, and castration, along with [[hypnosis]], but referred approvingly to Freud and Sadger's use of psychoanalysis, calling its results \"very gratifying\".<ref name=KatzP149>{{Harvnb|Katz|1976|p=149}}</ref> Since Brill understood curing homosexuality as restoring heterosexual potency, he claimed that he had cured his patients in several cases, even though many remained homosexual.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /><ref name=\"Katz\">{{Harvnb|Katz|1976}}</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Stekel]], an Austrian, published his views on treatment of homosexuality, which he considered a disease, in the American ''[[National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis#Current ideology|Psychoanalytic Review]]'' in 1930. Stekel believed that \"success was fairly certain\" in changing homosexuality through psychoanalysis provided that it was performed correctly and the patient wanted to be treated. In 1932, ''The Psychoanalytic Quarterly'' published a translation of [[Helene Deutsch]]'s paper \"On Female Homosexuality\". Deutsch reported her analysis of a lesbian, who did not become heterosexual as a result of treatment, but who managed to achieve a \"positive libidinal relationship\" with another woman. Deutsch indicated that she would have considered heterosexuality a better outcome.<ref name=\"Katz\" />\n\n[[Edmund Bergler]] was the most important psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /> He was vociferous in his opposition to [[Alfred Kinsey]]. Kinsey's work, and its reception, led Bergler to develop his own theories for treatment, which were essentially to \"[[blame the victim]]\", in the evaluation of Jennifer Terry, associate professor of Woman's Studies.<ref name=\"Terry\"/> Bergler claimed that if gay people wanted to change, and the right therapeutic approach was taken, then they could be cured in 90% of cases.<ref name=\"BerglerTime\">{{Harvnb|Bergler|1956}}</ref> Bergler used confrontational therapy in which gay people were punished in order to make them aware of their masochism. Bergler openly violated professional ethics to achieve this, breaking patient confidentiality in discussing the cases of patients with other patients, bullying them, calling them liars and telling them they were worthless.<ref name=\"Terry\">{{Harvnb|Terry|1999|pp=308\u2013314}}</ref> He insisted that gay people could be cured. Bergler confronted Kinsey because Kinsey thwarted the possibility of cure by presenting homosexuality as an acceptable way of life, which was the basis of the gay rights activism of the time.<ref name=\"Terry\"/> Bergler popularised his views in the United States in the 1950s using magazine articles and books aimed at non-specialists.<ref name=\"Terry\" /><ref name=\"Bergler\">{{Harvnb|Bergler|1962}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the mother who wrote to Freud asking him to treat her son sent Freud's response to the ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', in which it was published.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /> The 1952 first edition of the American Psychiatric Association's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-I) classified homosexuality as a mental disorder.<ref name=\"RonaldBayer\" />\n\nDuring the three decades between Freud's death in 1939 and the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, conversion therapy received approval from most of the psychiatric establishment in the United States.<ref name=\"Drescher\">{{Harvnb|Drescher|1998a|pp=19\u201342}}</ref> In 1962, [[Irving Bieber]] ''et al.'' published ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'', in which they concluded that \"although this change may be more easily accomplished by some than by others, in our judgment a heterosexual shift is a possibility for all homosexuals who are strongly motivated to change\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bieber|1962|p=319}}</ref>\n\nThere was a riot in 1969 at the Stonewall Bar in New York after a police raid. The Stonewall riot acquired symbolic significance for the gay rights movement and came to be seen as the opening of a new phase in the struggle for gay liberation. Following these events, conversion therapy came under increasing attack. Activism against conversion therapy increasingly focused on the DSM's designation of homosexuality as a psychopathology.<ref name=\"RonaldBayer\" /> In 1973, after years of criticism from gay activists and bitter dispute among psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''. Supporters of the change used evidence from researchers such as Kinsey and [[Evelyn Hooker]]. Psychiatrist Robert Spitzer, a member of the APA's Committee on Nomenclature, played an important role in the events that led to this decision.

Cessation of the aversive stimuli was typically accompanied by the presentation of opposite-sex erotic images, with the objective of strengthening heterosexual feelings. In \"Aversion therapy for sexual deviation: a critical review\", published in 1966, M. P. Feldman claimed a 58% cure rate, but Douglas Haldeman is skeptical that such stressful methods permit feelings of sexual responsiveness, and notes that Feldman defined success as suppression of homosexuality and increased capacity for heterosexual behavior.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=152}}</ref>\n\nAnother method used was the covert sensitization method, which involves instructing patients to imagine vomiting or receiving electric shocks, writing that only single case studies have been conducted, and that their results cannot be generalized. Haldeman writes that behavioral conditioning studies tend to decrease homosexual feelings, but do not increase heterosexual feelings, citing Rangaswami's \"Difficulties in arousing and increasing heterosexual responsiveness in a homosexual: A case report\", published in 1982, as typical in this respect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref>\n\nHaldeman concludes that such methods can be called [[torture]], besides being ineffective.

They advocated long-term therapy aimed at resolving the unconscious childhood conflicts that they considered responsible for homosexuality. Haldeman notes that Bieber's methodology has been criticized because it relied upon a clinical sample, the description of the outcomes was based upon subjective therapist impression, and follow-up data were poorly presented. Bieber reported a 27% success rate from long-term therapy, but only 18% of the patients in whom Bieber considered the treatment successful had been exclusively homosexual to begin with, while 50% had been bisexual. In Haldeman's view, this makes even Bieber's unimpressive claims of success misleading.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=150\u2013151}}</ref>\n\nHaldeman discusses other psychoanalytic studies of attempts to change homosexuality. Curran and Parr's \"Homosexuality: An analysis of 100 male cases\", published in 1957, reported no significant increase in heterosexual behavior. Mayerson and Lief's \"Psychotherapy of homosexuals: A follow-up study of nineteen cases\", published in 1965, reported that half of its 19 subjects were exclusively heterosexual in behavior four and a half years after treatment, but its outcomes were based on patient self-report and had no external validation. In Haldeman's view, those participants in the study who reported change were bisexual at the outset, and its authors wrongly interpreted capacity for heterosexual sex as change of sexual orientation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=151, 256}}</ref>\n\n===Reparative therapy===\n\nThe term \"reparative therapy\" has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy generally, but according to Jack Drescher it properly refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists [[Elizabeth Moberly]] and [[Joseph Nicolosi]].<ref name=\"Drescher1998\" /> The term ''reparative'' refers to Nicolosi's postulate that same-sex attraction is a person's unconscious attempt to \"self-repair\" feelings of inferiority.<ref name=Hicks_1999>{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Karolyn Ann|title=\"Reparative Therapy\": Whether Parental Attempts to Change a Child's Sexual Orientation Can Legally Constitute Child Abuse|journal=American University Law Review|date=1999|volume=49|issue=2|pages=505\u2013547|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1288&context=aulr|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Nicolosi|first1=Joseph|title=What Is Reparative Therapy?

The original study did not describe the treatment methodology used, but this was published five years later. John C. Gonsiorek criticized their study on several grounds in 1981, pointing out that while Masters and Johnson stated that their patients were screened for major psychopathology or severe neurosis, they did not explain how this screening was performed, or how the motivation of the patients to change was assessed. Nineteen of their subjects were described as uncooperative during therapy and refused to participate in a follow-up assessment, but all of them were assumed without justification to have successfully changed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=154}}</ref>\n\nHaldeman writes that Masters and Johnson's study was founded on heterosexist bias, and that it would be tremendously difficult to replicate. In his view, the distinction Masters and Johnson made between \"conversion\" (helping gay men with no previous heterosexual experience to learn heterosexual sex) and \"reversion\" (directing men with some previous heterosexual experience back to heterosexuality) was not well founded. Many of the subjects Masters and Johnson labelled homosexual may not have been homosexual, since, of their participants, only 17% identified themselves as exclusively homosexual, while 83% were in the predominantly heterosexual to bisexual range. Haldeman observed that since 30% of the sample was lost to the follow-up, it is possible that the outcome sample did not include any people attracted mainly or exclusively to the same sex. Haldeman concludes that it is likely that, rather than converting or reverting gay people to heterosexuality, Masters and Johnson only strengthened heterosexual responsiveness in people who were already bisexual.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=155}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n{{main|Lobotomy}}\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, U.S. neurologist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] popularized the [[Lobotomy#Transorbital lobotomy|ice-pick lobotomy]] as a treatment for homosexuality.

By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be incurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.<ref name=\"Lewes\">{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Sigmund Freud====\n{{Main|Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality}}\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Freud (1856\u20131939) was skeptical of the possibility of therapeutic conversion.]]\n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] was a physician and the founder of psychoanalysis. Freud stated that homosexuality could sometimes be removed through hypnotic suggestion,<ref name=\"SigmundFreudOnSexuality\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=51}}</ref> and was influenced by [[Eugen Steinach]], a [[Vienna|Viennese]] endocrinologist who transplanted [[testicle]]s from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation,<ref>{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|p=74,109}}</ref> stating that his research had \"thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of homo-eroticism\".<ref name=\"SigmundFreudOnSexualityP58\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=58}}</ref> Freud cautioned that Steinach's operations would not necessarily make possible a therapy that could be generally applied, arguing that such transplant procedures would be effective in changing homosexuality in men only in cases in which it was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of women, and that probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=58\u201359}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=400}}</ref> Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the [[immune system]] rejects transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.<ref>{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|pp=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nFreud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper \"The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman\", which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a [[lesbian]]. Her father wanted this condition changed. In Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which she entered therapy, and because homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that \"in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse\".<ref name=\"SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesIIP376\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=376}}</ref> Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible, not eliminating homosexual feelings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=375}}</ref>\n\nGay people could seldom be convinced that heterosexual sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.<ref name=\"OconnorandRyan\">{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Ryan|1993|pp=30\u201347}}</ref><ref name=\"SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=371\u2013400}}</ref><ref name=\"LewesP34\">{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=34}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, a mother asked Freud to treat her son. Freud replied in a letter that later became famous:<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=32}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. ... it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. ... By asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.<ref name=\"ErnstLFreud\">{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423\u2013424}}</ref>}}\n\n====S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi====\n[[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] was an influential psychoanalyst. Ferenczi hoped to cure some kinds of homosexuality completely, but was content in practice with reducing what he considered gay men's hostility to women, along with the urgency of their homosexual desires, and with helping them to become attracted to and potent with women. In his view, a gay man who was confused about his sexual identity and felt himself to be \"a woman with the wish to be loved by a man\" was not a promising candidate for cure. Ferenczi believed that complete cures of homosexuality might become possible in the future when psychoanalytic technique had been improved.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /><ref name=\"ErnestJonesVol2\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1955|p=}}</ref><ref name=\"MartinStanton\">{{Harvnb|Stanton|1991|p=}}</ref>\n\n====Anna Freud====\nDaughter of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud became an influential psychoanalytic theorist in the UK.<ref name=\"Young-Bruehl\" />\n\n[[Anna Freud]] reported the successful treatment of homosexuals as neurotics in a series of unpublished lectures. In 1949 she published \"Some Clinical Remarks Concerning the Treatment of Cases of Male Homosexuality\" in the ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]''. In her view, it was important to pay attention to the interaction of passive and active homosexual fantasies and strivings, the original interplay of which prevented adequate identification with the father. The patient should be told that his choice of a passive partner allows him to enjoy a passive or receptive mode, while his choice of an active partner allows him to recapture his lost masculinity. She claimed that these interpretations would reactivate repressed [[castration complex|castration anxieties]], and childhood narcissistic grandiosity and its complementary fear of dissolving into nothing during heterosexual intercourse would come with the renewal of heterosexual potency.<ref name=\"Lewes\" />\n\nAnna Freud in 1951 published \"Clinical Observations on the Treatment of Male Homosexuality\" in ''[[The Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'' and \"Homosexuality\" in the ''[[American Psychoanalytic Association]] (APsaA) Bulletin''. In these articles, she insisted on the attainment of full object-love of the opposite sex as a requirement for cure of homosexuality. In 1951 she gave a lecture about treatment of homosexuality which was criticised by [[Edmund Bergler]], who emphasised the oral fears of patients and minimized the importance of the phallic castration fears she had discussed.<ref name=\"Lewes\" />\n\nAnna Freud recommended in 1956 to a journalist who was preparing an article about psychoanalysis for ''[[The Observer]]'' of London that she not quote Freud's letter to the American mother, on the grounds that \"nowadays we can cure many more homosexuals than was thought possible in the beginning. The other reason is that readers may take this as a confirmation that all analysis can do is to convince patients that their defects or 'immoralities' do not matter and that they should be happy with them. That would be unfortunate.\"<ref name=\"Young-Bruehl\">{{Harvnb|Young-Bruehl|1988|p=327}}</ref>\n\n====Melanie Klein====\n[[Melanie Klein]] was a pupil of Ferenczi. Her seminal book ''The Psycho-Analysis of Children'', based on lectures given to the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] in the 1920s, was published in 1932. Klein claimed that entry into the [[Oedipus Complex]] is based on mastery of primitive anxiety from the oral and anal stages. If these tasks are not performed properly, developments in the Oedipal stage will be unstable. Complete analysis of patients with such unstable developments would require uncovering these early concerns. The analysis of homosexuality required dealing with paranoid trends based on the oral stage. ''The Psycho-Analysis of Children'' ends with the analysis of Mr. B., a gay man. Klein claimed that he illustrated pathologies that enter into all forms of homosexuality: a gay man idealizes \"the good penis\" of his partner to allay the fear of attack he feels due to having projected his paranoid hatred onto the imagined \"bad penis\" of his mother as an infant. She stated that Mr. B.'s homosexual behaviour diminished after he overcame his need to adore the \"good penis\" of an idealized man. This was made possible by his recovering his belief in the good mother and his ability to sexually gratify her with his good penis and plentiful [[semen]].<ref name=\"Lewes\" />\n\n==== Vote by European parliament in March 2018 ====\nIn March 2018, a majority of 435 against 109 representatives in the [[European Parliament|European parliament]] passed a resolution condemning conversion therapy and urging [[European Union]] member states to ban the practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=30751|title=EU-Parlament st\u00e4rkt LGBTI-Grundrechte|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://schwulissimo.de/politik/245183/EuropaeischesParlamentverurteiltdieHeilungvonHomosexuellen.htm|title=Schwulissimo - Europ\u00e4isches Parlament verurteilt die \"Heilung\" von Homosexuellen|website=schwulissimo.de|access-date=2018-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303050904/http://schwulissimo.de/politik/245183/EuropaeischesParlamentverurteiltdieHeilungvonHomosexuellen.htm|archive-date=2018-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/03/01/european-parliament-condemns-gay-cure-therapy-and-tells-eu-member-states-to-ban-it/|title=European Parliament condemns gay 'cure' therapy and tells EU member states to ban it|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n\n====20th century====\nPsychoanalysis started to receive recognition in the United States in 1909, when Sigmund Freud delivered a series of lectures at [[Clark University]] in [[Massachusetts]] at the invitation of [[G.

Brill criticised physical treatments for homosexuality such as bladder washing, [[rectum|rectal]] massage, and castration, along with [[hypnosis]], but referred approvingly to Freud and Sadger's use of psychoanalysis, calling its results \"very gratifying\".<ref name=KatzP149>{{Harvnb|Katz|1976|p=149}}</ref> Since Brill understood curing homosexuality as restoring heterosexual potency, he claimed that he had cured his patients in several cases, even though many remained homosexual.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /><ref name=\"Katz\">{{Harvnb|Katz|1976}}</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Stekel]], an Austrian, published his views on treatment of homosexuality, which he considered a disease, in the American ''[[National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis#Current ideology|Psychoanalytic Review]]'' in 1930. Stekel believed that \"success was fairly certain\" in changing homosexuality through psychoanalysis provided that it was performed correctly and the patient wanted to be treated. In 1932, ''The Psychoanalytic Quarterly'' published a translation of [[Helene Deutsch]]'s paper \"On Female Homosexuality\". Deutsch reported her analysis of a lesbian, who did not become heterosexual as a result of treatment, but who managed to achieve a \"positive libidinal relationship\" with another woman. Deutsch indicated that she would have considered heterosexuality a better outcome.<ref name=\"Katz\" />\n\n[[Edmund Bergler]] was the most important psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Lewes\" /> He was vociferous in his opposition to [[Alfred Kinsey]]. Kinsey's work, and its reception, led Bergler to develop his own theories for treatment, which were essentially to \"[[blame the victim]]\", in the evaluation of Jennifer Terry, associate professor of Woman's Studies.<ref name=\"Terry\"/> Bergler claimed that if gay people wanted to change, and the right therapeutic approach was taken, then they could be cured in 90% of cases.<ref name=\"BerglerTime\">{{Harvnb|Bergler|1956}}</ref> Bergler used confrontational therapy in which gay people were punished in order to make them aware of their masochism.

Activism against conversion therapy increasingly focused on the DSM's designation of homosexuality as a psychopathology.<ref name=\"RonaldBayer\" /> In 1973, after years of criticism from gay activists and bitter dispute among psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''. Supporters of the change used evidence from researchers such as Kinsey and [[Evelyn Hooker]]. Psychiatrist Robert Spitzer, a member of the APA's Committee on Nomenclature, played an important role in the events that led to this decision.

Cessation of the aversive stimuli was typically accompanied by the presentation of opposite-sex erotic images, with the objective of strengthening heterosexual feelings. In \"Aversion therapy for sexual deviation: a critical review\", published in 1966, M. P. Feldman claimed a 58% cure rate, but Douglas Haldeman is skeptical that such stressful methods permit feelings of sexual responsiveness, and notes that Feldman defined success as suppression of homosexuality and increased capacity for heterosexual behavior.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=152}}</ref>\n\nAnother method used was the covert sensitization method, which involves instructing patients to imagine vomiting or receiving electric shocks, writing that only single case studies have been conducted, and that their results cannot be generalized. Haldeman writes that behavioral conditioning studies tend to decrease homosexual feelings, but do not increase heterosexual feelings, citing Rangaswami's \"Difficulties in arousing and increasing heterosexual responsiveness in a homosexual: A case report\", published in 1982, as typical in this respect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=152\u2013153}}</ref>\n\nHaldeman concludes that such methods can be called [[torture]], besides being ineffective.

They advocated long-term therapy aimed at resolving the unconscious childhood conflicts that they considered responsible for homosexuality. Haldeman notes that Bieber's methodology has been criticized because it relied upon a clinical sample, the description of the outcomes was based upon subjective therapist impression, and follow-up data were poorly presented. Bieber reported a 27% success rate from long-term therapy, but only 18% of the patients in whom Bieber considered the treatment successful had been exclusively homosexual to begin with, while 50% had been bisexual. In Haldeman's view, this makes even Bieber's unimpressive claims of success misleading.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=150\u2013151}}</ref>\n\nHaldeman discusses other psychoanalytic studies of attempts to change homosexuality. Curran and Parr's \"Homosexuality: An analysis of 100 male cases\", published in 1957, reported no significant increase in heterosexual behavior. Mayerson and Lief's \"Psychotherapy of homosexuals: A follow-up study of nineteen cases\", published in 1965, reported that half of its 19 subjects were exclusively heterosexual in behavior four and a half years after treatment, but its outcomes were based on patient self-report and had no external validation. In Haldeman's view, those participants in the study who reported change were bisexual at the outset, and its authors wrongly interpreted capacity for heterosexual sex as change of sexual orientation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|pp=151, 256}}</ref>\n\n===Reparative therapy===\n\nThe term \"reparative therapy\" has been used as a synonym for conversion therapy generally, but according to Jack Drescher it properly refers to a specific kind of therapy associated with the psychologists [[Elizabeth Moberly]] and [[Joseph Nicolosi]].<ref name=\"Drescher1998\" /> The term ''reparative'' refers to Nicolosi's postulate that same-sex attraction is a person's unconscious attempt to \"self-repair\" feelings of inferiority.<ref name=Hicks_1999>{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=Karolyn Ann|title=\"Reparative Therapy\": Whether Parental Attempts to Change a Child's Sexual Orientation Can Legally Constitute Child Abuse|journal=American University Law Review|date=1999|volume=49|issue=2|pages=505\u2013547|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1288&context=aulr|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Nicolosi|first1=Joseph|title=What Is Reparative Therapy?

The original study did not describe the treatment methodology used, but this was published five years later. John C. Gonsiorek criticized their study on several grounds in 1981, pointing out that while Masters and Johnson stated that their patients were screened for major psychopathology or severe neurosis, they did not explain how this screening was performed, or how the motivation of the patients to change was assessed. Nineteen of their subjects were described as uncooperative during therapy and refused to participate in a follow-up assessment, but all of them were assumed without justification to have successfully changed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=154}}</ref>\n\nHaldeman writes that Masters and Johnson's study was founded on heterosexist bias, and that it would be tremendously difficult to replicate. In his view, the distinction Masters and Johnson made between \"conversion\" (helping gay men with no previous heterosexual experience to learn heterosexual sex) and \"reversion\" (directing men with some previous heterosexual experience back to heterosexuality) was not well founded. Many of the subjects Masters and Johnson labelled homosexual may not have been homosexual, since, of their participants, only 17% identified themselves as exclusively homosexual, while 83% were in the predominantly heterosexual to bisexual range. Haldeman observed that since 30% of the sample was lost to the follow-up, it is possible that the outcome sample did not include any people attracted mainly or exclusively to the same sex. Haldeman concludes that it is likely that, rather than converting or reverting gay people to heterosexuality, Masters and Johnson only strengthened heterosexual responsiveness in people who were already bisexual.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldeman|1991|p=155}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n{{main|Lobotomy}}\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, U.S. neurologist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] popularized the [[Lobotomy#Transorbital lobotomy|ice-pick lobotomy]] as a treatment for homosexuality.

The NFTS has since been funded by the UK Government, via (today) the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], and the television and film industries.\n\nKey Partner Sponsors include ODEON, the Film Distributors' Association and the UK Cinema Association in addition to the main UK [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] and [[satellite broadcasting]] companies [[BBC]], [[Channel 4]], [[Sky UK|Sky]], and [[S4C]]. In addition, a large number of public and private donors fund scholarships to assist (chiefly British and EU) students.\n\nPostgraduate students from the UK/EU/EEA can now apply for a loan to help with their studies at any UK university including the NFTS via the Student Loans Company \u2013 which will make a big difference for many who wish to come and study at the NFTS.\n\n==Courses of

'''National Film and Television School''' (NFTS) is a [[Film school|film, television and games school]] established in 1971 and based at [[Beaconsfield Film Studios|Beaconsfield Studios]] in [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, England. It is featured in the 2018 ranking by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' of the top 15 International film schools.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Top 15 International Film Schools |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/top-15-international-film-schools-1134439 |accessdate=20 January 2019 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=16 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIts community of students makes around a hundred and fifty films a year on courses that are over 90% practical and unlike courses offered at other UK film schools. As of 2017 it had over 400 students and about a thousand a year on its short courses. Beaconsfield Studios consists of film and television stages; animation and production design studios; edit suites; sound post-production facilities; a music recording studio and three dubbing theatres. The school completed an expansion and modernisation programme in early 2017 with new teaching facilities, a third cinema and a new 4K Television Studio.\n\nThe [[BBC]] stated that the NFTS was the \"leading centre of excellence for education in film and television programme making\", and noted that it was \"relevant to the industry's present and future needs.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=BBC - Press Office - BBC and NFTS work together to put new documentary talent on TV |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/03_march/06/talent.shtml |website=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref> British Film Magazine once described the NFTS as being one of the few schools to come \"very, very close\" to guaranteeing a job in the film industry, and named its leader (Powell) a \"maverick\";<ref>{{cite web |title=RING NIK POWELL AT NFTS |url=http://britishfilmmagazine.com/articles/ring-nik-powell-at-nfts.html |website=britishfilmmagazine.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214000437/http://britishfilmmagazine.com/articles/ring-nik-powell-at-nfts.html |archivedate=14 February 2008}}</ref> Filmmaking.net named it one of two films schools outside the US which had such a high international reputation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmmaking.net/filmmakers-faq/answer.php?id=123 |title=What are the best film schools? |publisher=filmmaking.net |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\nNFTS student films have been nominated for an Oscar three times in the last six years. Additionally, in 2017 NFTS graduation film, ''A Love Story,'' directed and co-written by Anushka Naanayakkara, won the British Short Animation BAFTA at the EE British Academy Film Awards making it the fourth year in a row that NFTS students have picked up this accolade.  This is the second consecutive year that two of NFTS students' graduation films competed for the same prize with ''A Love Story'' up against ''The Alan Dimension'' directed & co-written by Jac Clinch. NFTS student films are regularly selected for the top film festivals around the world. This year's highlights include selections at [[Cannes]] and [[Annecy Animation Festival]] and top prizes in nearly all the [[Royal Television Society]] categories for which they are eligible.{{when|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 2016 the National Film and Television School won accolades in all three categories in the CILECT Prize, the global film school awards. This is the third time that the NFTS has taken top place in these prestigious awards having also won two out of three categories in 2015, and in 2013, the school made history by becoming the first institution to win first prize in all three categories. This year, 117 film schools submitted entries, which were voted on by 107 of the world's major film and television schools from 57 countries.\n\nIn 2018, the school was the recipient of the ''\"[[BAFTA]] Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema Award\"'' award at the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title=NFTS - Special Award 2018 |url=http://www.bafta.org/film/features/nfts-special-award-2018 |website=www.bafta.org |accessdate=20 January 2019 |language=en |date=15 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bafta Film Awards 2018: All the winners |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42618239 |accessdate=20 January 2019 |date=18 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:NFTS New Front Building 2017 (Artist Impression).jpg|thumb|One of the new NFTS buildings to be opened in 2017 (artist's impression).]]\n\nThe National Film School opened in 1971, the work of four years of planning to create an institution to train personnel for the British film industry.

The Scottish [[Great Highland bagpipe]]s are the best known examples in the [[Anglophone world]]; however, people have played bagpipes for millennia, and they occur throughout large parts of [[Europe]], [[northern Africa]], and [[western Asia]], including [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], and around the [[Persian Gulf]]. The term ''bagpipe'' is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as \"the pipes\", \"a set of pipes\" or \"a stand of pipes\".\n\n== Construction ==\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen|filename=Skye Boat Song.ogg|title=Skye Boat Song|description=An adaptation of the \"[[Skye Boat Song]]\" for Great Highland bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.}}\n|}\n[[File:Cantiga bagpipes 1.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]  showing bagpipes with one chanter and a parallel drone (Spain, 13th century).]]\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 068.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] showing two bagpipers (15th century).]]\nA set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a [[chanter]], and usually at least one [[Drone (music)|drone]]. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks\u2014sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.\n\n=== Hi i\u2019m Jeff ===\nThe most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a [[non-return valve]] that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.\n\nAn innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a [[bellows]] to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called \"[[cauld wind pipes (disambiguation)|cauld wind pipes]]\", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish [[uilleann pipes]]; the [[border pipes|border or Lowland pipes]], [[Scottish smallpipes]], [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], [[pastoral pipes]] in Britain; and the [[musette de cour]], the [[musette bechonnet]] and the [[cabrette]] in France, the [[Dudy wielkopolskie]], [[koziol bialy]] and [[koziol czarny]] in Poland.\n\n=== Bag ===\nThe bag is an airtight [[reservoir]] that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including [[Gore-Tex]] have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of [[Respiratory tract infection|lung infection]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/bagpipe-warning-over-threat-of-fatal-fungus-1-2828835 |title=Bagpipe warning over threat of fatal fungus \u2013 Health |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2013-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> An advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.\n\nBags cut from larger materials are usually [[saddle stitch|saddle-stitched]] with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.\n\n=== Chanter ===\n{{Main|Chanter}}\nThe chanter is the [[melody]] pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, in the Balkans, and in Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or \"cylindrical\") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.\n\nThe chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant, [[legato]] sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or \"ornaments\") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the [[uilleann pipes]], the Northumbrian smallpipes, the [[Piva (bagpipe)|piva]] and the left chanter of the [[surdelina]]) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player \"closes\" (covers all the holes) the chanter becomes silent.\n\nA [[practice chanter]] is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.\n\nThe term ''chanter'' is derived from the Latin ''cantare'', or \"to sing\", much like the modern French word ''[[wikt:chanteur#French|chanteur]]''.\n\n==== Chanter reed ====\nThe note from the chanter is produced by a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] installed at its top. The reed may be a [[Single-reed instrument|single]] (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or [[double reed]] (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.\n\n=== Drone ===\nMost bagpipes have at least one [[drone (music)|drone]]: a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.\n\nDepending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient origins ===\nThe evidence for pre-Roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested. The ''Oxford History of Music''  says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a [[Hittites|Hittite]] slab at [[Euyuk]] in Anatolia, dated to 1000 BC. Several authors identify the [[ancient Greek]] ''askaulos'' (\u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''askos'' &ndash; [[wine-skin]], \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 ''[[aulos]]'' &ndash; reed pipe) with the bagpipe.<ref name=\"google15\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOfuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15 William Flood. \"The Story of the Bagpipe\" p. 15]</ref>  In the 2nd century AD, [[Suetonius]] described the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a player of the ''tibia utricularis''.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = ''Life of Nero'', 54\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#54\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = Suetonius, The Lives of the Caesars\n | page        = 185\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref> [[Dio Chrysostom]] wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe ([[Tibia (instrument)|tibia]], Roman reedpipes similar to Greek and Etruscan instruments) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = Discourses by Dio Chrysostom (Or.&nbsp;71.9)\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#9\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = The Seventy-first Discourse: On the Philosopher (Volume V)\n | volume      = V\n | page        = 173\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Spread and development in Europe ===\n[[File:Santes Creus Bagpiper.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval bagpiper at the [[Cistercian]] monastery of [[Santes Creus]], Catalonia, Spain]]\n[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate02.jpg|right|thumb|''Image of Irelande'', Military use of the bagpipe dated 1581]]\n\nIn the early part of the second millennium, definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography.

In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonald's ''Compleat Theory''. Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a [[William Dixon manuscript|William Dixon]] from [[Northumberland]] contains music that fits the [[border pipes]], a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern [[Great Highland bagpipe]]. However the music in Dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of [[Northumbrian smallpipe]] tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.''\n[[File:Merry brothers 1887.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Happy Brothers]]'' by [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]] (1887)]]\nAs Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.\n\nExtensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[International Bagpipe Museum]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]], Spain, the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in Oxford, England and the [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]] in Northumberland, and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Phoenix)|Musical Instrument Museum]] in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n[[File:MDF Strakonice 2018 09 Anglie 02.jpg|thumb|left|International Bagpipe Festival, Strakonice, 2018]]\n\nThe [[International Bagpipe Festival]] (''Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed dud\u00e1ck\u00fd festival'', '''IBF''', '''MDF''') is held every two years in [[Strakonice]], [[Czech Republic]].\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|right|A Canadian soldier plays the bagpipes during the War in Afghanistan. Bagpipes are frequently used during funerals and memorials, especially among fire department, military and police forces in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth realms, and the US.]]\nDuring the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland regiments]], the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth Nations]] such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the [[Great Highland bagpipe]] is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.\n\n[[File:Bagad Brest.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bagad]] in [[Brest, France]]]]\nIn recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In [[Brittany]], the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the [[pipe band]] were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the [[bagad]]. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the [[Galician bagpipe|Galician gaita]] as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' and the theatrical show ''[[Riverdance]]'' have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.\n\nBagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of [[curling]], bagpipes are also the official instrument of the [[World Curling Federation]] and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.\n\nBagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the world's biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010.<ref>{{Citation\n | first       = Caroline\n | last        = Jaine\n | authorlink  =\n | title       = Doing business with Pakistan\n | url         = http://www.dawn.com/news/663807/doing-business-with-pakistan\n | publisher   = [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | date        = 2011-10-04\n | accessdate  = 2013-02-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | last        = Abbas\n | first       = Nosheen\n | title       = The thriving bagpipe business of Pakistan\n | url         = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20876096\n | work   = [[BBC News Online]]\n | location    = [[Pakistan]]\n | date        = 2012-12-31\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n }}</ref> In the late 20th century, various models of [[electronic bagpipes]] were invented.

The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the [[Uilleann pipes|Irish piping tradition]], which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the [[gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]], the [[Galician gaita]], the Portuguese [[gaita transmontana]], the [[Aragon]]ese [[gaita de boto]], [[Northumbrian smallpipe]]s, the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[biniou]], the [[Balkan]] [[gaida]], the [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[cimpoi]],  the Black Sea [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]], the [[Scottish smallpipes]] and [[pastoral pipes]], as well as other varieties.[[File:Thechanter.jpg|thumb|A Great Highland bagpipe [[practice chanter]]]]Traditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.\n\n====Image gallery====\n<gallery>\nFile:BulgarianKabaGaidaPlayer.jpg|Bulgarian [[Kaba gaida]] player.\nFile:Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada, fall 2011.jpg|The Scottish Great Highland bagpipe played at a Canadian military function.\nFile:Baghet suonatore.jpg|A musician with a Northern Italian [[Bagh\u00e8t]] wearing traditional dress.\nFile:A modern model of Bagh\u00e8t.png|Modern Bagh\u00e8t (made 2000 by Valter Biella) in G.\nFile:Zampogna.jpg|Central and southern Italian [[zampogna]].\nFile:Tulumcu.jpg|[[Laz people|Laz]] man from Turkey playing a [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]].\nFile:Cillian Vallely on Uilleann Pipes.jpg|[[Cillian Vallely]] playing Irish Uilleann pipes.\nFile:Tickell 2004.jpg|[[Kathryn Tickell]] playing [[Northumbrian smallpipes]].\nFile:Gaida.jpg|Man from Skopje, North Macedonia playing the [[Gaida]].\nFile:Seivane1.jpg|[[Galician gaita]].\nFile:Sruti upanga.jpg|[[Sruti upanga]], a Southern Indian bagpipe.\nFile:Duda Bagpipe 001.jpg|Hungarian [[duda]].\nFile:Serbian bagpiper.jpg|Serbian piper.\nFile:DudyWielkopolskie.jpg|Polish pipers.\nFile:Bagad.JPG|[[Bagad]] of Lann Bihou\u00e9 from the French Navy.\nFile:Ollegallmo.jpg|Swedish [[s\u00e4ckpipa]].\nFile:Pastoral pipes removable foot joint.JPG|[[Pastoral pipes]] with removable footjoint and bellows.\nFile:Street-piper.jpg|Street piper from Sofia, Bulgaria.\nFile:Torupillim\u00e4ngija.jpg|Estonian [[torupill]] player.\nFile:Lithuanian bagpipes.png|Lithuanian piper.\nFile:Modern huemmelchen.jpg|Modern German [[huemmelchen]].\nFile:Lietuvi\u0161kas d\u016bdmai\u0161is (LNM).jpg|Lithuanian bagpipes.\nFile:Al son de la gaita.jpg|[[Gaita asturiana]].\nFile:Pibecwd.jpg|[[Welsh bagpipes]] (double-reed type).\nFile:Gaiteroscantabria.jpg|Cantabrian pipe band.\nFile:Bagpipe player damascus.jpg|Syrian piper in Damascus, Syria.\nFile:Tsambouna.jpg|Various forms of the [[Tsampouna]], found in the Greek islands.\nFile:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0456\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0435.jpg|Belarusian piper.\nFile:A \u017caqq (bagpipe), made from calf pelt, cane, and animal horn.jpg|Maltese [[\u017baqq]].\nFile:Bagpipe player Dam.jpg|Piper playing by the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]].\nFile:Cimpoi.png|Romanian [[cimpoi]] player.\nFile:\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka gra na dudach.webm|\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka playing bagpipes, Slovak Republic.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Usage in non-traditional music ===\n{{Main|List of nontraditional bagpipe usage}}\n[[File:Enter The Haggis Bagpipe.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic rock band [[Enter the Haggis]] featuring Highland bagpipes]]\nSince the 1960s, bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\", [[AC/DC]]'s \"[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]\", and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s composition ''[[An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise]]''. <!--STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THREE EXAMPLES TO BE PLACED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, PARTICULARLY AS THERE IS A LINK TO A COMPREHENSIVE LIST.

The Scottish [[Great Highland bagpipe]]s are the best known examples in the [[Anglophone world]]; however, people have played bagpipes for millennia, and they occur throughout large parts of [[Europe]], [[northern Africa]], and [[western Asia]], including [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], and around the [[Persian Gulf]]. The term ''bagpipe'' is equally correct in the singular or plural, though pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as \"the pipes\", \"a set of pipes\" or \"a stand of pipes\".\n\n== Construction ==\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen|filename=Skye Boat Song.ogg|title=Skye Boat Song|description=An adaptation of the \"[[Skye Boat Song]]\" for Great Highland bagpipes played by the Clan Stewart Pipe Band.}}\n|}\n[[File:Cantiga bagpipes 1.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]  showing bagpipes with one chanter and a parallel drone (Spain, 13th century).]]\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 068.jpg|thumb|right|A detail from a painting by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] showing two bagpipers (15th century).]]\nA set of bagpipes minimally consists of an air supply, a bag, a [[chanter]], and usually at least one [[Drone (music)|drone]]. Many bagpipes have more than one drone (and, sometimes, more than one chanter) in various combinations, held in place in stocks\u2014sockets that fasten the various pipes to the bag.\n\n=== Air supply ===\nThe most common method of supplying air to the bag is through blowing into a blowpipe or blowstick. In some pipes the player must cover the tip of the blowpipe with their tongue while inhaling, but most blowpipes have a [[non-return valve]] that eliminates this need. In recent times, there are many instruments that assist in creating a clean air flow to the pipes and assist the collection of condensation.\n\nAn innovation, dating from the 16th or 17th century, is the use of a [[bellows]] to supply air. In these pipes, sometimes called \"[[cauld wind pipes (disambiguation)|cauld wind pipes]]\", air is not heated or moistened by the player's breathing, so bellows-driven bagpipes can use more refined or delicate reeds. Such pipes include the Irish [[uilleann pipes]]; the [[border pipes|border or Lowland pipes]], [[Scottish smallpipes]], [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], [[pastoral pipes]] in Britain; and the [[musette de cour]], the [[musette bechonnet]] and the [[cabrette]] in France, the [[Dudy wielkopolskie]], [[koziol bialy]] and [[koziol czarny]] in Poland.\n\n=== Bag ===\nThe bag is an airtight [[reservoir]] that holds air and regulates its flow via arm pressure, allowing the player to maintain continuous even sound. The player keeps the bag inflated by blowing air into it through a blowpipe or pumping air into it with a bellows. Materials used for bags vary widely, but the most common are the skins of local animals such as goats, dogs, sheep, and cows. More recently, bags made of synthetic materials including [[Gore-Tex]] have become much more common. A drawback of the synthetic bag is the potential for fungal spores to colonise the bag because of a reduction in necessary cleaning, with the associated danger of [[Respiratory tract infection|lung infection]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/scotland/bagpipe-warning-over-threat-of-fatal-fungus-1-2828835 |title=Bagpipe warning over threat of fatal fungus \u2013 Health |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2013-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}</ref> An advantage of a synthetic bag is that it has a zip which allows the user to fit a more effective moisture trap to the inside of the bag.\n\nBags cut from larger materials are usually [[saddle stitch|saddle-stitched]] with an extra strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin bags) or glued (for synthetic bags) to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where the limbs and the head joined the body of the whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.\n\n=== Chanter ===\n{{Main|Chanter}}\nThe chanter is the [[melody]] pipe, played with two hands. Almost all bagpipes have at least one chanter; some pipes have two chanters, particularly those in North Africa, in the Balkans, and in Southwest Asia. A chanter can be bored internally so that the inside walls are parallel (or \"cylindrical\") for its full length, or it can be bored in a conical shape.\n\nThe chanter is usually open-ended, so there is no easy way for the player to stop the pipe from sounding. Thus most bagpipes share a constant, [[legato]] sound where there are no rests in the music. Primarily because of this inability to stop playing, technical movements are used to break up notes and to create the illusion of articulation and accents. Because of their importance, these embellishments (or \"ornaments\") are often highly technical systems specific to each bagpipe, and take many years of study to master. A few bagpipes (such as the musette de cour, the [[uilleann pipes]], the Northumbrian smallpipes, the [[Piva (bagpipe)|piva]] and the left chanter of the [[surdelina]]) have closed ends or stop the end on the player's leg, so that when the player \"closes\" (covers all the holes) the chanter becomes silent.\n\nA [[practice chanter]] is a chanter without bag or drones, allowing a player to practice the instrument quietly and with no variables other than playing the chanter.\n\nThe term ''chanter'' is derived from the Latin ''cantare'', or \"to sing\", much like the modern French word ''[[wikt:chanteur#French|chanteur]]''.\n\n==== Chanter reed ====\nThe note from the chanter is produced by a [[Reed (instrument)|reed]] installed at its top. The reed may be a [[Single-reed instrument|single]] (a reed with one vibrating tongue) or [[double reed]] (of two pieces that vibrate against each other). Double reeds are used with both conical- and parallel-bored chanters while single reeds are generally (although not exclusively) limited to parallel-bored chanters. In general, double-reed chanters are found in pipes of Western Europe while single-reed chanters appear in most other regions.\n\n=== Drone ===\nMost bagpipes have at least one [[drone (music)|drone]]: a pipe which is generally not fingered but rather produces a constant harmonizing note throughout play (usually the tonic note of the chanter). Exceptions are generally those pipes which have a double-chanter instead. A drone is most commonly a cylindrically-bored tube with a single reed, although drones with double reeds exist. The drone is generally designed in two or more parts with a sliding joint so that the pitch of the drone can be adjusted.\n\nDepending on the type of pipes, the drones may lie over the shoulder, across the arm opposite the bag, or may run parallel to the chanter. Some drones have a tuning screw, which effectively alters the length of the drone by opening a hole, allowing the drone to be tuned to two or more distinct pitches. The tuning screw may also shut off the drone altogether. In most types of pipes, where there is one drone it is pitched two octaves below the tonic of the chanter. Additional drones often add the octave below and then a drone consonant with the fifth of the chanter.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Ancient origins ===\nThe evidence for pre-Roman era bagpipes is still uncertain but several textual and visual clues have been suggested. The ''Oxford History of Music''  says that a sculpture of bagpipes has been found on a [[Hittites|Hittite]] slab at [[Euyuk]] in Anatolia, dated to 1000 BC. Several authors identify the [[ancient Greek]] ''askaulos'' (\u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''askos'' &ndash; [[wine-skin]], \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 ''[[aulos]]'' &ndash; reed pipe) with the bagpipe.<ref name=\"google15\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOfuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15 William Flood. \"The Story of the Bagpipe\" p. 15]</ref>  In the 2nd century AD, [[Suetonius]] described the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a player of the ''tibia utricularis''.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = ''Life of Nero'', 54\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#54\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = Suetonius, The Lives of the Caesars\n | page        = 185\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref> [[Dio Chrysostom]] wrote in the 1st century of a contemporary sovereign (possibly Nero) who could play a pipe ([[Tibia (instrument)|tibia]], Roman reedpipes similar to Greek and Etruscan instruments) with his mouth as well as by tucking a bladder beneath his armpit.<ref>{{Citation\n | title       = Discourses by Dio Chrysostom (Or.&nbsp;71.9)\n | url         = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/71*.html#9\n | publisher   = [[Loeb Classical Library]]\n | work       = The Seventy-first Discourse: On the Philosopher (Volume V)\n | volume      = V\n | page        = 173\n | date        =\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Spread and development in Europe ===\n[[File:Santes Creus Bagpiper.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval bagpiper at the [[Cistercian]] monastery of [[Santes Creus]], Catalonia, Spain]]\n[[File:The Image of Irelande - plate02.jpg|right|thumb|''Image of Irelande'', Military use of the bagpipe dated 1581]]\n\nIn the early part of the second millennium, definite clear attestations of bagpipes began to appear with frequency in Western European art and iconography.

In 1760, the first serious study of the Scottish Highland bagpipe and its music was attempted, in Joseph MacDonald's ''Compleat Theory''. Further south, a manuscript from the 1730s by a [[William Dixon manuscript|William Dixon]] from [[Northumberland]] contains music that fits the [[border pipes]], a nine-note bellows-blown bagpipe whose chanter is similar to that of the modern [[Great Highland bagpipe]]. However the music in Dixon's manuscript varied greatly from modern Highland bagpipe tunes, consisting mostly of extended variation sets of common dance tunes. Some of the tunes in the Dixon manuscript correspond to tunes found in early 19th century published and manuscript sources of [[Northumbrian smallpipe]] tunes, notably the rare book of 50 tunes, many with variations, by John Peacock.''\n[[File:Merry brothers 1887.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Happy Brothers]]'' by [[Uro\u0161 Predi\u0107]] (1887)]]\nAs Western classical music developed, both in terms of musical sophistication and instrumental technology, bagpipes in many regions fell out of favour due to their limited range and function. This triggered a long, slow decline that continued, in most cases, into the 20th century.\n\nExtensive and documented collections of traditional bagpipes can be found in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[International Bagpipe Museum]] in [[Gij\u00f3n]], Spain, the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] in Oxford, England and the [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]] in Northumberland, and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Phoenix)|Musical Instrument Museum]] in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n[[File:MDF Strakonice 2018 09 Anglie 02.jpg|thumb|left|International Bagpipe Festival, Strakonice, 2018]]\n\nThe [[International Bagpipe Festival]] (''Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed dud\u00e1ck\u00fd festival'', '''IBF''', '''MDF''') is held every two years in [[Strakonice]], [[Czech Republic]].\n\n=== Recent history ===\n[[File:Afghanistan bagpiper.jpg|thumb|right|A Canadian soldier plays the bagpipes during the War in Afghanistan. Bagpipes are frequently used during funerals and memorials, especially among fire department, military and police forces in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Commonwealth realms, and the US.]]\nDuring the expansion of the British Empire, spearheaded by British military forces that included [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland regiments]], the Scottish Great Highland bagpipe became well known worldwide. This surge in popularity was boosted by large numbers of pipers trained for military service in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The surge coincided with a decline in the popularity of many traditional forms of bagpipe throughout Europe, which began to be displaced by instruments from the classical tradition and later by gramophone and radio.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and [[Commonwealth Nations]] such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia the [[Great Highland bagpipe]] is commonly used in the military and is often played in formal ceremonies. Foreign militaries patterned after the British Army have also taken the Highland bagpipe into use including Uganda, Sudan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, and Oman. Many police and fire services in Scotland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United States have also adopted the tradition of fielding pipe bands.\n\n[[File:Bagad Brest.jpg|thumb|left|A [[bagad]] in [[Brest, France]]]]\nIn recent years, often driven by revivals of native folk music and dance, many types of bagpipes have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and, in many cases, instruments that were on the brink of obscurity have become extremely popular. In [[Brittany]], the Great Highland bagpipe and concept of the [[pipe band]] were appropriated to create a Breton interpretation, the [[bagad]]. The pipe band idiom has also been adopted and applied to the [[Galician bagpipe|Galician gaita]] as well. Additionally, bagpipes have often been used in various films depicting moments from Scottish and Irish history; the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' and the theatrical show ''[[Riverdance]]'' have served to make the uilleann pipes more commonly known.\n\nBagpipes are sometimes played at formal events in Commonwealth universities, particularly in Canada. Because of the Scottish influences on the sport of [[curling]], bagpipes are also the official instrument of the [[World Curling Federation]] and are commonly played during a ceremonial procession of teams before major curling championships.\n\nBagpipe making was once a craft that produced instruments in many distinctive local traditional styles. Today, the world's biggest producer of the instrument is Pakistan, where the industry was worth $6.8 million in 2010.<ref>{{Citation\n | first       = Caroline\n | last        = Jaine\n | authorlink  =\n | title       = Doing business with Pakistan\n | url         = http://www.dawn.com/news/663807/doing-business-with-pakistan\n | publisher   = [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | date        = 2011-10-04\n | accessdate  = 2013-02-02\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | last        = Abbas\n | first       = Nosheen\n | title       = The thriving bagpipe business of Pakistan\n | url         = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20876096\n | work   = [[BBC News Online]]\n | location    = [[Pakistan]]\n | date        = 2012-12-31\n | accessdate  = 2013-01-02\n }}</ref> In the late 20th century, various models of [[electronic bagpipes]] were invented.

The name bagpipe has almost become synonymous with its best-known form, the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], overshadowing the great number and variety of traditional forms of bagpipe. Despite the decline of these other types of pipes over the last few centuries, in recent years many of these pipes have seen a resurgence or revival as musicians have sought them out; for example, the [[Uilleann pipes|Irish piping tradition]], which by the mid 20th century had declined to a handful of master players is today alive, well, and flourishing a situation similar to that of the [[gaita asturiana|Asturian gaita]], the [[Galician gaita]], the Portuguese [[gaita transmontana]], the [[Aragon]]ese [[gaita de boto]], [[Northumbrian smallpipe]]s, the [[Breton people|Breton]] [[biniou]], the [[Balkan]] [[gaida]], the [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[cimpoi]],  the Black Sea [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]], the [[Scottish smallpipes]] and [[pastoral pipes]], as well as other varieties.[[File:Thechanter.jpg|thumb|A Great Highland bagpipe [[practice chanter]]]]Traditionally, one of the purposes of the bagpipe was to provide music for dancing. This has declined with the growth of dance bands, recordings, and the decline of traditional dance. In turn, this has led to many types of pipes developing a performance-led tradition, and indeed much modern music based on the dance music tradition played on bagpipes is no longer suitable for use as dance music.\n\n====Image gallery====\n<gallery>\nFile:BulgarianKabaGaidaPlayer.jpg|Bulgarian [[Kaba gaida]] player.\nFile:Bag piper, Padre, Currie Hall, Royal Military College of Canada, fall 2011.jpg|The Scottish Great Highland bagpipe played at a Canadian military function.\nFile:Baghet suonatore.jpg|A musician with a Northern Italian [[Bagh\u00e8t]] wearing traditional dress.\nFile:A modern model of Bagh\u00e8t.png|Modern Bagh\u00e8t (made 2000 by Valter Biella) in G.\nFile:Zampogna.jpg|Central and southern Italian [[zampogna]].\nFile:Tulumcu.jpg|[[Laz people|Laz]] man from Turkey playing a [[Tulum (bagpipe)|tulum]].\nFile:Cillian Vallely on Uilleann Pipes.jpg|[[Cillian Vallely]] playing Irish Uilleann pipes.\nFile:Tickell 2004.jpg|[[Kathryn Tickell]] playing [[Northumbrian smallpipes]].\nFile:Gaida.jpg|Man from Skopje, North Macedonia playing the [[Gaida]].\nFile:Seivane1.jpg|[[Galician gaita]].\nFile:Sruti upanga.jpg|[[Sruti upanga]], a Southern Indian bagpipe.\nFile:Duda Bagpipe 001.jpg|Hungarian [[duda]].\nFile:Serbian bagpiper.jpg|Serbian piper.\nFile:DudyWielkopolskie.jpg|Polish pipers.\nFile:Bagad.JPG|[[Bagad]] of Lann Bihou\u00e9 from the French Navy.\nFile:Ollegallmo.jpg|Swedish [[s\u00e4ckpipa]].\nFile:Pastoral pipes removable foot joint.JPG|[[Pastoral pipes]] with removable footjoint and bellows.\nFile:Street-piper.jpg|Street piper from Sofia, Bulgaria.\nFile:Torupillim\u00e4ngija.jpg|Estonian [[torupill]] player.\nFile:Lithuanian bagpipes.png|Lithuanian piper.\nFile:Modern huemmelchen.jpg|Modern German [[huemmelchen]].\nFile:Lietuvi\u0161kas d\u016bdmai\u0161is (LNM).jpg|Lithuanian bagpipes.\nFile:Al son de la gaita.jpg|[[Gaita asturiana]].\nFile:Pibecwd.jpg|[[Welsh bagpipes]] (double-reed type).\nFile:Gaiteroscantabria.jpg|Cantabrian pipe band.\nFile:Bagpipe player damascus.jpg|Syrian piper in Damascus, Syria.\nFile:Tsambouna.jpg|Various forms of the [[Tsampouna]], found in the Greek islands.\nFile:\u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0456\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0435.jpg|Belarusian piper.\nFile:A \u017caqq (bagpipe), made from calf pelt, cane, and animal horn.jpg|Maltese [[\u017baqq]].\nFile:Bagpipe player Dam.jpg|Piper playing by the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]].\nFile:Cimpoi.png|Romanian [[cimpoi]] player.\nFile:\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka gra na dudach.webm|\u013dubom\u00edr P\u00e1ri\u010dka playing bagpipes, Slovak Republic.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Usage in non-traditional music ===\n{{Main|List of nontraditional bagpipe usage}}\n[[File:Enter The Haggis Bagpipe.jpg|thumb|right|Celtic rock band [[Enter the Haggis]] featuring Highland bagpipes]]\nSince the 1960s, bagpipes have also made appearances in other forms of music, including rock, metal, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and classical music, for example with [[Paul McCartney]]'s \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\", [[AC/DC]]'s \"[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]\", and [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]'s composition ''[[An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise]]''. <!--STRONGLY RECOMMEND NO MORE THAN THREE EXAMPLES TO BE PLACED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, PARTICULARLY AS THERE IS A LINK TO A COMPREHENSIVE LIST.
