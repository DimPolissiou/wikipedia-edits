Known for pioneering a change in the portrayal of women in [[Bollywood|Hindi cinema]] with her roles in female-led films, she is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Vidya Balan|several awards]], including a [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and six [[Filmfare Awards]]. She was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] by the [[Government of India]] in 2014.\n\nVidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom ''[[Hum Paanch (TV series)|Hum Paanch]]''. She pursued a master's degree in sociology from the [[University of Mumbai]] and simultaneously made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film. She subsequently featured in television commercials and music videos. In 2003 she made her feature film debut by starring in the independent [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengal]]i drama ''[[Bhalo Theko]]''. Vidya subsequently received praise for her first Hindi film, the drama ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]'', and followed it with a leading role in the top-grossing comedy film ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'' (2006).\n\nThis breakthrough was followed by roles in the romantic comedies ''[[Heyy Babyy]]'' (2007) and ''[[Kismat Konnection]]'' (2008) which had negative reviews. Vidya went on to establish herself by playing five consecutive roles to critical acclaim in the 2009 drama ''[[Paa (film)|Paa]]'', the 2010 black comedy ''[[Ishqiya]]'', the 2011 semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'', the 2011 biopic ''[[The Dirty Picture]]'', and the 2012 thriller ''[[Kahaani]]'', winning several awards for each of them. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office, although her performance in ''[[Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh]]'' (2016) was praised. This changed when she starred as a radio jockey in ''[[Tumhari Sulu]]'' (2017) and a scientist in ''[[Mission Mangal]]'' (2019). The latter ranks as her highest-grossing release.\n\nVidya also promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She is a member of the Indian [[Central Board of Film Certification]] and hosts a radio show. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and dress sense, but was later credited in the media for her unconventionality. Vidya is married to the film producer [[Siddharth Roy Kapur]].\n\n==Early life and initial career struggles==\nVidya was born on 1 January 1979 in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (present-day Mumbai),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://in.style.yahoo.com/real-age-vidya-balan-not-wikipedia-saying-100458995.html |title=This Is Real Age Of Vidya Balan And Not What Wikipedia Is Saying |publisher=Yahoo Lifestyle |accessdate=6 December 2016 |date=6 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206114826/https://in.style.yahoo.com/real-age-vidya-balan-not-wikipedia-saying-100458995.html |archivedate=6 December 2016 |df= }}</ref> to parents of [[Tamil people|Tamilian]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Temple wedding for Vidya Balan and Siddharth Roy Kapur |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/temple-wedding-for-vidya-balan-and-siddharth-roy-kapur-630333 |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2015 |publisher=NDTV |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524154305/http://movies.ndtv.com/bollywood/temple-wedding-for-vidya-balan-and-siddharth-roy-kapur-630333 |archivedate=24 May 2015 |df= }}</ref> Her father, P.

Known for pioneering a change in the portrayal of women in [[Bollywood|Hindi cinema]] with her roles in female-led films, she is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Vidya Balan|several awards]], including a [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and six [[Filmfare Awards]]. She was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] by the [[Government of India]] in 2014.\n\nVidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom ''[[Hum Paanch (TV series)|Hum Paanch]]''. She pursued a master's degree in sociology from the [[University of Mumbai]] and simultaneously made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film. She subsequently featured in television commercials and music videos. In 2003 she made her feature film debut by starring in the independent [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengal]]i drama ''[[Bhalo Theko]]''. Vidya subsequently received praise for her first Hindi film, the drama ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]'', and followed it with a leading role in the top-grossing comedy film ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'' (2006).\n\nThis breakthrough was followed by roles in the romantic comedies ''[[Heyy Babyy]]'' (2007) and ''[[Kismat Konnection]]'' (2008) which had negative reviews. Vidya went on to establish herself by playing five consecutive roles to critical acclaim in the 2009 drama ''[[Paa (film)|Paa]]'', the 2010 black comedy ''[[Ishqiya]]'', the 2011 semi-biographical thriller ''[[No One Killed Jessica]]'', the 2011 biopic ''[[The Dirty Picture]]'', and the 2012 thriller ''[[Kahaani]]'', winning several awards for each of them. She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office, although her performance in ''[[Kahaani 2: Durga Rani Singh]]'' (2016) was praised. This changed when she starred as a radio jockey in ''[[Tumhari Sulu]]'' (2017) and a scientist in ''[[Mission Mangal]]'' (2019). The latter ranks as her highest-grossing release.\n\nVidya also promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She is a member of the Indian [[Central Board of Film Certification]] and hosts a radio show. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and dress sense, but was later credited in the media for her unconventionality.

Additionally, it has large affluent residential neighborhoods, some with [[cobblestone]] streets and buildings that are over 100 years old.

Since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], long convoys had transported slaves as well as all sorts of products to be used for [[barter]]. To protect against attacks from desert nomads, slaves were used as an escort.

From the evidence of illustrated documents, and travellers' tales, it seems that people travelled on [[dhow]]s or ''[[jalba]]s'', Arab ships which were used as transport in the Red Sea. Crossing the Indian Ocean required better organisation and more resources than overland transport. Ships coming from Zanzibar made stops on [[Socotra]] or at [[Aden]] before heading to the [[Persian Gulf]] or to India. Slaves were sold as far away as India, or even China: there was a colony of Arab merchants in [[Guangzhou|Canton]].

The trade in black slaves was part of a diverse commercial network.

In 1416, al-Maqrizi told how pilgrims coming from [[Takrur]] (near the [[Senegal River]]) brought 1,700 slaves with them to [[Mecca]]. In North Africa, the main slave markets were in Morocco, [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]] and Cairo. Sales were held in public places or in [[Souq|souks]].\n\nPotential buyers made a careful examination of the \"merchandise\": they checked the state of health of a person who was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving [[eunuch]]s and [[concubine]]s happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship ''Ternate'', visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description:\n{{quote|'The show' commences about four o'clock in the afternoon. The slaves, set off to the best advantage by having their skins cleaned and burnished with cocoa-nut oil, their faces painted with red and white stripes and the hands, noses, ears and feet ornamented with a profusion of bracelets of gold and silver and jewels, are ranged in a line, commencing with the youngest, and increasing to the rear according to their size and age. At the head of this file, which is composed of all sexes and ages from 6 to 60, walks the person who owns them; behind and at each side, two or three of his domestic slaves, armed with swords and spears, serve as guard.\n\nThus ordered the procession begins, and passes through the market-place and the principle streets... when any of them strikes a spectator's fancy the line immediately stops, and a process of examination ensues, which, for minuteness, is unequalled in any cattle market in Europe. The intending purchaser having ascertained there is no defect in the faculties of speech, hearing, etc., that there is no disease present, next proceeds to examine the person; the mouth and the teeth are first inspected and afterwards every part of the body in succession, not even excepting the breasts, etc., of the girls, many of whom I have seen handled in the most indecent manner in the public market by their purchasers; indeed there is every reasons to believe that the slave-dealers almost universally force the young girls to submit to their lust previous to their being disposed of.

For one thing, specialists are undecided on the number of Africans taken from their homes; this is difficult to resolve because of a lack of reliable statistics: there was no census system in medieval Africa. Archival material for the transatlantic trade in the 16th to 18th centuries may seem useful as a source, yet these record books were often falsified. Historians have to use imprecise narrative documents to make estimates which must be treated with caution: Luiz Felipe de Alencastro states that there were 8 million slaves taken from Africa between the 8th and 19th centuries along the Oriental and the [[Trans-Saharan trade|Trans-Saharan]] routes.<ref>Luiz Felipe de Alencastro, \"Traite\", in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis'' (2002), corpus 22, page 902.</ref>\n\nOlivier P\u00e9tr\u00e9-Grenouilleau has put forward a figure of 17 million African people enslaved (in the same period and from the same area) on the basis of Ralph Austen's work.<ref>Ralph Austen, ''African Economic History'' (1987)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2015}} [[Ronald Segal]] estimates between 11.5 and 14 million were enslaved by the Arab slave trade.<ref>Quoted in [http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#ISlave Ronald Segal's ''Islam's Black Slaves'']</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/03/04/reviews/010304.04hochsct.html| title=Human Cargo|date=Mar 4, 2001|author=Adam Hochschild|accessdate=Dec 20, 2012|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora|author=Ronald Segal|year=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0374527976|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/islamsblackslave00sega}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2015}} Other estimates place it around 11.2 million.<ref>Maddison, Angus.

In the Maghreb, slaves were swapped for horses. In the desert cities, lengths of cloth, pottery, [[Venetian glass]] [[Trade bead|slave beads]], dyestuffs and jewels were used as payment. The trade in black slaves was part of a diverse commercial network. Alongside gold coins, [[Cowry|cowrie shells]] from the Indian Ocean or the Atlantic ([[Canary Islands|Canaries]], [[Luanda]]) were used as money throughout sub-saharan Africa (merchandise was paid for with sacks of cowries).<ref>{{cite book |authors=Jan Hogendorn and Marion Johnson |title=The Shell Money of the Slave Trade |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/regional-history-after-1500/shell-money-slave-trade |location=[[Cambridge]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |date=1986 |isbn=9780521541107 |access-date=29 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Slave markets and fairs===\n\n[[File:Slave market Khartoum 19th c.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A slave market in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, c. 1876.]]\n\nEnslaved Africans were sold in the towns of the [[Arab World]]. In 1416, al-Maqrizi told how pilgrims coming from [[Takrur]] (near the [[Senegal River]]) brought 1,700 slaves with them to [[Mecca]]. In North Africa, the main slave markets were in Morocco, [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]] and Cairo. Sales were held in public places or in [[Souq|souks]].\n\nPotential buyers made a careful examination of the \"merchandise\": they checked the state of health of a person who was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving [[eunuch]]s and [[concubine]]s happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship ''Ternate'', visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description:\n{{quote|'The show' commences about four o'clock in the afternoon. The slaves, set off to the best advantage by having their skins cleaned and burnished with cocoa-nut oil, their faces painted with red and white stripes and the hands, noses, ears and feet ornamented with a profusion of bracelets of gold and silver and jewels, are ranged in a line, commencing with the youngest, and increasing to the rear according to their size and age. At the head of this file, which is composed of all sexes and ages from 6 to 60, walks the person who owns them; behind and at each side, two or three of his domestic slaves, armed with swords and spears, serve as guard.\n\nThus ordered the procession begins, and passes through the market-place and the principle streets... when any of them strikes a spectator's fancy the line immediately stops, and a process of examination ensues, which, for minuteness, is unequalled in any cattle market in Europe. The intending purchaser having ascertained there is no defect in the faculties of speech, hearing, etc., that there is no disease present, next proceeds to examine the person; the mouth and the teeth are first inspected and afterwards every part of the body in succession, not even excepting the breasts, etc., of the girls, many of whom I have seen handled in the most indecent manner in the public market by their purchasers; indeed there is every reasons to believe that the slave-dealers almost universally force the young girls to submit to their lust previous to their being disposed of. From such scenes one turns away with pity and indignation.<ref>{{Citation|last=Moorehead|first=Alan|title=The White Nile|year=1960|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|pages=11\u201312|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_White_Nile.html?id=rBDHGXK1CKcC|isbn=9780060956394}}</ref>}}\n\n===Towns and ports involved in the slave trade===\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[North Africa]]:\n** [[Tangier]] ([[Morocco]])\n** [[Marrakesh]] ([[Morocco]])\n** [[Algiers]] ([[Algeria]])\n** [[Tripoli]] ([[Libya]])\n** [[Cairo]] ([[Egypt]])\n** [[Aswan]] ([[Egypt]])\n* [[West Africa]]:\n** [[Aoudaghost]] ([[Mauritania]])\n** [[Timbuktu]] ([[Mali]])\n** [[Gao]] ([[Mali]])\n** [[Bilma]] ([[Niger]])\n** [[Kano]] ([[Nigeria]])\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[Swahili Coast]]:\n** [[Bagamoyo]] ([[Tanzania]])\n** [[Zanzibar]] ([[Tanzania]])\n** [[Kilwa District|Kilwa]] ([[Tanzania]])\n** [[Sofala]] ([[Beira, Mozambique]])\n** [[Mombasa]] ([[Kenya]])\n* [[Horn of Africa]]:\n** [[Assab]] ([[Eritrea]])\n** [[Massawa]] ([[Eritrea]])\n** [[Nefasit]] ([[Eritrea]])\n**[[Tadjoura]] ([[Djibouti]])\n** [[Zeila]] ([[Somalia]])\n** [[Mogadishu]] ([[Somalia]])\n** [[Kismayo]] ([[Somalia]])\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* [[Arabian Peninsula]]:\n**[[Jeddah]] ([[Saudi Arabia]])\n** [[Zab\u012bd]] ([[Yemen]])\n** [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] ([[Oman]])\n** [[Aden]] ([[Yemen]])\n** [[Socotra]] ([[Indian Ocean]])\n* [[Indian Ocean]]:\n** [[Debal]] ([[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]])\n** [[Karachi]] ([[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]])\n** [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] ([[India]])\n** [[Surat]] ([[India]])\n** [[Mandvi]], [[Kutch]] (India)\n|}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see also|Afro-Arab}}\nThe history of the slave trade has given rise to numerous debates amongst historians. For one thing, specialists are undecided on the number of Africans taken from their homes; this is difficult to resolve because of a lack of reliable statistics: there was no census system in medieval Africa. Archival material for the transatlantic trade in the 16th to 18th centuries may seem useful as a source, yet these record books were often falsified. Historians have to use imprecise narrative documents to make estimates which must be treated with caution: Luiz Felipe de Alencastro states that there were 8 million slaves taken from Africa between the 8th and 19th centuries along the Oriental and the [[Trans-Saharan trade|Trans-Saharan]] routes.<ref>Luiz Felipe de Alencastro, \"Traite\", in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis'' (2002), corpus 22, page 902.</ref>\n\nOlivier P\u00e9tr\u00e9-Grenouilleau has put forward a figure of 17 million African people enslaved (in the same period and from the same area) on the basis of Ralph Austen's work.<ref>Ralph Austen, ''African Economic History'' (1987)</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2015}} [[Ronald Segal]] estimates between 11.5 and 14 million were enslaved by the Arab slave trade.<ref>Quoted in [http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#ISlave Ronald Segal's ''Islam's Black Slaves'']</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/03/04/reviews/010304.04hochsct.html| title=Human Cargo|date=Mar 4, 2001|author=Adam Hochschild|accessdate=Dec 20, 2012|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora|author=Ronald Segal|year=2002|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0374527976|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/islamsblackslave00sega}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2015}} Other estimates place it around 11.2 million.<ref>Maddison, Angus.
