The KB collects everything that appears in and about the Netherlands, from [[medieval literature]] to today's publications. About 7 million publications are stored in the warehouse, including books, newspapers and magazines. The KB also offers many digital services, such as the national online Library (with e-books and audiobooks) and [[Delpher]] (millions of digitized pages). Since 2015, the KB has played a coordinating role for the network of the public library.\n\n== History ==\nThe initiative to found a national library was proposed by representative Albert Jan Verbeek on August 17, 1798. The collection would be based on the confiscated book collection of [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pwrb.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2018/02/13/national-library-of-the-netherlands/|title=National Library of The Netherlands|date=2018-02-13|website=Preserving the World's Rarest Books|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=J.

The National Library was initially only open to members of the Representative Body.\n\nKing [[Louis Bonaparte]] gave the [[national library]] its name of the Royal Library in 1806. Napoleon Bonaparte transferred the Royal Library to The Hague as property, while also allowing the Imperial Library in Paris to expropriate publications from the Royal Library. In 1815 King [[William I of the Netherlands]] confirmed the name of 'Royal Library' (Dutch: Koninklijke Bibliotheek) by [[Royal resolution (Netherlands)|royal resolution]]. It has been known as the National Library of the Netherlands since 1982, when it opened new quarters.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=Chicago}}</ref> The institution became 'Independent Administrative Body' of the state in 1996, although it is financed by the Department of [[Education]], [[Culture]] and [[Science]]. On 18 November 2014 the Wsob (Public Library Facilities System Act or 'Library Act') came into being. The act became valid on 1 January 2015 and from this moment onwards four organizations from the library world continued under the name Koninklijke Bibliotheek. These organizations are Sector Institute Public Libraries (SIOB), the Foundation Bibliotheek.nl (BNL), the Digital Library for Dutch Literature (DBNL) and the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB).\n\n== Collection ==\nThe humanities are central to the collection of the KB, with an emphasis on Dutch history, language and culture.\n\nIn 2016, the KB contained 7,000,000 items, equivalent to 115 kilometers of bookshelves. Most items in the collection are books. There are also pieces of \"[[grey literature]]\", where the author, publisher, or date may not be apparent but the document has cultural or intellectual significance.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The collection contains almost the entire literature of the [[Netherlands]], from medieval manuscripts to modern scientific publications. For a publication to be accepted, it must be from a registered Dutch publisher.<ref name=\"auto\" /> \n\nThe collection is accessible for members. Any person aged 16 years or older can become a member. One day passes are also available. Requests for material take approximately 30 [[minute]]s. The KB hosts several open access websites, including the \"Memory of the Netherlands\" (''Geheugen van Nederland'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://geheugen.delpher.nl/en/geheugen/pages/webpage/over+het+geheugen|title=Image database - Memory of the Netherlands - Online image database of archives, museums and libraries|work=geheugenvannederland.nl}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nThe KB's Research Department is engaged in internationally renowned research in the field of digital technology, sustainable preservation and accessibility of both paper and digital heritage.

The official name is KB, National Library of the Netherlands. The KB collects everything that appears in and about the Netherlands, from medieval literature to today's publications. About 7 million publications are stored in the warehouse, books, newspapers and magazines. The KB also offers many digital services, such as the national online Library (with e-books and audiobooks) and [[Delpher]] (millions of digitized pages). Since 2015, the KB has played a coordinating role for the network of the public library.\n\n== History ==\nThe initiative to found a national library was proposed by representative Albert Jan Verbeek on August 17, 1798. The collection would be based on the confiscated book collection of [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pwrb.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2018/02/13/national-library-of-the-netherlands/|title=National Library of The Netherlands|date=2018-02-13|website=Preserving the World's Rarest Books|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=J.

The National Library was initially only open to members of the Representative Body.\n\nKing [[Louis Bonaparte]] gave the [[national library]] its name of the Royal Library in 1806. Napoleon Bonaparte transferred the Royal Library to The Hague as property, while also allowing the Imperial Library in Paris to expropriate publications from the Royal Library. In 1815 King [[William I of the Netherlands]] confirmed the name of 'Royal Library' (Dutch: Koninklijke Bibliotheek) by [[Royal resolution (Netherlands)|royal resolution]]. It has been known as the National Library of the Netherlands since 1982, when it opened new quarters.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=Chicago}}</ref> The institution became 'Independent Administrative Body' of the state in 1996, although it is financed by the Department of [[Education]], [[Culture]] and [[Science]]. On 18 November 2014 the Wsob (Public Library Facilities System Act or 'Library Act') came into being. The act became valid on 1 January 2015 and from this moment onwards four organizations from the library world continued under the name Koninklijke Bibliotheek. These organizations are Sector Institute Public Libraries (SIOB), the Foundation Bibliotheek.nl (BNL), the Digital Library for Dutch Literature (DBNL) and the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB).\n\n== Collection ==\nThe humanities are central to the collection of the KB, with an emphasis on Dutch history, language and culture.\n\nIn 2016, the KB contained 7,000,000 items, equivalent to 115 kilometers of bookshelves. Most items in the collection are books. There are also pieces of \"[[grey literature]]\", where the author, publisher, or date may not be apparent but the document has cultural or intellectual significance.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The collection contains almost the entire literature of the [[Netherlands]], from medieval manuscripts to modern scientific publications. For a publication to be accepted, it must be from a registered Dutch publisher.<ref name=\"auto\" /> \n\nThe collection is accessible for members. Any person aged 16 years or older can become a member. One day passes are also available. Requests for material take approximately 30 [[minute]]s.
