In its time, year 1 was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Paullus''', named after [[Roman consul]]s [[Gaius Caesar]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and less frequently, as year '''754 AUC''' (''[[ab urbe condita]]'') within the [[Roman Empire]]. The denomination \"AD 1\" for this year has been in consistent use since the mid-[[Middle Ages|medieval period]] when the anno Domini (AD) calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. It was the beginning of the [[Anno Domini|Christian]]/[[Common Era|Common]] era. The preceding year is [[1 BC]]; there is no [[Year zero|year 0]] in this numbering scheme. The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in [[AD 525]] by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].\n\nThe [[Julian calendar]], a [[45 BC]] reform of the [[Roman calendar]], was the calendar used by Rome in AD 1.\n\n== Events ==\n\n=== By place ===\n\n==== Roman Empire ====\n* [[Tiberius]], under order of Emperor [[Augustus]], quells revolts in [[Germania]] (AD 1\u2013[[AD 5|5]]).\n* Gaius Caesar marries [[Livilla]], daughter of [[Antonia Minor]] and [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], in an effort to gain prestige.\n* [[Quirinius]] becomes a chief advisor to Gaius in Armenia.

During this three-year development period Daewoo was struggling financially, with the ultimate fate of the company and the concept vehicle remaining uncertain.\n\nThe Kalos was sold in three and four available body styles: a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback from the beginning of production in 2002, and a 3-door hatchback available in certain European markets beginning in 2005. Two different T200 front-end styling designs were sold. When released in 2002, the T200 headlamps were detached from the horizontal amber turn signal strip, located directly below. This detached style, used primarily in South Korea and North America, was used in conjunction with a semi-elliptical [[grille]]. When sales in Europe began in 2003, the headlights were an integrated unit that slanted upwards from the \"V-shaped\" grille towards the [[fender (vehicle)|front fenders]]. In Australia, when the Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2003, the hatchback featured the integrated lighting arrangement, with the detached style used to differentiate the sedans. In South Korea, where the detached lights were used at first, the integrated design was later utilized as a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]].\n\nThe T200 sedan and five-door hatchback featured a [[swage#Car styling swage line|swage line]] running along the lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door. Five-doors also feature a side window in the [[C pillar|C/D pillar]] with a distinctively angled lower edge.

During this three-year development period Daewoo was struggling financially, with the ultimate fate of the company and the concept vehicle remaining uncertain.\n\nThe Kalos was sold in three and four available body styles: a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatchback from the beginning of production in 2002, and a 3-door hatchback available in certain European markets beginning in 2005. Two different T200 front-end styling designs were sold. When released in 2002, the T200 headlamps were detached from the horizontal amber turn signal strip, located directly below. This detached style, used primarily in South Korea and North America, was used in conjunction with a semi-elliptical [[grille]]. When sales in Europe began in 2003, the headlights were an integrated unit that slanted upwards from the \"V-shaped\" grille towards the [[fender (vehicle)|front fenders]]. In Australia, when the Daewoo Kalos was introduced in 2003, the hatchback featured the integrated lighting arrangement, with the detached style used to differentiate the sedans. In South Korea, where the detached lights were used at first, the integrated design was later utilized as a [[facelift (automotive)|facelift]].\n\nThe T200 sedan and five-door hatchback featured a [[swage#Car styling swage line|swage line]] running along the lower body to the rear door, which kinks downward prominently on the five-door.
