In 1971 it became the Palmerston North Technical Institute and in 1983 the [[Manawatu]] Polytechnic. At the time it specialised in trade  [[apprenticeship]] courses, and in hobby, art, and  craft classes, along with a range of night school programmes in [[business studies]] for working adults.\n\nAs successive governments placed emphasis on vocational education, the Polytechnic broadened the courses offered, but retained a focus on core [[vocational education|vocational programmes]]. It now delivers Foundation and Certificate programmes, Diplomas, Degrees and Post-Graduate options in a range of subjects as well as community based programmes.\n\nIn 1987 the Manawatu Polytechnic opened a small campus in [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]] and the 1996 approval by government of a [[New Zealand dollar|$]]22 million capital injection, enabled the rebuilding and consolidation of the Palmerston North campus onto a central city site.\n\nIn late 1998 the Manawatu Polytechnic changed its name to the Universal College of Learning (UCOL). UCOL expanded in January 2001 with the incorporation of the [[Wairarapa|Masterton]] Regional Polytechnic and the integration of the [[Wanganui]] Regional Community Polytechnic on 1 April 2002. On 1 April 2020, UCOL was subsumed into [[New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology]] alongside the 15 other Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kenny |first1=Lee |title=Wanted: 'Sophisticated' leader to head NZ's mega polytech |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/116969565/wanted-sophisticated-leader-to-head-nzs-mega-polytech |accessdate=7 March 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=29 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThere are four campuses: [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/Campus-details/Palmerston-North Palmerston North], [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/Campus-details/whanganui Whanganui], [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/Campus-details/wairarapa Masterton] and [http://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/Campus-details/levin Levin].\n\n=== Palmerston North campus facilities ===\n* [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/programmes/language-culture/toefl-ibt-test TOEFL iBT Testing Centre]\n* [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/Campus-details/Palmerston-North/Ambitions-Training-Restaurant Ambitions Training Restaurant]\n* [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/campus-details/palmerston-north/hair-and-beauty Hair and Beauty Salon]\n* [http://olympicweightlifting.nz/affiliated-clubs/ Palmerston North Weightlifting Club (affiliated with Olympic Weightlifting New Zealand) ]\n\n=== Whanganui campus facilities ===\n* [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/campus-details/whanganui/visions-training-restaurant Visions Training Restaurant]\n* [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/campus-details/whanganui/hair-and-beauty Hair and Beauty Salon]\n\n=== Masterton campus facilities ===\n* [https://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/campus-details/wairarapa/hair-and-beauty Hair and Beauty Salon]\n\n== Strategic priorities ==\nUCOL is focused on delivering the six priorities of the Tertiary Education Strategy 2014\u20132019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.govt.nz/further-education/policies-and-strategies/tertiary-education-strategy/|title=Tertiary Education Strategy 2014 \u2013 2019|last=Zealand|first=Education in New|website=Education in New Zealand|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-03-24}}</ref>\n* Delivering skills for industry\n* Getting at-risk young people into a career\n* [http://www.ucol.ac.nz/study-at-ucol/maori-pasifika Boosting achievement of M\u0101ori and Pasifika]\n* Improving adult literacy and numeracy\n* Strengthening researched-based institutions\n* [http://www.ucol.ac.nz/international-students/International-Accreditations Growing international linkages]\n\n== Relationships-based teaching ==\nUCOL is the first to employ a relationships-based teaching approach in a tertiary education setting.
