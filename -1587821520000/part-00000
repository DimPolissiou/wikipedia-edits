She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence originated the Mama character, which first appeared in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' that aired on [[CBS]] from 1967 until 1978. In 1982, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' was a made-for-TV movie based on \"The Family\" sketches characters. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (first on [[NBC]], then revolutionized in [[first-run syndication]]), and finally in the ongoing ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''. With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the \"Mama\" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'';<ref name=\"1of100\">Handleman, Jay (21 February 2003).

She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]]. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of ''Mama's Family''; she wore no support hose during ''The Family'' sketches nor the ''Eunice'' movie.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=758mUmQxV6gC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+Mama's+orthopedic+shoes&source=bl&ots=duy-zxLKkw&sig=So6pPTb4V_ZePwU42hrRObEh4K8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OvM5UfumGqrr2QWShIEY&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Vicki%20Lawrence%20Mama's%20orthopedic%20shoes&f=false |title=Funny Ladies - Michael Karol - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> For [[footwear]], Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled]] [[brogue shoe|brogue]] style.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=Mama's+Family+Thelma+Harper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iPA5Ua3WH4bk2AWnw4GgCw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Mama's%20Family%20Thelma%20Harper&f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]]: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \n \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral [[headpiece]]s; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\n==Mama's persona==\n\n===Vicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution===\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between ''The Family'' sketches and the first life of ''Mama's Family''. Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from ''The Family'' sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in ''The Family'' sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn ''[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]'' sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of ''The Family'' sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.

She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch.

She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South. Vicki Lawrence is the actress who originated the Mama character, which first appeared in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' that aired on [[CBS]] from 1967 until 1978. In 1982, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'' was a made-for-TV movie based on \"The Family\" sketches characters. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' (first on [[NBC]], then revolutionized in [[first-run syndication]]), and finally in the ongoing ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''. With Lawrence continuing to play the role into the present day, the \"Mama\" character has made numerous other post-television show appearances, such as on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[The Talk (TV series)|The Talk]]'';<ref name=\"1of100\">Handleman, Jay (21 February 2003).

She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]]. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of ''Mama's Family''; she wore no support hose during ''The Family'' sketches nor the ''Eunice'' movie.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=758mUmQxV6gC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+Mama's+orthopedic+shoes&source=bl&ots=duy-zxLKkw&sig=So6pPTb4V_ZePwU42hrRObEh4K8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OvM5UfumGqrr2QWShIEY&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Vicki%20Lawrence%20Mama's%20orthopedic%20shoes&f=false |title=Funny Ladies - Michael Karol - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> For [[footwear]], Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled]] [[brogue shoe|brogue]] style.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=Mama's+Family+Thelma+Harper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iPA5Ua3WH4bk2AWnw4GgCw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Mama's%20Family%20Thelma%20Harper&f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]]: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \n \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral [[headpiece]]s; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\n==Mama's persona==\n\n===Vicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution===\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between ''The Family'' sketches and the first life of ''Mama's Family''. Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from ''The Family'' sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in ''The Family'' sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn ''[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]'' sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of ''The Family'' sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.

She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch.

He guided Leicester City to the [[Football League Cup]] final three times, winning twice. As Celtic manager between 2000 and 2005, he led that club to three [[Scottish Premier League]] titles and the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]]. After joining [[Aston Villa]] he achieved three consecutive sixth-place finishes in the English [[Premier League]] and guided them to the [[2010 Football League Cup Final]].\n\nHe became [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] manager in 2013 and led them to qualification for the [[2016 UEFA European Championship]] for the third time in the nation's history, beating the reigning world champions, Germany in the process.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/republic-of-ireland-qualify-for-euro-2016-a3115841.html|title=Republic of Ireland qualify for Euro 2016|last=Spellman|first=Damian|date=16 November 2015|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=8 April 2017}}</ref> He left the role with [[assistant manager|assistant]] Roy Keane by \"mutual agreement\" in November 2018.<ref name=\"RTE mutual\">{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/1121/1012347-martin-oneill-and-roy-keane-part-company-with-fai/|title=Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane leave Ireland jobs by mutual agreement|date=21 November 2018|accessdate=21 November 2018|publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and Gaelic football career==\nO'Neill was born in [[Kilrea]],<ref name=\"rt\u00e9 interview\">Said by O'Neill during lecture on theme of \"[http://www.thescore.ie/martin-oneill-irish-identity-1089500-Nov2013/ What it means to be Irish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114244/http://www.thescore.ie/martin-oneill-irish-identity-1089500-Nov2013/ |date=26 August 2014 }}\", part of the [http://www.rte.ie/radio1/presidential/ Ireland Of Tomorrow \u2013 A Presidential Lecture Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118030838/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/presidential/ |date=18 January 2009 }} (first broadcast on RT\u00c9 Radio on 31 December 2008)</ref> [[County Londonderry]], Northern Ireland in 1952.
