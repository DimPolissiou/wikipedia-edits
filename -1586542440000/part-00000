The license streams from the patents on these inventions, and related products, are a major component of Qualcomm's business.\n\nIn June 2011, Qualcomm announced that it would release a set of [[application programming interface]]s geared to give Web-based applications deeper links into hardware.<ref>Rick Merritt, EE Times. \"[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216583/Qualcomm-extends-support-for-Web-apps Qualcomm will give Web apps a boost ].\" June 3, 2011. Retrieved June 3, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Satellite phone network==\n{{main|Globalstar}}\nBeginning in 1991, Qualcomm participated in the development of the [[Globalstar]] satellite system along with [[Loral Space & Communications]]. It uses a low Earth orbit (LEO) [[satellite constellation]] consisting of 44 active satellites. The system is used for voice telephony via hand-held [[satellite phone]]s, asset tracking and data transfer using mobile [[satellite modem]]s. The system was designed as a normal IS-95 system, and used the satellite as a \"bent pipe\" or \"repeater\" to transfer cellular signals from the handset to the terrestrial base station.  Unlike the Iridium system, which routes phone calls between satellites, the Globalstar satellite must always be able to see both the handset and the base station to establish a connection, therefore, there is no coverage over the Earth's poles where there are no satellite orbits. There is also no coverage in locations where the large Globalstar base stations are not in view (some locations in the South Atlantic, for example.) Some of the Globalstar hardware is manufactured by Qualcomm. Like other satellite phone networks Globalstar went bankrupt in 1999, only to be bought up by a group of investors who are currently running the system.\n\n==Legal issues==\n===With Apple Inc.===\nIn January 2017, Apple announced a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm for overcharging chips and failing to pay $1 billion in rebates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-lawsuit-qualcomm-idUSKBN1542SG|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=21 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=Anita|title=Qualcomm blasts 'baseless' $1 billion Apple royalties lawsuit|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/20/apple-sues-qualcomm-for-1-billion.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=CNBC|date=21 January 2017}}</ref> Qualcomm however rejected the accusations, calling the claims \"baseless\".<ref>{{cite news|title=BRIEF-Qualcomm terms Apple's claims on lawsuit \"baseless\"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN1FA0TL|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=21 January 2017}}</ref> A week before the Apple lawsuit, Qualcomm shares dropped as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] accused the company of demanding excessive royalties for technologies that are \"essential to industry standards.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Qualcomm shares plunge amid US antitrust case|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/17/qualcomm-shares-plunge-after-report-said-it-will-face-us-antitrust-case.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=CNBC|date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Qualcomm was sued by a group of shareholders in the wake of the aforementioned FTC ruling and Apple lawsuit.<ref name=\"Law360\">{{cite news|title=Qualcomm Hit With Shareholder Suit Over FTC, Apple Claims|url=https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/884330/qualcomm-hit-with-shareholder-suit-over-ftc-apple-claims|publisher=Law360}}</ref> On January 4, 2019, the FTC trial began before Judge [[Lucy Koh]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/04/qualcomm-ftc-antitrust-trial-begins/|title=Qualcomm Facing Off With FTC in Antitrust Trial That Kicks Off Today|last=Clover|first=Juli|website=www.macrumors.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nOn January 24, 2018, the European Commission announced a \u20ac997 million fine ($1.2 billion, 4.9% of 2017 turnover) against Qualcomm for violating antitrust laws, by means of its deals with Apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/043c6bfe-0106-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5|title=EU hits Qualcomm with \u20ac997m fine for abusing its dominance|publisher=Financial Times|url-access=subscription |accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/reuters-america-update-1-eu-fines-qualcomm-1-point-2-bln-over-apple-chip-deals.html|title=UPDATE 1-EU fines Qualcomm $1.2 bln over Apple chip deals|last=CNBC|date=2018-01-24|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2019, Apple's COO [[Jeff Williams (Apple)|Jeff Williams]] said that Apple wanted to use Qualcomm modems in the [[iPhone XS]] and [[IPhone XR|XR]] but Qualcomm refused to sell them after Apple sued over its licensing practices, leading to Apple using [[Intel]]'s modems instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182441/apple-qualcomm-modem-iphone-xs-max-ftc-trial|title=Apple says Qualcomm refused to sell it chips for the latest iPhones|last=Liao|first=Shannon|date=2019-01-14|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 2019, just as opening arguments had begun in the suit, the two companies settled.

As of 2017, Qualcomm is among the top-five semiconductor firms, after Micron Technology, SK Hynix, Intel, and Samsung Electronics.<ref name=\"gartner\">{{cite news|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Semiconductor Revenue Grew 22.2 Percent in 2017; Samsung Takes Over No. 1 Position|url=https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3842666|publisher=Gartner|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> Following Qualcomm's acquisition of [[CSR (company)|CSR]] in 2015, Qualcomm also designs various low power [[System on a chip|SoCs]] under the CSR, QCA and QCC brands.\n* '''[[Qualcomm VR 820]] VR headset''' \u2013 anticipated in '''Q4 2016''':\n**custom-designed 64-bit Qualcomm [[Kryo (microarchitecture)|Kryo]] quad-core CPU\n**Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU\n**'''1440\u00d71440''' resolution per eye\n**AMOLED panel that supports up to 70&nbsp;Hz\n* '''Server processors''' \u2013 In 2015 Qualcomm announced that it was going to enter the enterprise server market, with its Centriq chipsets based on the Falkor CPU. Development began in early 2016, with availability slated for the same year.\n* '''Tracking devices''' \u2013 OmniTRACS is a two-way satellite communications and geolocation [[trailer tracking]] technology designed for the over-the-road transport market. As of April 2012, approximately 1.5 million units have been shipped to businesses in 39 countries on 4 continents.\n* '''Satellite phones''' \u2013 Qualcomm manufactures some of the handsets used on the [[Globalstar]] network.\n* '''MediaFLO''' \u2013 Qualcomm is the inventor of the [[MediaFLO]] system, based upon OFDM, which transmits 12-15 television channels within 6&nbsp;MHz of spectrum.  Qualcomm has standardized the lower layers of this design in [[Telecommunications Industry Association|TIA]], and manufactures chips and software to add this television capability to cellphones.\n* '''QChat''' \u2013 [[QChat]] is a cellular/data 2-way [[push-to-talk]] voice communications program. Nextel's original push-to-talk technology operates on the iDen network, but Qualcomm's Qchat push-to-talk operates on the [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] Revision A (EV-DO Rev. A) mobile broadband network. Sprint-Nextel's first Qchat phones were released in June 2008. Both iDen and Qchat handsets are sold under the Nextel brand.  On November 29, 2009, Sprint issued a statement to PhoneNews.com that there are no new QChat handsets on the product development roadmap, but it will continue supporting its existing QChat subscribers.\n* '''Qualcomm Gobi/Snapdragon X-Series''' \u2013 [[Qualcomm Gobi]] is a mobile broadband chipset used mainly for cellular data networking and it is also now used in a few enterprise smart phones (e.g. Motorola ES400). It currently is a [[3G]] technology capable up to [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] on [[GSM]] and EV-DO Rev. An on [[CDMA]] carriers. The Gobi chipset is a microprocessor that can load a specific carrier image so that the device appears to be specifically designed for that carrier's network. Since GSM and CDMA are quite different, and since Gobi devices can switch between them both using the same silicon, their solution is considered to be innovative. Gobi Technology is best suited for large enterprise customers where a single mobile operator cannot serve all of their wireless modem needs since there is not one carrier that provides the same level of service in all the places they need that service. The Gobi solution allows the IT department to roll out a single module on their laptop builds which can be configured to behave exactly like a device that is locked to the carrier that they want to use in that area. In the United States exactly the same hardware can be used on the [[CDMA]] network or the GSM network of their choice. For GSM users that travel out of the United States the Gobi solution can be used to avoid international roaming charges by switching the SIM and the device's carrier image to a local provider instead of incurring the roaming charges. In both scenarios the customer must have different wireless accounts with each provider they wish to use natively. It typically takes 20 seconds for the device to load the carrier image into NVRAM and reset and come back online. Gobi 3000 is the next hardware revision of the Gobi platform and it natively supports [[HSPA+]]. The model for Gobi 3000 is different. It is a reference design the OEMs can license and produce their own Gobi 3000 compliant modules with their own extensions. Qualcomm does not sell any Gobi 3000 silicon. The reference design allows the same boilerplate hardware and software components for the basis of OEM chips which allow the OEMs to focus on innovations on the mobile broadband platform rather than getting bogged down with low-level RF implementations. Currently, Gobi platforms supported LTE natively. Qualcomm re-branded its Gobi modem products under the [[Qualcomm Snapdragon|Snapdragon]] [[Qualcomm Snapdragon LTE modem|X-series]] branding in December 2014.\n* '''Mirasol displays''' \u2013 [[Interferometric modulator display|Mirasol displays]] are the world's first and only reflective, bistable display based on [[Interferometric modulator display|IMOD]] technology. Qualcomm's mirasol displays use ambient light as their source of illumination and consume almost no power when the image is unchanged.  This results in a very low power display solution that is visible even in direct sunlight.\n* '''HALO''' \u2013 A standard for [[Inductive charging|wirelessly charging]] vehicles with relatively high efficiency<ref>{{cite web |last=Hill |first=Jim |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/24/qualcomm-halo |title=Qualcomm Halo: wireless charging for your EV goes live (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=November 19, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116151130/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/24/qualcomm-halo |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> using [[resonant inductive coupling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michelinchallengebibendum.com/en/NEWS-AND-PUBLICATIONS/News/Renault-Qualcomm-Join-Forces-for-Wireless-EV-Charging |title=Challenge Bibendum \u2013 Renault, Qualcomm Join Forces for Wireless EV Charging |publisher=Michelinchallengebibendum.com |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref> created from more than 10 years of research at [[Auckland University]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Czyzewski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/analysis/europes-biggest-wireless-charging-trial-begins-in-london/1012047.article |title=Europe's biggest wireless charging trial begins in London &#124; In-depth |publisher=The Engineer |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/for/the-media/our-research-1/template/subsite_news_item.jsp?cid=464941 |title=Our research stories \u2013 The University of Auckland |publisher=Auckland.ac.nz |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/11/haloipt-2011108.html |title=Qualcomm acquires HaloIPT team and its wireless charging technology |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=November 8, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Software===\n* '''Operating system''' \u2013 BREW ([[Qualcomm Brew|Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless]]) is a proprietary cell phone application platform.

Prior to the existence of cellular and personal communications services networks, this type of communication was limited to private [[Land Mobile Radio System]] (LMR) technology used by public safety and utility service agencies.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} LMR has limitations, specifically its usage can be restricted by geographic coverage area and by use of disparate frequency bands.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nQChat, an application developed for the BREW platform, is a PTT communication technology for 3G networks. QChat handsets and server software allow users to connect instantaneously with other QChat users anywhere in the world with the push of a button. In addition, QChat enables one-to-one (private) and one-to-many (group) calls over the 3G networks.<ref name=\"qualcomm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.qualcomm.com/products_services/mobile_content_services/voice/qchat.html|title=QChat \u2013 Qualcomm|date=March 12, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nQChat uses standard [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) technologies. VoIP is a voice delivery mechanism that uses the Internet Protocol to manage the delivery of voice information. Voice information is sent in digital form over IP-based data networks (including [[CDMA]]) in discrete packets rather than traditional circuit-switched protocols such those used in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).\n\n====Functionality====\nQChat users on [[3G]] wireless devices can connect to each other worldwide, in either private or group calls, with the push of a button. QChat uses [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) technologies to allow subscribers to communicate by using a PTT button on the handset instead of making a standard cellular call.\n\nQChat calls are created by combining separate point-to-point connections between each IP endpoint; the process is managed by the QChat Applications Server, which is deployed on the carrier's IP-based [[Wide Area Network]] (WAN).\n\nTo initiate a call, a user presses the PTT button and receives an immediate indication of whether the call recipient is available. If he or she is, the caller can begin speaking immediately. If the recipient is unavailable, the caller will simply hear a negative response tone instead of a busy signal or voicemail.<ref name=\"qualcomm.com\"/>\n\n====Sprint agreement====\nOn October 16, 2006, [[Sprint Nextel]] announced an agreement with Qualcomm to use QChat to provide high performance push-to-talk services to its customers on the Nationwide Sprint PCS Network, using CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Revision A technology.\n\nQChat is able to inter-operate with iDEN push-to-talk handsets on the Nextel National Network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=1035564&highlight=|title=Sprint Nextel Teams With QUALCOMM and Lucent Technologies to Extend Industry-Leading Push-To-Talk Services with QUALCOMM'S QChat Solution|type=Press release|date=October 16, 2006|access-date=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622225037/http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149|archive-date=June 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSprint's phones supporting QChat technology were released starting in April 2008, with a trial of business customers in Kansas and Colorado.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://urgentcomm.com/mobile-voice-mag/sprint-debuts-qchat-service-devices|title=Sprint debuts Qchat service, devices|last=Luna|first=Lynnette|date=2008-05-01|website=Urgent Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Sprint then announced that the Nextel Direct Connect devices powered by QChat were available in more than 40 markets in June 2008 before ending production of new QChat devices in November 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/sprint-drops-qualcomm-s-qchat|title=Sprint drops Qualcomm's QChat|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fiercewireless.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-08-01}}</ref>\n\nSupported models included:<ref name=\"newsreleases.sprint.com\">{{cite web|url=http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149&p=irol-newsArticle_newsroom&ID=1165293&highlight=Nextel%20Direct%20Connect|title=Sprint Customers in 40+ Markets Can Soon Get Nextel Direct Connect(R) Plus Sprint Mobile Broadband on 4 New Phones|type=Press release|date=June 12, 2008|access-date=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622225037/http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149|archive-date=June 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Sanyo]] Pro 200 (Discontinued)\n* [[Sanyo]] Pro 700 (Discontinued)\n* [[LG]] LX400 (Discontinued)\n* [[Motorola]] V950 (Discontinued)\n* [[Samsung]] Z400 (Discontinued)\n* [[Samsung]] Z700 (Discontinued)\n\n==QuadRooter security issues==\nIn August 2016, the computer security company [[Check Point]] found several serious security problems on Qualcomm chips.<ref name=\"checkpoint\">{{cite web|title=New Android Vulnerabilities in Over 900 Million Devices|url=http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/08/07/quadrooter/|website=Checkpoint Blog|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> The bug called Quadrooter has the ability to let hackers read all information on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones.

variant known as [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] and its evolutions; and [[TDSCDMA|TD-SCDMA]]; as well as patents on 4G. The license streams from the patents on these inventions, and related products, are a major component of Qualcomm's business.\n\nIn June 2011, Qualcomm announced that it would release a set of [[application programming interface]]s geared to give Web-based applications deeper links into hardware.<ref>Rick Merritt, EE Times. \"[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4216583/Qualcomm-extends-support-for-Web-apps Qualcomm will give Web apps a boost ].\" June 3, 2011. Retrieved June 3, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Satellite phone network==\n{{main|Globalstar}}\nBeginning in 1991, Qualcomm participated in the development of the [[Globalstar]] satellite system along with [[Loral Space & Communications]]. It uses a low Earth orbit (LEO) [[satellite constellation]] consisting of 44 active satellites. The system is used for voice telephony via hand-held [[satellite phone]]s, asset tracking and data transfer using mobile [[satellite modem]]s. The system was designed as a normal IS-95 system, and used the satellite as a \"bent pipe\" or \"repeater\" to transfer cellular signals from the handset to the terrestrial base station.  Unlike the Iridium system, which routes phone calls between satellites, the Globalstar satellite must always be able to see both the handset and the base station to establish a connection, therefore, there is no coverage over the Earth's poles where there are no satellite orbits. There is also no coverage in locations where the large Globalstar base stations are not in view (some locations in the South Atlantic, for example.) Some of the Globalstar hardware is manufactured by Qualcomm. Like other satellite phone networks Globalstar went bankrupt in 1999, only to be bought up by a group of investors who are currently running the system.\n\n==Legal issues==\n===With Apple Inc.===\nIn January 2017, Apple announced a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm for overcharging chips and failing to pay $1 billion in rebates.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-lawsuit-qualcomm-idUSKBN1542SG|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=21 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=Anita|title=Qualcomm blasts 'baseless' $1 billion Apple royalties lawsuit|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/20/apple-sues-qualcomm-for-1-billion.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=CNBC|date=21 January 2017}}</ref> Qualcomm however rejected the accusations, calling the claims \"baseless\".<ref>{{cite news|title=BRIEF-Qualcomm terms Apple's claims on lawsuit \"baseless\"|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN1FA0TL|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=21 January 2017}}</ref> A week before the Apple lawsuit, Qualcomm shares dropped as the [[Federal Trade Commission]] accused the company of demanding excessive royalties for technologies that are \"essential to industry standards.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Qualcomm shares plunge amid US antitrust case|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/17/qualcomm-shares-plunge-after-report-said-it-will-face-us-antitrust-case.html|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=CNBC|date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Qualcomm was sued by a group of shareholders in the wake of the aforementioned FTC ruling and Apple lawsuit.<ref name=\"Law360\">{{cite news|title=Qualcomm Hit With Shareholder Suit Over FTC, Apple Claims|url=https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/884330/qualcomm-hit-with-shareholder-suit-over-ftc-apple-claims|publisher=Law360}}</ref> On January 4, 2019, the FTC trial began before Judge [[Lucy Koh]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/04/qualcomm-ftc-antitrust-trial-begins/|title=Qualcomm Facing Off With FTC in Antitrust Trial That Kicks Off Today|last=Clover|first=Juli|website=www.macrumors.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nOn January 24, 2018, the European Commission announced a \u20ac997 million fine ($1.2 billion, 4.9% of 2017 turnover) against Qualcomm for violating antitrust laws, by means of its deals with Apple.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/043c6bfe-0106-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5|title=EU hits Qualcomm with \u20ac997m fine for abusing its dominance|publisher=Financial Times|url-access=subscription |accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/reuters-america-update-1-eu-fines-qualcomm-1-point-2-bln-over-apple-chip-deals.html|title=UPDATE 1-EU fines Qualcomm $1.2 bln over Apple chip deals|last=CNBC|date=2018-01-24|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2019, Apple's COO [[Jeff Williams (Apple)|Jeff Williams]] said that Apple wanted to use Qualcomm modems in the [[iPhone XS]] and [[IPhone XR|XR]] but Qualcomm refused to sell them after Apple sued over its licensing practices, leading to Apple using [[Intel]]'s modems instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182441/apple-qualcomm-modem-iphone-xs-max-ftc-trial|title=Apple says Qualcomm refused to sell it chips for the latest iPhones|last=Liao|first=Shannon|date=2019-01-14|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 2019, just as opening arguments had begun in the suit, the two companies settled.

At issue is software designed to extend battery life in chips while users make out-of-network calls. In October, an ITC administrative judge made an initial ruling that Qualcomm violated the Broadcom patent covering that feature and the commission later affirmed the decision. Sprint Nextel Corp. is using a software patch from Qualcomm to get around a U.S. government agency ban on new phones with Qualcomm chips.\nIn August 2007, Judge Rudi Brewster held that Qualcomm had engaged in litigation misconduct by withholding relevant documents during the lawsuit it brought against Broadcom and that Qualcomm employees had lied about their involvement.<ref name=\"six\">[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/08/08/judge-brewster-benchslaps-qualcomm-lawyers/ Judge Brewster Benchslaps Qualcomm Lawyers], ''[[Wall Street Journal]] Law Blog'', August 8, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/08/AR2008010803906.html?noredirect=on] \"Qualcomm Lawyers Reprimanded in Broadcom Case\" PC World Tuesday, January 8, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, South Korea's antitrust watchdog fined Qualcomm a record Won260bn ($207m) for \"unfair\" business practices related to its chipset sales, sparking strong protests from the company.

Qualcomm has standardized the lower layers of this design in [[Telecommunications Industry Association|TIA]], and manufactures chips and software to add this television capability to cellphones.\n* '''QChat''' \u2013 [[QChat]] is a cellular/data 2-way [[push-to-talk]] voice communications program. Nextel's original push-to-talk technology operates on the iDen network, but Qualcomm's Qchat push-to-talk operates on the [[Evolution-Data Optimized]] Revision A (EV-DO Rev. A) mobile broadband network. Sprint-Nextel's first Qchat phones were released in June 2008. Both iDen and Qchat handsets are sold under the Nextel brand.  On November 29, 2009, Sprint issued a statement to PhoneNews.com that there are no new QChat handsets on the product development roadmap, but it will continue supporting its existing QChat subscribers.\n* '''Qualcomm Gobi/Snapdragon X-Series''' \u2013 [[Qualcomm Gobi]] is a mobile broadband chipset used mainly for cellular data networking and it is also now used in a few enterprise smart phones (e.g. Motorola ES400). It currently is a [[3G]] technology capable up to [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] on [[GSM]] and EV-DO Rev. An on [[CDMA]] carriers. The Gobi chipset is a microprocessor that can load a specific carrier image so that the device appears to be specifically designed for that carrier's network. Since GSM and CDMA are quite different, and since Gobi devices can switch between them both using the same silicon, their solution is considered to be innovative. Gobi Technology is best suited for large enterprise customers where a single mobile operator cannot serve all of their wireless modem needs since there is not one carrier that provides the same level of service in all the places they need that service. The Gobi solution allows the IT department to roll out a single module on their laptop builds which can be configured to behave exactly like a device that is locked to the carrier that they want to use in that area. In the United States exactly the same hardware can be used on the [[CDMA]] network or the GSM network of their choice. For GSM users that travel out of the United States the Gobi solution can be used to avoid international roaming charges by switching the SIM and the device's carrier image to a local provider instead of incurring the roaming charges. In both scenarios the customer must have different wireless accounts with each provider they wish to use natively. It typically takes 20 seconds for the device to load the carrier image into NVRAM and reset and come back online. Gobi 3000 is the next hardware revision of the Gobi platform and it natively supports [[HSPA+]]. The model for Gobi 3000 is different. It is a reference design the OEMs can license and produce their own Gobi 3000 compliant modules with their own extensions. Qualcomm does not sell any Gobi 3000 silicon. The reference design allows the same boilerplate hardware and software components for the basis of OEM chips which allow the OEMs to focus on innovations on the mobile broadband platform rather than getting bogged down with low-level RF implementations. Currently, Gobi platforms supported LTE natively. Qualcomm re-branded its Gobi modem products under the [[Qualcomm Snapdragon|Snapdragon]] [[Qualcomm Snapdragon LTE modem|X-series]] branding in December 2014.\n* '''Mirasol displays''' \u2013 [[Interferometric modulator display|Mirasol displays]] are the world's first and only reflective, bistable display based on [[Interferometric modulator display|IMOD]] technology. Qualcomm's mirasol displays use ambient light as their source of illumination and consume almost no power when the image is unchanged.  This results in a very low power display solution that is visible even in direct sunlight.\n* '''HALO''' \u2013 A standard for [[Inductive charging|wirelessly charging]] vehicles with relatively high efficiency<ref>{{cite web |last=Hill |first=Jim |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/24/qualcomm-halo |title=Qualcomm Halo: wireless charging for your EV goes live (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=November 19, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116151130/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/24/qualcomm-halo |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> using [[resonant inductive coupling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michelinchallengebibendum.com/en/NEWS-AND-PUBLICATIONS/News/Renault-Qualcomm-Join-Forces-for-Wireless-EV-Charging |title=Challenge Bibendum \u2013 Renault, Qualcomm Join Forces for Wireless EV Charging |publisher=Michelinchallengebibendum.com |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref> created from more than 10 years of research at [[Auckland University]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Czyzewski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/analysis/europes-biggest-wireless-charging-trial-begins-in-london/1012047.article |title=Europe's biggest wireless charging trial begins in London &#124; In-depth |publisher=The Engineer |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/for/the-media/our-research-1/template/subsite_news_item.jsp?cid=464941 |title=Our research stories \u2013 The University of Auckland |publisher=Auckland.ac.nz |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/11/haloipt-2011108.html |title=Qualcomm acquires HaloIPT team and its wireless charging technology |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=November 8, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Software===\n* '''Operating system''' \u2013 BREW ([[Qualcomm Brew|Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless]]) is a proprietary cell phone application platform.

VoIP is a voice delivery mechanism that uses the Internet Protocol to manage the delivery of voice information. Voice information is sent in digital form over IP-based data networks (including [[CDMA]]) in discrete packets rather than traditional circuit-switched protocols such those used in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).\n\n====Functionality====\nQChat users on [[3G]] wireless devices can connect to each other worldwide, in either private or group calls, with the push of a button. QChat uses [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) technologies to allow subscribers to communicate by using a PTT button on the handset instead of making a standard cellular call.\n\nQChat calls are created by combining separate point-to-point connections between each IP endpoint; the process is managed by the QChat Applications Server, which is deployed on the carrier's IP-based [[Wide Area Network]] (WAN).\n\nTo initiate a call, a user presses the PTT button and receives an immediate indication of whether the call recipient is available. If he or she is, the caller can begin speaking immediately. If the recipient is unavailable, the caller will simply hear a negative response tone instead of a busy signal or voicemail.<ref name=\"qualcomm.com\"/>\n\n====Sprint agreement====\nOn October 16, 2006, [[Sprint Nextel]] announced an agreement with Qualcomm to use QChat to provide high performance push-to-talk services to its customers on the Nationwide Sprint PCS Network, using CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Revision A technology.\n\nQChat is able to inter-operate with iDEN push-to-talk handsets on the Nextel National Network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=1035564&highlight=|title=Sprint Nextel Teams With QUALCOMM and Lucent Technologies to Extend Industry-Leading Push-To-Talk Services with QUALCOMM'S QChat Solution|type=Press release|date=October 16, 2006|access-date=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622225037/http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149|archive-date=June 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSprint's phones supporting QChat technology were released starting in April 2008, with a trial of business customers in Kansas and Colorado.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://urgentcomm.com/mobile-voice-mag/sprint-debuts-qchat-service-devices|title=Sprint debuts Qchat service, devices|last=Luna|first=Lynnette|date=2008-05-01|website=Urgent Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Sprint then announced that the Nextel Direct Connect devices powered by QChat were available in more than 40 markets in June 2008 before ending production of new QChat devices in November 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/sprint-drops-qualcomm-s-qchat|title=Sprint drops Qualcomm's QChat|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fiercewireless.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-08-01}}</ref>\n\nSupported models included:<ref name=\"newsreleases.sprint.com\">{{cite web|url=http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149&p=irol-newsArticle_newsroom&ID=1165293&highlight=Nextel%20Direct%20Connect|title=Sprint Customers in 40+ Markets Can Soon Get Nextel Direct Connect(R) Plus Sprint Mobile Broadband on 4 New Phones|type=Press release|date=June 12, 2008|access-date=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622225037/http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149|archive-date=June 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Sanyo]] Pro 200 (Discontinued)\n* [[Sanyo]] Pro 700 (Discontinued)\n* [[LG]] LX400 (Discontinued)\n* [[Motorola]] V950 (Discontinued)\n* [[Samsung]] Z400 (Discontinued)\n* [[Samsung]] Z700 (Discontinued)\n\n==QuadRooter security issues==\nIn August 2016, the computer security company [[Check Point]] found several serious security problems on Qualcomm chips.<ref name=\"checkpoint\">{{cite web|title=New Android Vulnerabilities in Over 900 Million Devices|url=http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/08/07/quadrooter/|website=Checkpoint Blog|accessdate=August 12, 2016}}</ref> The bug called Quadrooter has the ability to let hackers read all information on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

Alice began writing at Collinwood High School in Cleveland, under the tutelage of Sylvia Cochrane. She was the editor of a literary page in the school's paper,''The Collinwood Spotlight'', for which she wrote short stories. During this time, she wrote her first book, ''Ralestone Luck'', which was eventually published as her second novel in 1938.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1930, Norton planned to become a teacher, and began studying at Flora Stone Mather College of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]]. However, in 1932 she had to leave because of the Depression, and began working for the [[Cleveland Public Library|Cleveland Library System]],<ref name=\"Mclellan\" /> where she remained for 18 years, latterly in the children's section of the Nottingham Branch Library in Cleveland. In 1934, she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton, a pen name she had adopted for her first book, published later that year, to increase her marketability, since boys were the main audience for fantasy.<ref name=\"Mclellan\" />\n\nDuring 1940\u20131941, she worked as a special librarian in the cataloging department of the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>Bankston, John.

Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the two abalone shells, and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the toolkits. Evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources (implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow), possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone, using a probable recipe to produce the compound, and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use.<ref name=\"bbc.com-15257259\">{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Amos |title=A Cultural Leap at the Dawn of Humanity - Ancient 'paint factory' unearthed |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-15257259 |date=13 October 2011 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=13 October 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Washington Post-2011/10/12/gIQApyHrhL\">{{cite news |last=Vastag |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Vastag |title=South African cave yields paint from dawn of humanity |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/african-cave-yields-paint-from-dawn-of-humanity/2011/10/12/gIQApyHrhL_story.html |date=13 October 2011 |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 October 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Henshilwood et al. 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = Christopher S. | display-authors = etal | year = 2011 | title = A 100,000-Year-Old Ochre-Processing Workshop at Blombos Cave, South Africa | url = | journal = Science | volume = 334 | issue = | pages = 219\u2013222 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211535 | pmid = 21998386 }}</ref> Modern behaviors, such as the making of shell beads, bone tools and arrows, and the use of ochre pigment, are evident at a Kenyan site by 78,000-67,000 years ago.<ref>Shipton C, d'Errico F, Petraglia M, et al.

However it may also be that the pace of advance always looks relatively faster to humans in the time they live, because previous advances are unrecognised 'givens'.<ref>https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/human-advancement-why-has-so-much-of-our-progress-come-so-recently.html</ref><ref>https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328571-400-puzzles-of-evolution-why-was-technological-development-so-slow/</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Who We Are And How We Got Here - Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |first=David |last=Reich |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |year=2018 |isbn=978-1101870327 }}<ref name=\"NYT-20180420\">{{cite news |last=Diamond |first=Jared |title=A Brand-New Version of Our Origin Story |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/books/review/david-reich-who-we-are-how-we-got-here.html |date=April 20, 2018 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 23, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Homo sapiens|''Homo sapiens''}}\n{{wikispecies|Homo sapiens}}\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016).\n\n{{Human Evolution|state=collapsed}}\n{{Big History}}\n{{portal bar|Evolutionary biology}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q15978631}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Humans|*]]\n[[Category:Anatomically modern humans| ]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Tool-using mammals]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: 4 million \u2192 4\u00a0million (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens"}
