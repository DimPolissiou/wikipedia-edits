One study is looking at whether existing HIV drugs including [[Lopinavir]] and [[Ritonavir]] could be used with results available in three months. Another study led by Dr Kenneth Baillie of Edinburgh University looks at the genetics of patients susceptible to severe illness by comparing patients' DNA with that of healthy people who show no or mild symptoms.\n\n[[Dundee University]] is to lead a trial into [[brensocatib]] (formerly known as INS1007) a drug for [[lung inflammation]] ([[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]) to treat the worst symptoms of coronavirus and prevent the need for ventilation. Up to 20% of Covid-19 patients develop lung inflammation which can require them to be ventilated. The inflammatory response to the virus causes lung damage that can lead to respiratory failure and death in severe cases. It is hoped the treatment will also lead to patients spending fewer days dependent on oxygen and shorter periods of time in hospital, reducing the burden on healthcare systems. Funding and drug supply for the STOP-COVID19 (Superiority Trial of Protease Inhibition in Covid-19) trial is being provided by biopharmaceutical company Insmed Incorporated. The trial is to start in May and researchers plan to recruit 300 volunteers from 10 hospitals. Half of the group will receive brensocatib while the other half will be given a placebo. The project is led by James Chalmers, professor of respiratory research at Dundee University and consultant respiratory physician at [[Ninewells Hospital]], one of the trial sites.

One study is looking at whether existing HIV drugs including [[Lopinavir]] and [[Ritonavir]] could be used with results available in three months. Another study led by Dr Kenneth Baillie of Edinburgh University looks at the genetics of patients susceptible to severe illness by comparing patients' DNA with that of healthy people who show no or mild symptoms.\n\n[[Dundee University]] is to lead a trial into [[brensocatib]] (formerly known as INS1007) a drug for [[lung inflammation]] ([[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]) to treat the worst symptoms of coronavirus and prevent the need for ventilation. Up to 20% of Covid-19 patients develop lung inflammation which can require them to be ventilated. The inflammatory response to the virus causes lung damage that can lead to respiratory failure and death in severe cases. It is hoped the treatment will also lead to patients spending fewer days dependent on oxygen and shorter periods of time in hospital, reducing the burden on healthcare systems. Funding and drug supply for the STOP-COVID19 (Superiority Trial of Protease Inhibition in Covid-19) trial is being provided by biopharmaceutical company Insmed Incorporated. The trial is to start in May and researchers plan to recruit 300 volunteers from 10 hospitals. Half of the group will receive brensocatib while the other half will be given a placebo. The project is led by James Chalmers, professor of respiratory research at Dundee University and consultant respiratory physician at [[Ninewells Hospital]], one of the trial sites.

He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R. Chopra]] over the production of the series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' based on [[Mahabharata|another epic of the same name]], and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=S.

K. Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nThe series was re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one show in morning and one show in night during the [[2020 coronavirus lockdown in India|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with.

Another theory, however, suggests that the name was derived from \"naga-batu\" (fighting or opposing) which is used to describe a creek in the town that flowed from east to west opposite to that of the usual flows of the rivers in the region.<ref name=\"cabatuan.gov.ph\">The Official Webpage of the Municipality of Cabatuan - http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=41{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe town of Cabatuan was first noted for the \"Sinulugans\" or hillside tribesmen who annually practice the art of \u201cSinulog\u201d or Dance of Death characterized by sword fighting rituals. \"Tulisanes\" and Rustlers also inhabit the place before the Spaniards came in 1732.<ref name=\"freewebs.com\">Cabatuan Roman Catholic Church (History of Cabatuan) - http://www.freewebs.com/cabatuanchurch/cabatuanchurch.htm</ref>\n\nThe town was founded on April 9, 1732 after a molave cross (with only its base currently existing) was planted on the peak of Pamul-ogan Hill. It was originally planned by Tono whose statue now stands in front of the Municipal Building. He was then a town leader together with two other leaders Gomoc and Amihan.  This early settlement was then flourishing on a level zone of land near the northern bank of the Tigum River where the ''poblacion'' or the commercial center of the town is now located.<ref name=\"cabatuan.gov.ph\" />\n\nIn 1733, Cabatuan was officially organized upon the installation of Rev. Fr. Antonio Lopez as its first priest and Tono as its first \u201cgobernadorcillo\u201d. Furthermore, the town was placed by the priest under the spiritual protection of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|Saint Nicholas de Tolentino]] whom Cabatuananons venerate as their Patron Saint whose feast is celebrated from September 1\u201310 every year through a 10-day celebration that is grandiosely culminated on September 10 by the highly anticipated ''Tinuom Festival'' patterned from Iloilo's [[Dinagyang|Kasadyahan Festival]].<ref name=\"cabatuan.gov.ph\" />\n\nIn 1903, after the census had been taken, the neighbouring town of [[Maasin, Iloilo|Maasin]], with a population of 8401, was temporarily annexed to Cabatuan that had a population of 16,497.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Cabatuan officially became the last defense of Western Visayas against the Japanese forces which led to the destruction of most of its edifices.<ref name=\"freewebs.com\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Cabatuan\n| 1903 = 16497\n| 1918 = 14816\n| 1939 = 21054\n| 1948 = 24743\n| 1960 = 26397\n| 1970 = 30078\n| 1975 = 32268\n| 1980 = 34468\n| 1990 = 40892\t\t\n| 1995 = 42264\n| 2000 = 45935\n| 2007 = 50861\n| 2010 = 54950\n| 2015 = 58442\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabatuan, Iloilo, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n[[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]] is the most dominant language used by the residents but [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[English language|English]], and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] are also spoken.

The gigantic Church is the only existing church in Iloilo which has three fa\u00e7ades. Its twin belfries capped with cream-colored domes are considered to be one of the best in the Philippines.\n\nThe church was given the title \"Model of Temples\" since it was the best representation of European architecture on the Philippine islands during the Spanish era. In 1948, the church was partially damaged by an earthquake which ruined four of its belfries, two of its fa\u00e7ade pediments and the central dome. In the early 1990s the church was restored back to its present grandeur. Today, 'La Iglesia de San Nicolas de Tolentino' is one of the most picturesque churches in Asia.\n\n===Cabatuan Cemetery===\nThis century old Spanish-Filipino Cemetery is the only cemetery in the Philippines which is a perfect square. Three Byzantine arch entrances dominate the front-gate, while a baroque central chapel is located at the center. The chapel is a fusion of Roman, Gothic, Byzantine, and Baroque architectures. The complex carvings on the chapel's facade is considered to be the most distinct cemetery relief which can only be found in Cabatuan. Furthermore, this cemetery's neatness and organization is famous throughout the region.\n\n===The Town Hall===\nOne of the earliest town halls built in Northern Iloilo is the Cabatuan Municipal Hall. It was built in 1734 along with the Church. Calamities and war, however, damaged the second level of this public house and many renovations had been done. On the other hand, the designs were still derived from the original plan of the Casa. The first level of the town hall is already centuries old and its interior is characterized by the art deco cubical columns and semi-arched tuscan windows adorned with capiz shells.\n\n===Pamul-ogan Hill===\nThis shrine is considered to be the cradle of Cabatuan's History. At the peak of the hill lies a concrete cross reminiscent of the original cross planted by the Spaniards who first came in the region. Every lent, traditional devotees start their journey from the mouth of Barangay Pamulogan to the peak of the hill as penitence.\n\n===Baluarte Shrine===\nThis picturesque shrine located in Balic Hill, is one of the places in Cabatuan that attract many tourists and pilgrims during lenten season. On the peak is a cross, a replica of the one in Pamul-ogan Hill, and on the foot of the hill lies an art-deco chapel. The view at the cross offers an astounding view of the whole town.\n\n===The Tree of Bondage===\nThe Shrine of the Bondage Tree lies in the Town plaza directly in front of the Municipal Hall of Cabatuan. It is believed that the natives were tied in this tree and whipped if they refuse the ''polo'' or forced labor during the Spanish Era. The tree is an old and artistically skewed [[Plumeria]] tree (''Plumeria rubra'') currently fortified with a concrete base to withstand destruction.\n\n==Festivals and Events==\nThe town celebrates three main holidays: the Cabatuan Town Fiesta on September 10, as well as the Tinuom Festival that culminates the town fiesta and the strictly observed [[Lent]]en procession during [[Holy Week]].\n\n===Tinuom Festival===\nThe Tinuom Festival is a celebration of the town's history and its popularly craved delicacy, ''[[tinuom]]'' made of native chicken souped with spices - tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and lemon grass and wrapped in banana leaves.<ref>One Town One Product - http://www.otopphilippines.gov.ph/microsite.aspx?rid=7&provid=65&prodid=743 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321181145/http://www.otopphilippines.gov.ph/microsite.aspx?rid=7&provid=65&prodid=743# |date=2009-03-21 }}</ref> This festival is one of the highlights of the 10-day fiesta celebration of the municipality and is a colorful explosion of music and dances patterned from Iloilo's [[Dinagyang|Kasadyahan Festival]].  There are six (6) competing groups (called tribes or \"tribu\" in the local dialect) composed of students from six secondary schools in Cabatuan. The groups are judged according to creativity, originality, costume, and choreography, among others. The winning group is the town's official representative to the Kasadyahan Festival in [[Iloilo City]] where the town has been actively participating in. This year, Tribu Ilahas from Tiring National High School, winner of the 2007 Tinuom Festival placed third in the Kasadayahan Competition.<ref>Official Site of the Municipality of Cabatuan - http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=12&Itemid=14 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911133212/http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=12&Itemid=14# |date=2011-09-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Holy Week===\nCabatuan is also known to have the most wooden and porcelain statues being showcased on Lenten processions (a religious parade evident in almost all parishes in the [[Philippines]] during Holy Week). The most popular set of these figures is the wooden [[Last Supper]].\n\nIn the morning of [[Good Friday]], the statue of the Nazareno together with thousands of Cabatuananons and tourists alike follow a procession locally called ''Via Crucis'' from the Church to the Balic Hill pausing on the 14 Stations of the Cross erected along the path.\n\nIn the afternoon, on the other hand, another procession is held after the Good Friday Mass around the ''poblacion'' where the said wooden and porcelain statues embellished with fresh flowers, royal cloths and personalized lighting are paraded. They pass by the Stations of the Cross creatively displayed along in life-size carvings and effigies locally called ''Kapiya'' built out of indigenous materials native to the barangays assigned to the specific station. This unique display garnered recognition in [[Western Visayas]] and consequently haul tourists as well. ''Pasyon Singing'' by barangay folks accompanying their respective Kapiya follows the procession.<ref name=\"Tourist Attractions\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026213758/http://www.geocities.com/cabatuan_iloilo/Tourism/places.htm Tourist Attractions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nLastly, the ''Dampug'' culminates the Holy Week. It is the reenactment of the angel's proclamation of Christ's resurrection and his meeting with Mary. Every year, a child of an illustrious family in town is held as \u201cDampug\u201d or the proclaiming angel and a flamboyant stage, usually with cavern motif, is erected in the town plaza to serve as backdrop for the early dawn presentation. It is still very much respected by the townspeople today.<ref name=\"Tourist Attractions\" />\n\n==Facilities and services==\n\n===Health Services===\n\n====Rural Health Center====\nLocated at San Agustin Street right behind the plaza's covered courts, the Cabatuan Rural Health Center is the most accessible rural health center in the municipality.

The name might have evolved from (1) Ca''Batuan'' which means a large area of rocks (2) Batuan  which means to fight, defy, or oppose, and (3) [[Garcinia morella|Batu-an]] an sour-fruit-bearing evergreen tree that grew abundantly in the region. Another theory, however, suggests that the name was derived from \"naga-batu\" (fighting or opposing) which is used to describe a creek in the town that flowed from east to west opposite to that of the usual flows of the rivers in the region.<ref name=\"cabatuan.gov.ph\">The Official Webpage of the Municipality of Cabatuan - http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=41{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe town of Cabatuan was first noted for the \"Sinulugans\" or hillside tribesmen who annually practice the art of \u201cSinulog\u201d or Dance of Death characterized by sword fighting rituals. \"Tulisanes\" and Rustlers also inhabit the place before the Spaniards came in 1732.<ref name=\"freewebs.com\">Cabatuan Roman Catholic Church (History of Cabatuan) - http://www.freewebs.com/cabatuanchurch/cabatuanchurch.htm</ref>\n\nThe town was founded on April 9, 1732 after a molave cross (with only its base currently existing) was planted on the peak of Pamul-ogan Hill. It was originally planned by Tono whose statue now stands in front of the Municipal Building. He was then a town leader together with two other leaders Gomoc and Amihan.  This early settlement was then flourishing on a level zone of land near the northern bank of the Tigum River where the ''poblacion'' or the commercial center of the town is now located.<ref name=\"cabatuan.gov.ph\" />\n\nIn 1733, Cabatuan was officially organized upon the installation of Rev. Fr. Antonio Lopez as its first priest and Tono as its first \u201cgobernadorcillo\u201d. Furthermore, the town was placed by the priest under the spiritual protection of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|Saint Nicholas de Tolentino]] whom Cabatuananons venerate as their Patron Saint whose feast is celebrated from September 1\u201310 every year through a 10-day celebration that is grandiosely culminated on September 10 by the highly anticipated ''Tinuom Festival'' patterned from Iloilo's [[Dinagyang|Kasadyahan Festival]].<ref name=\"cabatuan.gov.ph\" />\n\nIn 1903, after the census had been taken, the neighbouring town of [[Maasin, Iloilo|Maasin]], with a population of 8401, was temporarily annexed to Cabatuan that had a population of 16,497.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Cabatuan officially became the last defense of Western Visayas against the Japanese forces which led to the destruction of most of its edifices.<ref name=\"freewebs.com\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Cabatuan\n| 1903 = 16497\n| 1918 = 14816\n| 1939 = 21054\n| 1948 = 24743\n| 1960 = 26397\n| 1970 = 30078\n| 1975 = 32268\n| 1980 = 34468\n| 1990 = 40892\t\t\n| 1995 = 42264\n| 2000 = 45935\n| 2007 = 50861\n| 2010 = 54950\n| 2015 = 58442\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabatuan, Iloilo, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n[[Kinaray-a language|Kinaray-a]] is the most dominant language used by the residents but [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[English language|English]], and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] are also spoken.

The gigantic Church is the only existing church in Iloilo which has three fa\u00e7ades. Its twin belfries capped with cream-colored domes are considered to be one of the best in the Philippines.\n\nThe church was given the title \"Model of Temples\" since it was the best representation of European architecture on the Philippine islands during the Spanish era. In 1948, the church was partially damaged by an earthquake which ruined four of its belfries, two of its fa\u00e7ade pediments and the central dome. In the early 1990s the church was restored back to its present grandeur. Today, 'La Iglesia de San Nicolas de Tolentino' is one of the most picturesque churches in Asia.\n\n===Cabatuan Cemetery===\nThis century old Spanish-Filipino Cemetery is the only cemetery in the Philippines which is a perfect square. Three Byzantine arch entrances dominate the front-gate, while a baroque central chapel is located at the center. The chapel is a fusion of Roman, Gothic, Byzantine, and Baroque architectures. The complex carvings on the chapel's facade is considered to be the most distinct cemetery relief which can only be found in Cabatuan. Furthermore, this cemetery's neatness and organization is famous throughout the region.\n\n===The Town Hall===\nOne of the earliest town halls built in Northern Iloilo is the Cabatuan Municipal Hall. It was built in 1734 along with the Church. Calamities and war, however, damaged the second level of this public house and many renovations had been done. On the other hand, the designs were still derived from the original plan of the Casa. The first level of the town hall is already centuries old and its interior is characterized by the art deco cubical columns and semi-arched tuscan windows adorned with capiz shells.\n\n===Pamul-ogan Hill===\nThis shrine is considered to be the cradle of Cabatuan's History. At the peak of the hill lies a concrete cross reminiscent of the original cross planted by the Spaniards who first came in the region. Every lent, traditional devotees start their journey from the mouth of Barangay Pamulogan to the peak of the hill as penitence.\n\n===Baluarte Shrine===\nThis picturesque shrine located in Balic Hill, is one of the places in Cabatuan that attract many tourists and pilgrims during lenten season. On the peak is a cross, a replica of the one in Pamul-ogan Hill, and on the foot of the hill lies an art-deco chapel. The view at the cross offers an astounding view of the whole town.\n\n===The Tree of Bondage===\nThe Shrine of the Bondage Tree lies in the Town plaza directly in front of the Municipal Hall of Cabatuan. It is believed that the natives were tied in this tree and whipped if they refuse the ''polo'' or forced labor during the Spanish Era. The tree is an old and artistically skewed [[Plumeria]] tree (''Plumeria rubra'') currently fortified with a concrete base to withstand destruction.\n\n==Festivals and Events==\nThe town celebrates three main holidays: the Cabatuan Town Fiesta on September 10, as well as the Tinuom Festival that culminates the town fiesta and the strictly observed [[Lent]]en procession during [[Holy Week]].\n\n===Tinuom Festival===\nThe Tinuom Festival is a celebration of the town's history and its popularly craved delicacy, ''[[tinuom]]'' made of native chicken souped with spices - tomatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, and lemon grass and wrapped in banana leaves.<ref>One Town One Product - http://www.otopphilippines.gov.ph/microsite.aspx?rid=7&provid=65&prodid=743 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321181145/http://www.otopphilippines.gov.ph/microsite.aspx?rid=7&provid=65&prodid=743# |date=2009-03-21 }}</ref> This festival is one of the highlights of the 10-day fiesta celebration of the municipality and is a colorful explosion of music and dances patterned from Iloilo's [[Dinagyang|Kasadyahan Festival]].  There are six (6) competing groups (called tribes or \"tribu\" in the local dialect) composed of students from six secondary schools in Cabatuan. The groups are judged according to creativity, originality, costume, and choreography, among others. The winning group is the town's official representative to the Kasadyahan Festival in [[Iloilo City]] where the town has been actively participating in. This year, Tribu Ilahas from Tiring National High School, winner of the 2007 Tinuom Festival placed third in the Kasadayahan Competition.<ref>Official Site of the Municipality of Cabatuan - http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=12&Itemid=14 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911133212/http://www.cabatuan.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=12&Itemid=14# |date=2011-09-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Holy Week===\nCabatuan is also known to have the most wooden and porcelain statues being showcased on Lenten processions (a religious parade evident in almost all parishes in the [[Philippines]] during Holy Week). The most popular set of these figures is the wooden [[Last Supper]].\n\nIn the morning of [[Good Friday]], the statue of the Nazareno together with thousands of Cabatuananons and tourists alike follow a procession locally called ''Via Crucis'' from the Church to the Balic Hill pausing on the 14 Stations of the Cross erected along the path.\n\nIn the afternoon, on the other hand, another procession is held after the Good Friday Mass around the ''poblacion'' where the said wooden and porcelain statues embellished with fresh flowers, royal cloths and personalized lighting are paraded. They pass by the Stations of the Cross creatively displayed along in life-size carvings and effigies locally called ''Kapiya'' built out of indigenous materials native to the barangays assigned to the specific station. This unique display garnered recognition in [[Western Visayas]] and consequently haul tourists as well. ''Pasyon Singing'' by barangay folks accompanying their respective Kapiya follows the procession.<ref name=\"Tourist Attractions\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026213758/http://www.geocities.com/cabatuan_iloilo/Tourism/places.htm Tourist Attractions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nLastly, the ''Dampug'' culminates the Holy Week. It is the reenactment of the angel's proclamation of Christ's resurrection and his meeting with Mary. Every year, a child of an illustrious family in town is held as \u201cDampug\u201d or the proclaiming angel and a flamboyant stage, usually with cavern motif, is erected in the town plaza to serve as backdrop for the early dawn presentation. It is still very much respected by the townspeople today.<ref name=\"Tourist Attractions\" />\n\n==Facilities and services==\n\n===Health Services===\n\n====Rural Health Center====\nLocated at San Agustin Street right behind the plaza's covered courts, the Cabatuan Rural Health Center is the most accessible rural health center in the municipality. It caters to treatment of minor diseases and injury, vaccination, and limited laboratory testing.\n\n====Ramon Tabiana Memorial District Hospital====\nThe Ramon Tabiana Memorial District Hospital (RTMDH) located in Barangay Pungtod, Cabatuan is the major health service institution that serves the municipality and its neighboring towns. The hospital is headed by Dr. Levi Osea, has a 50-bed capacity, and is served by 76 personnel.

It was created by the merger of two existing organizations, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA) and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). Its membership, which was about seven thousand at the time it was formed, eventually increased to two million, making it the largest voluntary organization in the nation. It played a pivotal role in the passing of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which in 1920 guaranteed women's right to vote.\n\n[[Susan B. Anthony]], a long-time leader in the suffrage movement, was the dominant figure in the newly formed NAWSA. [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], who became president after Anthony retired in 1900, implemented a strategy of recruiting wealthy members of the rapidly growing [[women's club (United States)|women's club]] movement, whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. [[Anna Howard Shaw]]'s term in office, which began in 1904, saw strong growth in the organization's membership and public approval.\n\nAfter the Senate decisively rejected the proposed women's suffrage amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] in 1887, the suffrage movement had concentrated most of its efforts on state suffrage campaigns. In 1910 [[Alice Paul]] joined the NAWSA and played a major role in reviving interest in the national amendment. After continuing conflicts with the NAWSA leadership over tactics, Paul created a rival organization, the [[National Woman's Party]].\n\nWhen Catt again became president in 1915, the NAWSA adopted her plan to centralize the organization, and work toward the suffrage amendment as its primary goal. This was done despite opposition from Southern members who believed that a federal amendment would erode [[states' rights]]. With its large membership and the increasing number of women voters in states where suffrage had already been achieved, the NAWSA began to operate more as a political pressure group than an educational group. It won additional sympathy for the suffrage cause by actively cooperating with the war effort during World War I. On February 14, 1920, several months prior to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NAWSA transformed itself into the [[League of Women Voters]], which is still active.\n\n==Background==\nThe demand for [[women's suffrage in the United States]] was controversial even among women's rights activists in the early days of the movement. In 1848, a resolution in favor of women's right to vote was approved only after vigorous debate at the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention. By the time of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]]s in the 1850s, the situation had changed, and [[women's suffrage]] had become a preeminent goal of the movement.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|p=[https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/41 41]}}\nThree leaders of the women's movement during this period, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], played prominent roles in the creation of the NAWSA many years later.\n\nIn 1866, just after the [[American Civil War]], the Eleventh [[National Women's Rights Convention]] transformed itself into the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA), which worked for equal rights for both [[African Americans]] and white women, especially suffrage.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/170/mode/2up pp. 171\u201372]</ref>\nThe AERA essentially collapsed in 1869, partly because of disagreement over the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] African American men. Leaders of the women's movement were dismayed that it would not also enfranchise women. Stanton and Anthony opposed its ratification unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would enfranchise women.{{sfnp|Rakow|Kramarae|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA47 47]}}\nStone supported the amendment. She believed that its ratification would spur politicians to support a similar amendment for women. She said that even though the right to vote was more important for women than for black men, \"I will be thankful in my soul if ''any'' body can get out of the terrible pit.\"<ref>{{harvp|Cullen-DuPont|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&pg=PA13 13]}}, \"American Equal Rights Association\"</ref>\n\nIn May, 1869, two days after the acrimonious debates at what turned out to be the final AERA annual meeting, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA). In November 1869, the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) was formed by [[Lucy Stone]], her husband [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] and their allies, many of whom had helped to create the New England Woman Suffrage Association a year earlier as part of the developing split.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|pp=164-167, 189, 196}}\nThe bitter rivalry between the two organizations created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|p=[https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/173 173]}}\n\nEven after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, differences between the two organizations remained.

Laws that had allowed husbands to control their wives' activities had been significantly revised. There was a dramatic growth in all-female social reform organizations, such as the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), the largest women's organization in the country. In a major boost for the suffrage movement, the WCTU endorsed women's suffrage in the late 1870s on the grounds that women needed the vote to protect their families from alcohol and other vices.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA174 174\u201376]}}\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

Her aim was to unite the growing number of women's organizations in the demand for suffrage even if they did not support other women's rights issues. She and the NWSA also began placing less emphasis on confrontational actions and more on respectability. The NWSA was no longer seen as an organization that challenged traditional family arrangements by supporting, for example, what its opponents called \"easy divorce\". All this had the effect of moving it into closer alignment with the AWSA.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|pp=172\u2013175}}\nThe Senate's rejection in 1887 of the proposed women's suffrage amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] also brought the two organizations closer together. The NWSA had worked for years to convince Congress to bring the proposed amendment to a vote. After it was voted on and decisively rejected, the NWSA began to put less energy into campaigning at the federal level and more at the state level, as the AWSA was already doing.<ref name=Gordon-in-Wheeler>Gordon, Ann D, \"Woman Suffrage (Not Universal Suffrage) by Federal Amendment\" in Wheeler, Marjorie Spruill (ed.), (1995), ''Votes for Women!: The Woman Suffrage Movement in Tennessee, the South, and the Nation'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4sqiGdY0zDkC&pg=PA14 pp. 8, 14\u201316].

Accompanying Stone at this meeting was her daughter [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], who also was an officer of the AWSA. Stanton, who was in England at the time, did not attend. The meeting explored several aspects of a possible merger, including the name of the new organization and its structure. Stone had second thoughts soon afterwards, telling a friend she wished they had never offered to unite, but the merger process slowly continued.{{sfnp|McMillen|2015|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nAn early public sign of improving relations between the two organizations occurred three months later at the founding congress of the [[International Council of Women]], which the NWSA organized and hosted in Washington in conjunction with the fortieth anniversary of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]]. It received favorable publicity, and its delegates, who came from fifty-three women's organizations in nine countries, were invited to a reception at the [[White House]].

The call to its annual meeting in 1887, the one that authorized Stone to explore the possibility of merger, did not even mention that this issue would be on the agenda. This proposal was treated in a routine manner during the meeting and was approved unanimously without debate.{{sfnp|Gordon|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&pg=PA54 54\u201355]}}\n\nThe situation was different within the NWSA, where there was strong opposition from [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], [[Olympia Brown]] and others.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|p=179}}\n[[Ida Husted Harper]], Anthony's co-worker and biographer, said the NWSA meetings that dealt with this issue \"were the most stormy in the history of the association.\"<ref>Ida Husted Harper ''The Life and Work of Susan B.

Anthony's pre-merger NWSA had always held its conventions in Washington to help maintain focus on a national suffrage amendment. Anthony said she feared, accurately as it turned out, that the NAWSA would engage in suffrage work at the state level at the expense of national work.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA213 212-213]}}\nThe NAWSA routinely allocated no funding at all for congressional work, which at this stage consisted only of one day of testimony before Congress each year.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=8}}\n\n===''Woman's Bible''===\nStanton's radicalism did not sit well with the new organization. In 1895 she published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', a controversial best-seller that attacked the use of the ''[[Bible]]'' to relegate women to an inferior status. Her opponents within the NAWSA reacted strongly. They felt that the book would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Rachel Foster Avery, the organization's corresponding secretary, sharply denounced Stanton's book in her annual report to the 1896 convention. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with the book despite Anthony's strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful. \n\nThe negative reaction to the book contributed to a sharp decline in Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement and to her increasing alienation from it.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|pp=182, 188\u201391}} She sent letters to each NAWSA convention, however, and Anthony insisted that they be read even when their topics were controversial.{{sfnp|Griffith|1984|p=[https://archive.org/details/beth00elis/page/205 205]}}\nStanton died in 1902.\n\n===Southern strategy===\nThe South had traditionally shown little interest in women's suffrage. When the proposed suffrage amendment  to the [[United States Constitution| Constitution]] was rejected by the Senate in 1887, it received no votes at all from southern senators.{{sfnp|McMillen|2008|p=207}}\nThis indicated a problem for the future because it was almost impossible for any amendment to be ratified by the required number of states without at least some support from the South.\n\nHenry Blackwell proposed a solution: convince southern political leaders that they could ensure [[white supremacy]] in their region by enfranchising educated women, who would predominantly be white. Blackwell presented his plan to politicians from [[Mississippi]], who gave it serious consideration, a development that drew the interest of many suffragists. Blackwell's ally in this effort was [[Laura Clay]], who convinced the NAWSA to launch a campaign in the South based on Blackwell's strategy. Clay was one of several southern NAWSA members who objected to the proposed national women's suffrage amendment on the grounds that it would impinge on [[states' rights]].{{sfnp|Wheeler|1993|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA113 113\u201315]}}\n\nAmid predictions that the South would lead the way in the enfranchisement of women, suffrage organizations were established throughout the region. Anthony, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] (NAWSA's organizational secretary) and Blackwell campaigned for suffrage in the South in 1895, with the latter two calling for suffrage only for educated women. With Anthony's reluctant cooperation, the NAWSA maneuvered to accommodate the politics of white supremacy in that region. Anthony asked her old friend Frederick Douglass, a former slave, not to attend the NAWSA convention in Atlanta in 1895, the first to be held in a southern city. Black NAWSA members were excluded from 1903 convention in the southern city of New Orleans. The NAWSA executive board issued a statement during the convention that said, \"The doctrine of State's rights is recognized in the national body, and each auxiliary State association arranges its own affairs in accordance with its own ideas and in harmony with the customs of its own section.\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=23}}\nNo southern state enfranchised women as a result of this strategy, however, and most suffrage societies that were established in the South during this period lapsed into inactivity.{{sfnp|Wheeler|1993|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA115 115\u2013120]}}\n\n==First Catt presidency==\n[[Carrie Chapman Catt]] joined the suffrage movement in Iowa in the mid-1880s. and soon became part of the leadership of the state suffrage association. Married to a wealthy engineer who encouraged her suffrage work, she was able to devote much of her energy to the movement. In 1895, she was placed in charge of NAWSA's Organizational Committee, where she raised money to put a team of fourteen organizers in the field. By 1899, suffrage organizations had been established in every state. When Anthony retired as NAWSA president in 1900, she arranged for Catt, who had not been closely associated with either the NWSA or the AWSA, to succeed her.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=7}}\nAnthony remained an influential figure in the organization, however, until she died in 1906.\n\n[[File:Carrie Chapman Catt - National Woman's Party Records.jpg|thumb|left|Carrie Chapman Catt]]\n\nOne of Catt's first actions as president was to implement the \"society plan,\" a campaign to recruit wealthy members of the rapidly growing [[women's club (United States)|women's club]] movement, whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. The list of organizations suggested as contacts for recruitment did not include the flourishing black women's club movement, implying a goal of attracting mostly white women.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=36\u201337}}\nPrimarily composed of middle-class women, the targeted clubs often engaged in civic improvement projects. They generally avoided controversial issues, but women's suffrage increasingly found acceptance among their membership.<ref>Stephen M.

Stanton's role in the movement was obscured by this process, as were the roles of black and working women.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=43}}\nAnthony, who in her younger days was often treated as a dangerous fanatic, was given a grandmotherly image and honored as a \"suffrage saint.\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=47\u201348}}\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Women's Suffrage Parade, 1917 cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|Mural in U.S. Capitol  featuring NAWSA leaders [[Anna Howard Shaw]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]]]\nThe reform energy of the [[Progressive Era]] strengthened the suffrage movement during this period. Beginning around 1900, this broad movement began at the grassroots level with such goals as combating corruption in government, eliminating child labor, and protecting workers and consumers. Many of its participants saw women's suffrage as yet another progressive goal, and they believed that the addition of women to the electorate would help the movement achieve its other goals.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA28 28\u201329]}}\n\nCatt resigned her position after four years, partly because of her husband's declining health and partly to help organize the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], which was created in Berlin in 1904 in coordination with the NAWSA and with Catt as president.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA231 231\u201332]}}\n\n==Shaw presidency==\nIn 1904, [[Anna Howard Shaw]], another Anthony prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was elected president of the NAWSA, serving more years in that office than any other person.

The Equality League gained a following by engaging in activities that many members of the NAWSA initially considered too daring, such as suffrage parades and open air rallies.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA242 242\u201346]}}\nBlatch said that when she joined the suffrage movement in the U.S., \"The only method suggested for furthering the cause was the slow process of education. We were told to organize, organize, organize, to the end of educating, educating, educating public opinion.\"{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA243 243]}}\n\nIn 1908, the [[College Equal Suffrage League|National College Equal Suffrage League]] was formed as an affiliate of the NAWSA. It had its origins in the College Equal Suffrage League, which was formed in Boston in 1900 at a time when there were relatively few college students in the NAWSA. It was established by [[Maud Wood Park]], who later helped create similar groups in 30 states. Park later became a prominent leader of the NAWSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444021/Maud-Wood-Park |title=Maud Wood Park |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>Jana Nidiffer, \"Suffrage, FPS, and History of Higher Education.\" in Allen, Elizabeth J., et al.

She and her co-workers developed a detailed plan to unite the various suffrage associations in New York City (and later in the entire state) in an organization modeled on political machines like [[Tammany Hall]]. In 1909, they founded the Woman Suffrage Party (WSP) at a convention attended by over a thousand delegates and alternates. By 1910, the WSP had 20,000 members and a four-room headquarters. Shaw was not entirely comfortable with the independent initiatives of the WSP, but Catt and other of its leaders remained loyal to the NAWSA, its parent organization.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nIn 1909, Frances Squires Potter, a NAWSA member from Chicago, proposed the creation of suffrage community centers called \"political settlements.\" Reminiscent of the social [[settlement movement|settlement houses]], such as [[Hull House]] in Chicago, their purpose was to educate the public about suffrage and the practical details of political activity at the local level. The political settlements established by the WSP included suffrage schools that provided training in public speaking to suffrage organizers.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nPublic sentiment toward the suffrage movement improved dramatically during this period. Working for suffrage came to be seen as a respectable activity for middle-class women. By 1910, NAWSA membership had jumped to 117,000.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=51\u201352}}\nThe NAWSA established its first permanent headquarters that year in New York City, previously having operated mainly out of the homes of its officers.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=241, 251}}\nMaud Wood Park, who had been away in Europe for two years, received a letter that year from one of her co-workers in the College Equal Suffrage League who described the new atmosphere by saying, \"the movement which when we got into it had about as much energy as a dying kitten, is now a big, virile, threatening thing\" and is \"actually fashionable now.\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=54}}\n\nThe change in public sentiment was reflected in efforts to win suffrage at the state level. In 1896, only four states, all of them in the West, allowed women to vote. From 1896 to 1910, there were six state campaigns for suffrage, and they all failed. The tide began to turn in 1910 when suffrage was won in the state of Washington, followed by California in 1911, Oregon, Kansas and Arizona in 1912, and others afterwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=One Woman, One Vote: Rediscovering the Woman Suffrage Movement |last=Wheeler |first=Marjorie Spruil|editor-last= Wheeler|editor-first= Marjorie Spruil|year=1995|chapter=Introduction: A Short History of the Woman Suffrage Movement in America |publisher=NewSage Press |location=Troutdale, Oregon |isbn=978-0939165261|pages=11, 14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ClfuAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Official Program Woman Suffrage Procession - March 3, 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Program for NAWSA's [[Woman suffrage parade of 1913|Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913]] in Washington]]\n\nIn 1912, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), publicly challenged NAWSA's reluctance to accept black women. The NAWSA responded in a cordial way, inviting him to speak at its next convention and publishing his speech as a pamphlet.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=138\u201339}}\nNonetheless the NAWSA continued to minimize the role of black suffragists. It accepted some black women as members and some black societies as auxiliaries, but its general practice was to turn such requests politely away.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=23\u201324}}\nThis was partly because attitudes of racial superiority were the norm among white Americans of that era, and partly because the NAWSA believed it had little hope of achieving a national amendment without at least some support from southern states that practiced [[racial segregation]].{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sZfmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 8, 81]}}\n\nNAWSA's strategy at that point was to gain suffrage for women on a state-by-state basis until it achieved a critical mass of voters that could push through a suffrage amendment at the national level.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|p=189}}\nIn 1913, the Southern States Woman Suffrage Committee was formed in an attempt to stop that process from moving past the state level. It was led by Kate Gordon, who had been the NAWSA's corresponding secretary from 1901 to 1909.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA298 298]}}\nGordon, who was from the southern state of Louisiana, supported women's suffrage, but opposed the idea of a federal suffrage amendment, charging that it would violate [[states' rights]]. She said that empowering federal authorities to enforce a constitutional right for women to vote in the South could lead to similar enforcement of the constitutional right of African Americans to vote there, a right that was being evaded, and, in her opinion, rightly so. Her committee was too small to seriously affect the NAWSA's direction, but her public condemnation of the proposed amendment, expressed in terms of vehement racism, deepened fissures within the organization.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=83, 118}}\n\n== Relocation to Warren, Ohio ==\nFor several years, [[Harriet Taylor Upton]] led the woman suffragist movement in [[Trumbull County, Ohio]]. In 1880, Upton's father was elected as a member of the [[United States Congress]] as a Republican from Ohio. This connection provided Upton the opportunity to meet Susan B. Anthony, who brought Upton into the suffragist movement. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ideas of the Woman Suffrage Movement, 1890-1920 [1965]|last=Kraditor|first=Aileen S.|publisher=W.W.

In addition, Upton served as president of the Ohio association of the national association, from 1899-1908 and 1911\u20131920. Upton helped relocate the national headquarters for the NAWSA to [[Harriet Taylor Upton House|her home]] in [[Warren, Ohio]], in 1903. According to the [[Tribune Chronicle]], \"it was only supposed to be a temporary move, but it lasted six years. Susan B. Anthony, noted leader of the women's movement, visited Warren many times, including a 1904 trip to attend a national women's rights meeting here.\" <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Warren Played Big Role in Women's Suffragist Movement|last=|first=|date=August 26, 1975|work=The Tribune Chronicle|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nDuring this period, the nation's attention regarding women's rights was focused on Warren. The association's offices were located on the ground level of the Trumbull Court House, a building currently occupied by the Probate Court. While the headquarters left the Upton House around 1910, Warren remained active in the suffrage movement. The people of Warren were active in various programs of the national movement for years, until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] was ratified by a sufficient number of states, and authorized by [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] in 1920. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Warren Played Big Role in Women's Suffrage Movement|last=|first=|date=August 26, 1975|work=The Tribune Chronicle|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1993, the Upton House joined the list of historic landmarks. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Upton House to join list of historic landmarks|last=Johnson|first=Stephanie|date=January 23, 1993|work=The Tribune Chronicle|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Split in the movement==\nA serious challenge to the NAWSA leadership began to develop after a young activist named [[Alice Paul]] returned to the U.S. from England in 1910, where she had been part of the militant wing of the suffrage movement. She had been jailed there and had endured [[force-feeding|forced feedings]] after going on a hunger strike.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA256 255\u201357]}}\nJoining the NAWSA, she became the person most responsible for reviving interest within the suffrage movement for a national amendment, which for years had been overshadowed by campaigns for suffrage at the state level.<ref name=Gordon-in-Wheeler/>\n\n[[File:Alice Paul cph.3a38295.jpg|thumb|Alice Paul]]\n\nFrom Shaw's point of view, the time was right for a renewed emphasis on a suffrage amendment. Gordon and Clay, the most persistent adversaries of a federal suffrage amendment within NAWSA, had been out-maneuvered by their opponents and no longer held national posts.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=140, 142}}\nIn 1912, Alice Paul was appointed chair of NAWSA's Congressional Committee and charged with reviving the drive for a women's suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker [[Lucy Burns]] organized a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s inauguration as president. Onlookers who opposed the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order. Public outrage over the incident, which cost the chief of police his job, brought publicity to the movement and gave it fresh momentum.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA256 255\u201357]}}\n\nPaul troubled NAWSA leaders by arguing that because Democrats would not act to enfranchise women even though they controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress, the suffrage movement should work for the defeat of all Democrats regardless of an individual candidate's position on suffrage. NAWSA's policy was to follow the opposite approach, supporting any candidate who endorsed suffrage, regardless of political party.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA31 31]}}\nIn 1913, Paul and Burns formed the [[Congressional Union]] (CU) to work solely for a national amendment and sent organizers into states that already had NAWSA organizations. The relationship between the CU and the NAWSA became unclear and troubled over time.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA258 257\u201359]}}\n\nAt the NAWSA convention in 1913, Paul and her allies demanded that the organization focus its efforts on a federal suffrage amendment. The convention instead empowered the executive board to limit the CU's ability to contravene NAWSA policies. After negotiations failed to resolve their differences, the NAWSA removed Paul as head of its Congressional Committee. By February, 1914, the NAWSA and the CU had effectively separated into two independent organizations.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA258 257\u201359]}}\n\nBlatch merged her Women's Political Union into the CU.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|p=146}}\nThat organization in turn became the basis for the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), which Paul formed in 1916.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Woman's Crusade: Alice Paul and the Battle for the Ballot|last=Walton |first=Mary |year=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-230-61175-7|pages=133, 158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAWbMy0IvkkC |accessdate=}}</ref>\nOnce again there were two competing national women's suffrage organizations, but the result this time was something like a division of labor. The NAWSA burnished its image of respectability and engaged in highly organized lobbying at both the national and state levels. The smaller NWP also engaged in lobbying but became increasingly known for activities that were dramatic and confrontational, most often in the national capital.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA32 32\u201333]}}\n\n==Second Catt presidency==\nDespite the rapid growth in NAWSA membership, discontent with Shaw grew. Her tendency to overreact to those who differed with her had the effect of increasing organizational friction.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=241}}\nSeveral members resigned from executive board in 1910, and the board saw significant changes in its composition every year after that through 1915.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA250 250]}}\n\n===1914\u201315===\n[[File:History of woman suffrage (1881) (14778322302).jpg|thumb|left|Helen Hamilton Gardener, Carrie Chapman Catt and Maud Wood Park (from left to right) on the balcony of Suffrage House, the Washington headquarters of the National American Woman Suffrage Association]]\n\nIn 1914, Senator [[John Shafroth]]<!--His first name was John per Van Voris p. 130 --> introduced a federal amendment that would require state legislatures to put women's suffrage on the state ballot if eight percent of the voters signed a petition to that effect. The NAWSA endorsed the proposed amendment, whereupon the CU accused it of abandoning the drive for a national suffrage amendment. Amid confusion among the membership, delegates at the 1914 convention directed their dissatisfaction at Shaw.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=156\u201357}}\nShaw had considered declining the presidency in 1914, but decided to run again. In 1915, she announced that she would not be running for reelection.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=156, 162}}\n\nCatt was the obvious choice to replace her, but she was leading the New York State Woman Suffrage Party, which was in the early stages of a crucial suffrage campaign in that state.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=28\u201329}}\nThe prevailing belief in the NAWSA was that success in a large eastern state would be the tipping point for the national campaign.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|p=142}}\nNew York was the largest state in the union, and victory there was a real possibility. Catt agreed to turn the New York work over to others and to accept the NAWSA presidency in December, 1915 on the condition that she could name her own executive board, which previously had always been elected by the annual convention. She appointed to the board women of independent means who could work for the movement full-time.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA266 265\u201367]}}\n\nBacked by an increased level of commitment and unity in the national office, Catt sent its officers into the field to assess the state of the organization and start the process of reorganizing it into a more centralized and efficient operation. Catt described the NAWSA as a camel with a hundred humps, each with a blind driver trying to lead the way. She provided a new sense of direction by sending out a stream of communications to state and local affiliates with policy directives, organizational initiatives and detailed plans of work.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA266 265\u201367]}}{{sfnp|Van Voris|1987|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&pg=PA131 131\u201332]}}\n\nThe NAWSA previously had devoted much of its effort to educating the public about suffrage, and it had made a significant impact. Women's suffrage had become a major national issue, and the NAWSA was in the process of becoming the nation's largest voluntary organization, with two million members.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|p=39}}\nCatt built on that foundation to convert the NAWSA into an organization that operated primarily as a political pressure group.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=83, 118}}\n\n===1916===\nAt an executive board meeting in March, 1916, Catt described the organization's dilemma by saying, \"The Congressional Union is drawing off from the National Association those women who feel it is possible to work for suffrage by the Federal route only. Certain workers in the south are being antagonized because the National is continuing to work for the Federal Amendment. The combination has produced a great muddle\".{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=267}}\nCatt believed that NAWSA's policy of working primarily on state-by-state campaigns was nearing its limits. Some states appeared unlikely ever to approve women's suffrage, in some cases because state laws made constitutional revision extremely difficult, and in others, especially in the Deep South, because opposition was simply too strong.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=143\u2013144}}\nCatt refocused the organization on a national suffrage amendment while continuing to conduct state campaigns where success was a realistic possibility.\n\nWhen the conventions of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views in a speech to the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nBoth party conventions endorsed women's suffrage but only at the state level, which meant that different states might implement it in different ways and in some cases not at all. Having expected more, Catt called an Emergency Convention, moving the date of the 1916 convention from December to September to begin organizing a renewed push for the federal amendment.{{sfnp|Van Voris|1987|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&pg=PA131 131\u201332]}}\nThe convention initiated a strategic shift by adopting Catt's \"Winning Plan\". This plan mandated work toward the national suffrage amendment as the priority for the entire organization and authorized the creation of a professional lobbying team to support this goal in Washington. It authorized the executive board to specify a plan of work toward this goal for each state and to take over that work if the state organization refused to comply. It agreed to fund state suffrage campaigns only if they met strict requirements that were designed to eliminate efforts with little chance of succeeding.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=87\u201390}}\nCatt's plan included milestones for achieving a women's suffrage amendment by 1922.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=274}}\nGordon, whose states' rights approach had been decisively defeated, exclaimed to a friend, \"A well-oiled steam roller has ironed this convention flat!\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=88}}\n\nPresident Wilson, whose attitude toward women's suffrage was evolving, spoke at the 1916 NAWSA convention.  He had been considered an opponent of suffrage when he was governor of New Jersey, but in 1915 he announced that he was traveling from the White House back to his home state to vote in favor of it in New Jersey's state referendum. He spoke favorably of suffrage at the NAWSA convention but stopped short of supporting the suffrage amendment.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=271\u2013272}}\n[[Charles Evans Hughes]], his opponent in the presidential election that year, declined to speak at the convention, but he went farther than Wilson by endorsing the suffrage amendment.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=187 endnote 25}}\n\n[[File:Gardener-Catt-1920.jpg|thumb|left|Carrie Chapman Catt (right) exiting the White House with Helen Hamilton Gardener]]\n\nNAWSA's Congressional Committee had been in disarray ever since Alice Paul was removed from it in 1913. Catt reorganized the committee and appointed Maud Wood Park as its head in December, 1916. Park and her lieutenant [[Helen Hamilton Gardener]] created what became known as the \"Front Door Lobby\", so named by a journalist because it operated openly, avoiding the traditional lobbying methods of \"backstairs\" dealing. A headquarters for the lobbying effort was established in a dilapidated mansion known as Suffrage House. NAWSA lobbyists lodged there and coordinated their activities with daily conferences in its meeting rooms.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nIn 1916 the NAWSA purchased the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'' from Alice Stone Blackwell. The newspaper had been established in 1870 by Blackwell's mother, Lucy Stone, and had served as the primary voice of the suffrage movement most of the time since then. It had significant limitations, however. It was a small operation, with Blackwell herself doing most of the work, and with much of its reporting centered on the eastern part of the country at a time when a national newspaper was needed.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=116\u2013117}}\nAfter the transfer, it was renamed ''Woman Citizen'' and merged with ''The Woman Voter'', the journal of the Woman Suffrage Party of New York City, and with ''National Suffrage News'', the former journal of the NAWSA.<ref name=leslie-com>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/naw:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbnawsan4830div12)) \"The record of the Leslie woman suffrage commission, inc., 1917\u20131929\", by Rose Young.]</ref> \nThe newspaper's masthead declared itself to be the NAWSA's official organ.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n===1917===\nIn 1917 Catt received a [[bequest]] of $900,000 from [[Miriam Leslie|Mrs. Frank (Miriam) Leslie]] to be used as she thought best for the women's suffrage movement.

Catt and two other NAWSA members were appointed to its executive committee.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=103}}\nThe NWP, by contrast, took no part in the war effort and charged that the NAWSA did so at the expense of suffrage work.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA276 276, 377 endnote 16]}}\n\nIn April, 1917, [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana took her seat as the first woman in Congress, having previously served as lobbyist and field secretary for the NAWSA.

President Catt gave the opening address, in which she urged the delegates to create a league of women voters. A resolution was passed to form this league as a separate unit of NAWSA, with membership coming from states who allowed women to vote. The league was charged with achieving full suffrage and consideration of legislation that affected women in states where they were able to vote. On the last day of the convention, the Missouri senate passed legislation giving women the right to vote in presidential elections in Missouri and a resolution to submit a constitutional amendment for full suffrage. In June of that year, the Nineteenth Amendment was passed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Her Place: A Guide to St. Louis Women's History|last=Corbett|first=Katharine T.|publisher=Missouri History Museum|year=1999|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Passage of the Nineteenth Amendment===\nAfter the elections, Wilson called a special session of Congress, which passed the suffrage amendment on June 4, 1919.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=307\u2013308}}\nThe struggle now passed to the state legislatures, three-fourths of which would need to ratify the amendment before it would become law.\n\nCatt and the NAWSA executive board had been planning their work in support of the ratification effort since April, 1918, over a year before Congress passed the amendment.

It was created by the merger of two existing organizations, the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA) and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). Its membership, which was about seven thousand at the time it was formed, eventually increased to two million, making it the largest voluntary organization in the nation. It played a pivotal role in the passing of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which in 1920 guaranteed women's right to vote.\n\n[[Susan B. Anthony]], a long-time leader in the suffrage movement, was the dominant figure in the newly formed NAWSA. [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], who became president after Anthony retired in 1900, implemented a strategy of recruiting wealthy members of the rapidly growing [[women's club (United States)|women's club]] movement, whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. [[Anna Howard Shaw]]'s term in office, which began in 1904, saw strong growth in the organization's membership and public approval.\n\nAfter the Senate decisively rejected the proposed women's suffrage amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] in 1887, the suffrage movement had concentrated most of its efforts on state suffrage campaigns. In 1910 [[Alice Paul]] joined the NAWSA and played a major role in reviving interest in the national amendment. After continuing conflicts with the NAWSA leadership over tactics, Paul created a rival organization, the [[National Woman's Party]].\n\nWhen Catt again became president in 1915, the NAWSA adopted her plan to centralize the organization, and work toward the suffrage amendment as its primary goal. This was done despite opposition from southern members who believed that a federal amendment would erode [[states' rights]]. With its large membership and the increasing number of women voters in states where suffrage had already been achieved, the NAWSA began to operate more as a political pressure group than an educational group. It won additional sympathy for the suffrage cause by actively cooperating with the war effort during World War I. On February 14, 1920, several months prior to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NAWSA transformed itself into the [[League of Women Voters]], which is still active.\n\n==Background==\nThe demand for [[women's suffrage in the United States]] was controversial even among women's rights activists in the early days of the movement. In 1848, a resolution in favor of women's right to vote was approved only after vigorous debate at the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention. By the time of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]]s in the 1850s, the situation had changed, and [[women's suffrage]] had become a preeminent goal of the movement.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|p=[https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/41 41]}}\nThree leaders of the women's movement during this period, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], played prominent roles in the creation of the NAWSA many years later.\n\nIn 1866, just after the [[American Civil War]], the Eleventh [[National Women's Rights Convention]] transformed itself into the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA), which worked for equal rights for both [[African Americans]] and white women, especially suffrage.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881\u20131922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/170/mode/2up pp. 171\u201372]</ref>\nThe AERA essentially collapsed in 1869, partly because of disagreement over the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] African American men. Leaders of the women's movement were dismayed that it would not also enfranchise women. Stanton and Anthony opposed its ratification unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would enfranchise women.{{sfnp|Rakow|Kramarae|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA47 47]}}\nStone supported the amendment. She believed that its ratification would spur politicians to support a similar amendment for women. She said that even though the right to vote was more important for women than for black men, \"I will be thankful in my soul if ''any'' body can get out of the terrible pit.\"<ref>{{harvp|Cullen-DuPont|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&pg=PA13 13]}}, \"American Equal Rights Association\"</ref>\n\nIn May, 1869, two days after the acrimonious debates at what turned out to be the final AERA annual meeting, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA). In November 1869, the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) was formed by [[Lucy Stone]], her husband [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] and their allies, many of whom had helped to create the New England Woman Suffrage Association a year earlier as part of the developing split.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|pp=164-167, 189, 196}}\nThe bitter rivalry between the two organizations created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|p=[https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/173 173]}}\n\nEven after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, differences between the two organizations remained. The AWSA worked almost exclusively for women's suffrage while the NWSA initially worked on a wide range of issues, including divorce reform and [[equal pay for women]]. The AWSA included both men and women among its leadership while the NWSA was led by women.{{sfnp|DuBois|1978|pp=192, [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/196 196], [https://archive.org/details/feminismsuffrage00dubo_0/page/197 197]}}\nThe AWSA worked for suffrage mostly at the state level while the NWSA worked more at the national level.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA17 17]}}\nThe AWSA cultivated an image of respectability while the NWSA sometimes used confrontational tactics. Anthony, for example, interrupted the official ceremonies at the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence to present NWSA's Declaration of Rights for Women.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA163 163\u201364]}}\nAnthony was arrested in 1872 for voting, which was still illegal for women, and was found guilty in a highly publicized trial.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_anthony_narrative.html |title=The Trial of Susan B.

By 1890, tens of thousands of women were attending colleges and universities, up from zero a few decades earlier.<ref>Solomon, Barbara Miller (1985).

New Haven, Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-03639-6}}</ref>\nThere was a decline in public support for the idea of \"woman's sphere\", the belief that a woman's place was in the home and that she should not be involved in politics. Laws that had allowed husbands to control their wives' activities had been significantly revised. There was a dramatic growth in all-female social reform organizations, such as the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), the largest women's organization in the country. In a major boost for the suffrage movement, the WCTU endorsed women's suffrage in the late 1870s on the grounds that women needed the vote to protect their families from alcohol and other vices.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA174 174\u201376]}}\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth Cady Stanton (seated) with Susan B. Anthony]]\n\nAnthony increasingly began to emphasize suffrage over other women's rights issues. Her aim was to unite the growing number of women's organizations in the demand for suffrage even if they did not support other women's rights issues. She and the NWSA also began placing less emphasis on confrontational actions and more on respectability. The NWSA was no longer seen as an organization that challenged traditional family arrangements by supporting, for example, what its opponents called \"easy divorce\". All this had the effect of moving it into closer alignment with the AWSA.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|pp=172\u2013175}}\nThe Senate's rejection in 1887 of the proposed women's suffrage amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] also brought the two organizations closer together. The NWSA had worked for years to convince Congress to bring the proposed amendment to a vote. After it was voted on and decisively rejected, the NWSA began to put less energy into campaigning at the federal level and more at the state level, as the AWSA was already doing.<ref name=Gordon-in-Wheeler>Gordon, Ann D, \"Woman Suffrage (Not Universal Suffrage) by Federal Amendment\" in Wheeler, Marjorie Spruill (ed.), (1995), ''Votes for Women!: The Woman Suffrage Movement in Tennessee, the South, and the Nation'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=4sqiGdY0zDkC&pg=PA14 pp. 8, 14\u201316].

She advocated a coalition of radical social reform groups, including Populists and Socialists, who would support women's suffrage as part of a joint list of demands.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|pp=172, 183}}\nIn a letter to a friend, Stanton said the NWSA \"has been growing politic and conservative for some time. Lucy [Stone] and Susan [Anthony] alike see suffrage only. They do not see woman's religious and social bondage, neither do the young women in either association, hence they may as well combine\".<ref>Letter from Stanton to Olympia Brown, May 8, 1888, quoted in {{harvp|Barry|1988|p=293}}.</ref>\nStanton, however, had largely withdrawn from the day-to-day activity of the suffrage movement.{{sfnp|McMillen|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TzVRlFXiYswC&pg=PA224 224\u2013225]}}\nShe spent much of her time with her daughter in England during this period.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|p=183}}\nDespite their different approaches, Stanton and Anthony remained friends and co-workers, continuing a collaboration that had begun in the early 1850s.\n\nStone devoted most of her life after the split to the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'', a weekly newspaper she launched in 1870 to serve as voice of the AWSA.{{sfnp|McMillen|2015|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tPCRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA190 188\u2013190]}}\nBy the 1880s, the ''Woman's Journal'' had broadened its coverage and was seen by many as the newspaper of the entire movement.{{sfnp|McMillen|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TzVRlFXiYswC&pg=PA224 224\u2013225]}}\n\nThe suffrage movement was attracting younger members who were impatient with the continuing division, seeing the obstacle more as a matter of personalities than principles. [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], daughter of Lucy Stone, said, \"When I began to work for a union, the elders were not keen for it, on either side, but the younger women on both sides were. Nothing really stood in the way except the unpleasant feelings engendered during the long separation\".<ref>Alice Stone Blackwell (1930).

In a letter to suffragist [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]], she suggested the creation of an umbrella organization of which the AWSA and the NWSA would become auxiliaries, but that idea did not gain supporters.{{sfnp|McMillen|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TzVRlFXiYswC&pg=PA224 224\u2013225]}}\nIn November 1887, the AWSA annual meeting passed a resolution authorizing Stone to confer with Anthony about the possibility of a merger.

Accompanying Stone at this meeting was her daughter [[Alice Stone Blackwell]], who also was an officer of the AWSA. Stanton, who was in England at the time, did not attend. The meeting explored several aspects of a possible merger, including the name of the new organization and its structure. Stone had second thoughts soon afterwards, telling a friend she wished they had never offered to unite, but the merger process slowly continued.{{sfnp|McMillen|2015|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nAn early public sign of improving relations between the two organizations occurred three months later at the founding congress of the [[International Council of Women]], which the NWSA organized and hosted in Washington in conjunction with the fortieth anniversary of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]]. It received favorable publicity, and its delegates, who came from fifty-three women's organizations in nine countries, were invited to a reception at the [[White House]]. Representatives from the AWSA were invited to sit on the platform during the meetings along with representatives from the NWSA, signaling a new atmosphere of cooperation.{{sfnp|Barry|1988|pp=283-287}}\n\nThe proposed merger did not generate significant controversy within the AWSA. The call to its annual meeting in 1887, the one that authorized Stone to explore the possibility of merger, did not even mention that this issue would be on the agenda. This proposal was treated in a routine manner during the meeting and was approved unanimously without debate.{{sfnp|Gordon|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&pg=PA54 54\u201355]}}\n\nThe situation was different within the NWSA, where there was strong opposition from [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], [[Olympia Brown]] and others.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|p=179}}\n[[Ida Husted Harper]], Anthony's co-worker and biographer, said the NWSA meetings that dealt with this issue \"were the most stormy in the history of the association.\"<ref>Ida Husted Harper ''The Life and Work of Susan B.

The executive committee recommended that AWSA delegates vote for Anthony. At the NWSA meeting, Anthony strongly urged its members not to vote for her but for Stanton, saying that a defeat of Stanton would be viewed as a repudiation of her role in the movement.{{sfnp|Gordon|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&pg=PA246 246]}}\n\nElections were held at the convention's opening.

Anthony's pre-merger NWSA had always held its conventions in Washington to help maintain focus on a national suffrage amendment. Anthony said she feared, accurately as it turned out, that the NAWSA would engage in suffrage work at the state level at the expense of national work.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA213 212-213]}}\nThe NAWSA routinely allocated no funding at all for congressional work, which at this stage consisted only of one day of testimony before Congress each year.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=8}}\n\n===''Woman's Bible''===\nStanton's radicalism did not sit well with the new organization. In 1895 she published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', a controversial best-seller that attacked the use of the ''[[Bible]]'' to relegate women to an inferior status. Her opponents within the NAWSA reacted strongly. They felt that the book would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Rachel Foster Avery, the organization's corresponding secretary, sharply denounced Stanton's book in her annual report to the 1896 convention. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with the book despite Anthony's strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful. \n\nThe negative reaction to the book contributed to a sharp decline in Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement and to her increasing alienation from it.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|pp=182, 188\u201391}} She sent letters to each NAWSA convention, however, and Anthony insisted that they be read even when their topics were controversial.{{sfnp|Griffith|1984|p=[https://archive.org/details/beth00elis/page/205 205]}}\nStanton died in 1902.\n\n===Southern strategy===\nThe South had traditionally shown little interest in women's suffrage. When the proposed suffrage amendment  to the [[United States Constitution| Constitution]] was rejected by the Senate in 1887, it received no votes at all from southern senators.{{sfnp|McMillen|2008|p=207}}\nThis indicated a problem for the future because it was almost impossible for any amendment to be ratified by the required number of states without at least some support from the South.\n\nHenry Blackwell proposed a solution: convince southern political leaders that they could ensure [[white supremacy]] in their region by enfranchising educated women, who would predominantly be white. Blackwell presented his plan to politicians from [[Mississippi]], who gave it serious consideration, a development that drew the interest of many suffragists. Blackwell's ally in this effort was [[Laura Clay]], who convinced the NAWSA to launch a campaign in the South based on Blackwell's strategy. Clay was one of several southern NAWSA members who objected to the proposed national women's suffrage amendment on the grounds that it would impinge on [[states' rights]].{{sfnp|Wheeler|1993|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA113 113\u201315]}}\n\nAmid predictions that the South would lead the way in the enfranchisement of women, suffrage organizations were established throughout the region. Anthony, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] (NAWSA's organizational secretary) and Blackwell campaigned for suffrage in the South in 1895, with the latter two calling for suffrage only for educated women. With Anthony's reluctant cooperation, the NAWSA maneuvered to accommodate the politics of white supremacy in that region. Anthony asked her old friend Frederick Douglass, a former slave, not to attend the NAWSA convention in Atlanta in 1895, the first to be held in a southern city. Black NAWSA members were excluded from 1903 convention in the southern city of New Orleans. The NAWSA executive board issued a statement during the convention that said, \"The doctrine of State's rights is recognized in the national body, and each auxiliary State association arranges its own affairs in accordance with its own ideas and in harmony with the customs of its own section.\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=23}}\nNo southern state enfranchised women as a result of this strategy, however, and most suffrage societies that were established in the South during this period lapsed into inactivity.{{sfnp|Wheeler|1993|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA115 115\u2013120]}}\n\n==First Catt presidency==\n[[Carrie Chapman Catt]] joined the suffrage movement in Iowa in the mid-1880s. and soon became part of the leadership of the state suffrage association. Married to a wealthy engineer who encouraged her suffrage work, she was able to devote much of her energy to the movement. In 1895, she was placed in charge of NAWSA's Organizational Committee, where she raised money to put a team of fourteen organizers in the field. By 1899, suffrage organizations had been established in every state. When Anthony retired as NAWSA president in 1900, she arranged for Catt, who had not been closely associated with either the NWSA or the AWSA, to succeed her.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=7}}\nAnthony remained an influential figure in the organization, however, until she died in 1906.\n\n[[File:Carrie Chapman Catt - National Woman's Party Records.jpg|thumb|left|Carrie Chapman Catt]]\n\nOne of Catt's first actions as president was to implement the \"society plan,\" a campaign to recruit wealthy members of the rapidly growing [[women's club (United States)|women's club]] movement, whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. The list of organizations suggested as contacts for recruitment did not include the flourishing black women's club movement, implying a goal of attracting mostly white women.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=36\u201337}}\nPrimarily composed of middle-class women, the targeted clubs often engaged in civic improvement projects. They generally avoided controversial issues, but women's suffrage increasingly found acceptance among their membership.<ref>Stephen M. Buechler, ''The Transformation of the Woman Suffrage Movement: The Case of Illinois, 1850-1920'' (1986), pp. 154\u201357</ref> \nIn 1914, suffrage was endorsed by the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]], the national body for the club movement.{{sfnp|Dubois|1992|p=178}}\n\nTo make the suffrage movement more attractive to middle- and upper-class women, the NAWSA began to popularize a version of the movement's history that downplayed the earlier involvement of many of its members with such controversial issues as racial equality, divorce reform, working women's rights and critiques of organized religion. Stanton's role in the movement was obscured by this process, as were the roles of black and working women.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=43}}\nAnthony, who in her younger days was often treated as a dangerous fanatic, was given a grandmotherly image and honored as a \"suffrage saint.\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=47\u201348}}\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Women's Suffrage Parade, 1917 cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|Mural in U.S. Capitol  featuring NAWSA leaders [[Anna Howard Shaw]] and [[Carrie Chapman Catt]]]]\nThe reform energy of the [[Progressive Era]] strengthened the suffrage movement during this period. Beginning around 1900, this broad movement began at the grassroots level with such goals as combating corruption in government, eliminating child labor, and protecting workers and consumers. Many of its participants saw women's suffrage as yet another progressive goal, and they believed that the addition of women to the electorate would help the movement achieve its other goals.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA28 28\u201329]}}\n\nCatt resigned her position after four years, partly because of her husband's declining health and partly to help organize the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], which was created in Berlin in 1904 in coordination with the NAWSA and with Catt as president.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA231 231\u201332]}}\n\n==Shaw presidency==\nIn 1904, [[Anna Howard Shaw]], another Anthony prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was elected president of the NAWSA, serving more years in that office than any other person.

Although it had a frankly racist program, it asked for NAWSA's endorsement. Shaw refused, setting a limit on how far the organization was willing to go to accommodate southerners with overtly racist views. Shaw said the organization would not adopt policies that \"advocated the exclusion of any race or class from the right of suffrage.\"{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|p=109}}{{sfnp|Wheeler|1993|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kE6lZpmLmK0C&pg=PA120 120\u201321]}}\n\nIn 1907, partly in reaction to NAWSA's \"society plan\", which was designed to appeal to upper-class women, [[Harriet Stanton Blatch]], daughter of [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], formed a competing organization called the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=39, 82}}\nLater known as the Women's Political Union, its membership was based on working women, both professional and industrial. Blatch had recently returned to the United States after several years in England, where she had worked with suffrage groups in the early phases of employing militant tactics as part of their campaign. The Equality League gained a following by engaging in activities that many members of the NAWSA initially considered too daring, such as suffrage parades and open air rallies.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA242 242\u201346]}}\nBlatch said that when she joined the suffrage movement in the U.S., \"The only method suggested for furthering the cause was the slow process of education.

It had its origins in the College Equal Suffrage League, which was formed in Boston in 1900 at a time when there were relatively few college students in the NAWSA. It was established by [[Maud Wood Park]], who later helped create similar groups in 30 states. Park later became a prominent leader of the NAWSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444021/Maud-Wood-Park |title=Maud Wood Park |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>Jana Nidiffer, \"Suffrage, FPS, and History of Higher Education.\" in Allen, Elizabeth J., et al.

She and her co-workers developed a detailed plan to unite the various suffrage associations in New York City (and later in the entire state) in an organization modeled on political machines like [[Tammany Hall]]. In 1909, they founded the Woman Suffrage Party (WSP) at a convention attended by over a thousand delegates and alternates. By 1910, the WSP had 20,000 members and a four-room headquarters. Shaw was not entirely comfortable with the independent initiatives of the WSP, but Catt and other of its leaders remained loyal to the NAWSA, its parent organization.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nIn 1909, Frances Squires Potter, a NAWSA member from Chicago, proposed the creation of suffrage community centers called \"political settlements.\" Reminiscent of the social [[settlement movement|settlement houses]], such as [[Hull House]] in Chicago, their purpose was to educate the public about suffrage and the practical details of political activity at the local level. The political settlements established by the WSP included suffrage schools that provided training in public speaking to suffrage organizers.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nPublic sentiment toward the suffrage movement improved dramatically during this period. Working for suffrage came to be seen as a respectable activity for middle-class women. By 1910, NAWSA membership had jumped to 117,000.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=51\u201352}}\nThe NAWSA established its first permanent headquarters that year in New York City, previously having operated mainly out of the homes of its officers.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=241, 251}}\nMaud Wood Park, who had been away in Europe for two years, received a letter that year from one of her co-workers in the College Equal Suffrage League who described the new atmosphere by saying, \"the movement which when we got into it had about as much energy as a dying kitten, is now a big, virile, threatening thing\" and is \"actually fashionable now.\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=54}}\n\nThe change in public sentiment was reflected in efforts to win suffrage at the state level. In 1896, only four states, all of them in the West, allowed women to vote. From 1896 to 1910, there were six state campaigns for suffrage, and they all failed. The tide began to turn in 1910 when suffrage was won in the state of Washington, followed by California in 1911, Oregon, Kansas and Arizona in 1912, and others afterwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=One Woman, One Vote: Rediscovering the Woman Suffrage Movement |last=Wheeler |first=Marjorie Spruil|editor-last= Wheeler|editor-first= Marjorie Spruil|year=1995|chapter=Introduction: A Short History of the Woman Suffrage Movement in America |publisher=NewSage Press |location=Troutdale, Oregon |isbn=978-0939165261|pages=11, 14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ClfuAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Official Program Woman Suffrage Procession - March 3, 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Program for NAWSA's [[Woman suffrage parade of 1913|Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913]] in Washington]]\n\nIn 1912, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), publicly challenged NAWSA's reluctance to accept black women. The NAWSA responded in a cordial way, inviting him to speak at its next convention and publishing his speech as a pamphlet.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=138\u201339}}\nNonetheless the NAWSA continued to minimize the role of black suffragists. It accepted some black women as members and some black societies as auxiliaries, but its general practice was to turn such requests politely away.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=23\u201324}}\nThis was partly because attitudes of racial superiority were the norm among white Americans of that era, and partly because the NAWSA believed it had little hope of achieving a national amendment without at least some support from southern states that practiced [[racial segregation]].{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sZfmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 8, 81]}}\n\nNAWSA's strategy at that point was to gain suffrage for women on a state-by-state basis until it achieved a critical mass of voters that could push through a suffrage amendment at the national level.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|p=189}}\nIn 1913, the Southern States Woman Suffrage Committee was formed in an attempt to stop that process from moving past the state level. It was led by Kate Gordon, who had been the NAWSA's corresponding secretary from 1901 to 1909.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA298 298]}}\nGordon, who was from the southern state of Louisiana, supported women's suffrage, but opposed the idea of a federal suffrage amendment, charging that it would violate [[states' rights]]. She said that empowering federal authorities to enforce a constitutional right for women to vote in the South could lead to similar enforcement of the constitutional right of African Americans to vote there, a right that was being evaded, and, in her opinion, rightly so. Her committee was too small to seriously affect the NAWSA's direction, but her public condemnation of the proposed amendment, expressed in terms of vehement racism, deepened fissures within the organization.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=83, 118}}\n\n== Relocation to Warren, Ohio ==\nFor several years, [[Harriet Taylor Upton]] led the woman suffragist movement in [[Trumbull County, Ohio]].

Anthony, noted leader of the women's movement, visited Warren many times, including a 1904 trip to attend a national women's rights meeting here.\" <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Warren Played Big Role in Women's Suffragist Movement|last=|first=|date=August 26, 1975|work=The Tribune Chronicle|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nDuring this period, the nation's attention regarding women's rights was focused on Warren. The association's offices were located on the ground level of the Trumbull Court House, a building currently occupied by the Probate Court. While the headquarters left the Upton House around 1910, Warren remained active in the suffrage movement. The people of Warren were active in various programs of the national movement for years, until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] was ratified by a sufficient number of states, and authorized by [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] in 1920. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Warren Played Big Role in Women's Suffrage Movement|last=|first=|date=August 26, 1975|work=The Tribune Chronicle|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nIn 1993, the Upton House joined the list of historic landmarks. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Upton House to join list of historic landmarks|last=Johnson|first=Stephanie|date=January 23, 1993|work=The Tribune Chronicle|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Split in the movement==\nA serious challenge to the NAWSA leadership began to develop after a young activist named [[Alice Paul]] returned to the U.S. from England in 1910, where she had been part of the militant wing of the suffrage movement. She had been jailed there and had endured [[force-feeding|forced feedings]] after going on a hunger strike.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA256 255\u201357]}}\nJoining the NAWSA, she became the person most responsible for reviving interest within the suffrage movement for a national amendment, which for years had been overshadowed by campaigns for suffrage at the state level.<ref name=Gordon-in-Wheeler/>\n\n[[File:Alice Paul cph.3a38295.jpg|thumb|Alice Paul]]\n\nFrom Shaw's point of view, the time was right for a renewed emphasis on a suffrage amendment. Gordon and Clay, the most persistent adversaries of a federal suffrage amendment within NAWSA, had been out-maneuvered by their opponents and no longer held national posts.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=140, 142}}\nIn 1912, Alice Paul was appointed chair of NAWSA's Congressional Committee and charged with reviving the drive for a women's suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker [[Lucy Burns]] organized a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s inauguration as president. Onlookers who opposed the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order. Public outrage over the incident, which cost the chief of police his job, brought publicity to the movement and gave it fresh momentum.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA256 255\u201357]}}\n\nPaul troubled NAWSA leaders by arguing that because Democrats would not act to enfranchise women even though they controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress, the suffrage movement should work for the defeat of all Democrats regardless of an individual candidate's position on suffrage. NAWSA's policy was to follow the opposite approach, supporting any candidate who endorsed suffrage, regardless of political party.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA31 31]}}\nIn 1913, Paul and Burns formed the [[Congressional Union]] (CU) to work solely for a national amendment and sent organizers into states that already had NAWSA organizations. The relationship between the CU and the NAWSA became unclear and troubled over time.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA258 257\u201359]}}\n\nAt the NAWSA convention in 1913, Paul and her allies demanded that the organization focus its efforts on a federal suffrage amendment. The convention instead empowered the executive board to limit the CU's ability to contravene NAWSA policies. After negotiations failed to resolve their differences, the NAWSA removed Paul as head of its Congressional Committee. By February, 1914, the NAWSA and the CU had effectively separated into two independent organizations.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA258 257\u201359]}}\n\nBlatch merged her Women's Political Union into the CU.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|p=146}}\nThat organization in turn became the basis for the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), which Paul formed in 1916.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Woman's Crusade: Alice Paul and the Battle for the Ballot|last=Walton |first=Mary |year=2008 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-230-61175-7|pages=133, 158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAWbMy0IvkkC |accessdate=}}</ref>\nOnce again there were two competing national women's suffrage organizations, but the result this time was something like a division of labor. The NAWSA burnished its image of respectability and engaged in highly organized lobbying at both the national and state levels. The smaller NWP also engaged in lobbying but became increasingly known for activities that were dramatic and confrontational, most often in the national capital.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA32 32\u201333]}}\n\n==Second Catt presidency==\nDespite the rapid growth in NAWSA membership, discontent with Shaw grew. Her tendency to overreact to those who differed with her had the effect of increasing organizational friction.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=241}}\nSeveral members resigned from executive board in 1910, and the board saw significant changes in its composition every year after that through 1915.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA250 250]}}\n\n===1914\u201315===\n[[File:History of woman suffrage (1881) (14778322302).jpg|thumb|left|Helen Hamilton Gardener, Carrie Chapman Catt and Maud Wood Park (from left to right) on the balcony of Suffrage House, the Washington headquarters of the National American Woman Suffrage Association]]\n\nIn 1914, Senator [[John Shafroth]]<!--His first name was John per Van Voris p. 130 --> introduced a federal amendment that would require state legislatures to put women's suffrage on the state ballot if eight percent of the voters signed a petition to that effect. The NAWSA endorsed the proposed amendment, whereupon the CU accused it of abandoning the drive for a national suffrage amendment. Amid confusion among the membership, delegates at the 1914 convention directed their dissatisfaction at Shaw.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=156\u201357}}\nShaw had considered declining the presidency in 1914, but decided to run again. In 1915, she announced that she would not be running for reelection.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|pp=156, 162}}\n\nCatt was the obvious choice to replace her, but she was leading the New York State Woman Suffrage Party, which was in the early stages of a crucial suffrage campaign in that state.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=28\u201329}}\nThe prevailing belief in the NAWSA was that success in a large eastern state would be the tipping point for the national campaign.{{sfnp|Franzen|2014|p=142}}\nNew York was the largest state in the union, and victory there was a real possibility. Catt agreed to turn the New York work over to others and to accept the NAWSA presidency in December, 1915 on the condition that she could name her own executive board, which previously had always been elected by the annual convention. She appointed to the board women of independent means who could work for the movement full-time.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA266 265\u201367]}}\n\nBacked by an increased level of commitment and unity in the national office, Catt sent its officers into the field to assess the state of the organization and start the process of reorganizing it into a more centralized and efficient operation. Catt described the NAWSA as a camel with a hundred humps, each with a blind driver trying to lead the way. She provided a new sense of direction by sending out a stream of communications to state and local affiliates with policy directives, organizational initiatives and detailed plans of work.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA266 265\u201367]}}{{sfnp|Van Voris|1987|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&pg=PA131 131\u201332]}}\n\nThe NAWSA previously had devoted much of its effort to educating the public about suffrage, and it had made a significant impact. Women's suffrage had become a major national issue, and the NAWSA was in the process of becoming the nation's largest voluntary organization, with two million members.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|p=39}}\nCatt built on that foundation to convert the NAWSA into an organization that operated primarily as a political pressure group.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=83, 118}}\n\n===1916===\nAt an executive board meeting in March, 1916, Catt described the organization's dilemma by saying, \"The Congressional Union is drawing off from the National Association those women who feel it is possible to work for suffrage by the Federal route only. Certain workers in the south are being antagonized because the National is continuing to work for the Federal Amendment. The combination has produced a great muddle\".{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=267}}\nCatt believed that NAWSA's policy of working primarily on state-by-state campaigns was nearing its limits. Some states appeared unlikely ever to approve women's suffrage, in some cases because state laws made constitutional revision extremely difficult, and in others, especially in the Deep South, because opposition was simply too strong.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=143\u2013144}}\nCatt refocused the organization on a national suffrage amendment while continuing to conduct state campaigns where success was a realistic possibility.\n\nWhen the conventions of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views in a speech to the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nBoth party conventions endorsed women's suffrage but only at the state level, which meant that different states might implement it in different ways and in some cases not at all. Having expected more, Catt called an Emergency Convention, moving the date of the 1916 convention from December to September to begin organizing a renewed push for the federal amendment.{{sfnp|Van Voris|1987|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&pg=PA131 131\u201332]}}\nThe convention initiated a strategic shift by adopting Catt's \"Winning Plan\". This plan mandated work toward the national suffrage amendment as the priority for the entire organization and authorized the creation of a professional lobbying team to support this goal in Washington. It authorized the executive board to specify a plan of work toward this goal for each state and to take over that work if the state organization refused to comply. It agreed to fund state suffrage campaigns only if they met strict requirements that were designed to eliminate efforts with little chance of succeeding.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=87\u201390}}\nCatt's plan included milestones for achieving a women's suffrage amendment by 1922.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=274}}\nGordon, whose states' rights approach had been decisively defeated, exclaimed to a friend, \"A well-oiled steam roller has ironed this convention flat!\"{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=88}}\n\nPresident Wilson, whose attitude toward women's suffrage was evolving, spoke at the 1916 NAWSA convention.  He had been considered an opponent of suffrage when he was governor of New Jersey, but in 1915 he announced that he was traveling from the White House back to his home state to vote in favor of it in New Jersey's state referendum. He spoke favorably of suffrage at the NAWSA convention but stopped short of supporting the suffrage amendment.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=271\u2013272}}\n[[Charles Evans Hughes]], his opponent in the presidential election that year, declined to speak at the convention, but he went farther than Wilson by endorsing the suffrage amendment.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=187 endnote 25}}\n\n[[File:Gardener-Catt-1920.jpg|thumb|left|Carrie Chapman Catt (right) exiting the White House with Helen Hamilton Gardener]]\n\nNAWSA's Congressional Committee had been in disarray ever since Alice Paul was removed from it in 1913. Catt reorganized the committee and appointed Maud Wood Park as its head in December, 1916. Park and her lieutenant [[Helen Hamilton Gardener]] created what became known as the \"Front Door Lobby\", so named by a journalist because it operated openly, avoiding the traditional lobbying methods of \"backstairs\" dealing. A headquarters for the lobbying effort was established in a dilapidated mansion known as Suffrage House. NAWSA lobbyists lodged there and coordinated their activities with daily conferences in its meeting rooms.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nIn 1916 the NAWSA purchased the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'' from Alice Stone Blackwell. The newspaper had been established in 1870 by Blackwell's mother, Lucy Stone, and had served as the primary voice of the suffrage movement most of the time since then. It had significant limitations, however. It was a small operation, with Blackwell herself doing most of the work, and with much of its reporting centered on the eastern part of the country at a time when a national newspaper was needed.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=116\u2013117}}\nAfter the transfer, it was renamed ''Woman Citizen'' and merged with ''The Woman Voter'', the journal of the Woman Suffrage Party of New York City, and with ''National Suffrage News'', the former journal of the NAWSA.<ref name=leslie-com>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/naw:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbnawsan4830div12)) \"The record of the Leslie woman suffrage commission, inc., 1917\u20131929\", by Rose Young.]</ref> \nThe newspaper's masthead declared itself to be the NAWSA's official organ.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n===1917===\nIn 1917 Catt received a [[bequest]] of $900,000 from [[Miriam Leslie|Mrs. Frank (Miriam) Leslie]] to be used as she thought best for the women's suffrage movement. Catt allocated most of the funds to the NAWSA, with $400,000 applied toward upgrading the ''Woman Citizen''.{{sfnp|Fowler|1986|pp=118\u201319}}\n\nIn January 1917, Alice Paul's NWP began picketing the White House with banners that demanded women's suffrage. The police eventually arrested over 200 pickets, many of whom went on hunger strike after being imprisoned. The prison authorities [[force-feeding|force fed]] them, creating an uproar that fueled public debate on women's suffrage.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA275 275\u201379]}}\n\nWhen the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, the NAWSA cooperated with the war effort. Shaw was appointed as head of the Women's Committee for the [[Council of National Defense]], which was established by the federal government to coordinate resources for the war and to promote public morale. Catt and two other NAWSA members were appointed to its executive committee.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=103}}\nThe NWP, by contrast, took no part in the war effort and charged that the NAWSA did so at the expense of suffrage work.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA276 276, 377 endnote 16]}}\n\nIn April, 1917, [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana took her seat as the first woman in Congress, having previously served as lobbyist and field secretary for the NAWSA. Rankin voted against the declaration of war.{{sfnp|Van Voris|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s2SkL2HNuwEC&pg=PA139 139]}}\n\nIn November 1917, the suffrage movement achieved a major victory when a referendum to enfranchise women passed by a large margin in New York, the most populous state in the country.{{sfnp|Scott|Scott|1982|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=opBMJGm4jc8C&pg=PA41 41]}}\nThe powerful Tammany Hall political machine, which had previously opposed suffrage, took a neutral stance on this referendum, partly because the wives of several Tammany Hall leaders played prominent roles in the suffrage campaign.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=282}}\n\n===1918\u201319===\n\nThe House passed the suffrage amendment for the first time in January, 1918, but the Senate delayed its debate on the measure until September.

The Senate, however, defeated the measure by two votes.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA301 283, 300\u2013304]}}\nThe NAWSA launched a campaign to unseat four senators who had voted against the amendment, assembling a coalition of forces that included labor unions and prohibitionists. Two of those four senators were defeated in the federal elections in November.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=119\u2013122}}\n\nNAWSA held its Golden Jubilee Convention at the Statler Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri in March 1919. President Catt gave the opening address, in which she urged the delegates to create a league of women voters. A resolution was passed to form this league as a separate unit of NAWSA, with membership coming from states who allowed women to vote. The league was charged with achieving full suffrage and consideration of legislation that affected women in states where they were able to vote. On the last day of the convention, the Missouri senate passed legislation giving women the right to vote in presidential elections in Missouri and a resolution to submit a constitutional amendment for full suffrage. In June of that year, the Nineteenth Amendment was passed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Her Place: A Guide to St. Louis Women's History|last=Corbett|first=Katharine T.|publisher=Missouri History Museum|year=1999|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Passage of the Nineteenth Amendment===\nAfter the elections, Wilson called a special session of Congress, which passed the suffrage amendment on June 4, 1919.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|pp=307\u2013308}}\nThe struggle now passed to the state legislatures, three-fourths of which would need to ratify the amendment before it would become law.\n\nCatt and the NAWSA executive board had been planning their work in support of the ratification effort since April, 1918, over a year before Congress passed the amendment. Ratification committees had already been established in state capitals, each with its own budget and plan of work. Immediately after Congress passed the amendment, Suffrage House and the federal lobbying operation were shut down and resources were diverted to the ratification drive.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=129\u2013130}}\nCatt had a sense of urgency, expecting a slowdown in reform energy after the war, which had ended seven months earlier.

They had resigned from the NAWSA in the fall of 1918 at the executive board's request because of their public statements in opposition to a federal amendment.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|pp=118, 136, 142}}\nThe NAWSA allocated staff and other resources toward a campaign in the South to support the amendment's ratification. It was unable to organize a meaningful campaign there, however, and it basically abandoned hope that southern states would support ratification.{{sfnp|Graham|1996|p=130}}\nNonetheless, the legislature of the southern state of [[Tennessee]] ratified the amendment by one vote on August 18, 1920, providing the last state approval needed.{{sfnp|Flexner|1959|p=316}}\n\nThe [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], the women's suffrage amendment, became the law of the land on August 26, 1920, when it was certified by the [[United States Secretary of State]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/nineteenth.html |title=The Nineteenth Amendment|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Transition into the League of Women Voters===\nSix months before the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, the NAWSA held its last convention.

The series has been reprinted as a two-volume set, titled ''The Belgariad Volume One'', containing the first three books of the series, and ''The Belgariad Volume Two'', which contains the last two books. This does not include the original map by Chris Barbieri, but only Shelly Shapiro's map.\n\n''[[The Malloreon]]'' is a five-book [[sequel]] to the ''Belgariad''.

Aldur, one of the seven, fashions a stone orb and creates within it a \"living soul\". Torak, another of the seven, attempts to seize the Orb from Aldur and subdue the Orb's intelligence; the Orb mutilates the left side of Torak's body. The [[Orb of Aldur]] is later recovered by [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Protagonists|Belgarath]] the Sorcerer, King Cherek, and Cherek's sons. Riva, Cherek's youngest son, is found to be able to hold the Orb unharmed; he and his descendants protect the Orb from Torak.\n\nThe story then begins in earnest with the experiences of protagonist Garion. His childhood on a large, prosperous farm: his earliest memories in the kitchen of his Aunt Pol; his friend Durnik the blacksmith; early games and friends; and the [[Romance (love)|romance]] between Garion and local girl Zubrette. It also introduces Belgarath, as a wandering storyteller nicknamed 'Mister Wolf'; Garion's telepathic vision of the antagonist Asharak/Chamdar; and a \"dry voice\" in his mind, distinct from his own consciousness. The reader later discovers that this is the [[Human voice|Voice]] of [[Prophecy]], or \"Necessity\", which takes [[Action (philosophy)|action]] through him.\n\nWhen Belgarath, alias \"Wolf\", announces the [[theft]] of a mysterious object (actually the Orb), he, Garion, and Aunt Pol leave Faldor's farm to pursue the thief, reluctantly allowing Durnik to accompany them. They are joined later by Silk/Kheldar, a Drasnian [[prince]], [[Espionage|spy]], and [[Theft|thief]]; and by Barak, a Cherek [[Earl]]. Thereafter Mister Wolf follows an invisible trail through several regions until they are arrested.\n\nThey are taken to a meeting of monarchs where Garion suspects a green-cloaked individual of treason. A few days later, Barak and Garion are hunting [[wild boar]] when Garion notices the green-cloaked spy discussing further [[espionage]]; but before Garion can tell anyone of this, he is attacked by a wild boar, which is then slain by Barak in the form of a bear. Garion later exposes the green-cloaked spy, and the latter's patrons are defeated in a fight. Garion himself is almost captured, but escapes. \nGarion learns that Polgara is Belgarath's daughter and the sister of Garion's second-most-distant female ancestor (identified in the prologue as Queen Beldaran, wife of Riva), and for that reason called his aunt. Having learned this, Garion identifies Belgarath as his grandfather. The group, with the addition of an Algarian prince named Hettar, then leave in search of the Orb. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Queen of Sorcery ===\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Queen of Sorcery\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| image_size = 150px\n| caption = Queen of Sorcery cover\n| author = [[David Eddings]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = USA\n| language = English\n| series = The Belgariad\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher = Del Rey Books\n| release_date = November 1982\n| media_type = [[Hardcover]], [[Paperback]]\n| pages = 327 (paperback)\n| isbn = 0-345-32389-0\n| preceded_by = Pawn of Prophecy\n| followed_by = Magician's Gambit\n}}\n<!-- FAIR USE of Queen of Sorcery cover.jpg see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Queen of Sorcery cover.jpg for rationale -->\nThe story opens in the Kingdom of Arendia, where Garion duels and then befriends a master archer named Lelldorin. The party travel to Lelldorin's uncle's manor, where Garion hears about a plot to kill the Mimbrate king Korodullin and to start a civil war between the two grand duchies. The plot is masterminded by a spy from [[Cthol Murgos]] named Nachak. Garion's friends are joined thereafter by Korodullin's knight, Mandorallen.\n\nThe party continue to Vo Mimbre, the Arendish capital, where Garion reveals the plot to kill Korodullin, without naming its local conspirators, and Mandorallen challenges Nachak to a duel, which Hettar terminates by killing Nachak. The party travels to Tolnedra, to talk to the Emperor Ran Borune in the city of Tol Honeth, and are nearly captured by a group of mercenaries for the Queen of neighboring Nyissa. At Tol Honeth, Belgarath and Polgara urge the Emperor to rid Tolnedra of the invading 'Murgos'; but Ran Borune refuses. Upon leaving the capital, the group acquire an ineffectually-disguised Princess Ce'Nedra (Ran Borune's daughter), and enter the Wood of the Dryads, hoping to cross into Nyissa ahead of their opponent Zedar. In the Wood, Ce'Nedra asks the Dryad Queen Xantha for sanctuary, on grounds of common ancestry; but is refused. Splitting up on the way to the Nyissan capital of Sthiss Tor, they are detained by Tolnedran legionnaires under Grand Duke Kador of Tol Vordue, accompanied by Asharak, who demand Ce'Nedra to ensure Kador's chances of the throne. When Asharak slaps Polgara, Garion incinerates him, and Grand Duke Kador is taken prisoner by his soldiers.\n\nArriving at Nyissa by boat, Garion, angry at the treatment of the slaves there, uses the Will and the Word (the ability shared by himself with Belgarath, Polgara, and all other sorcerers in the story) to teleport one but does not know that the leeches in the river are poisonous so the slave dies. Following a quarrel with Polgara, Garion is kidnapped, drugged, and given as a gift to Queen Salmissra. He is rescued by Polgara and Barak (the latter again assuming a bear's shape); and Polgara, with permission by Issa, the god of the Nyissans, transforms Salmissra into an immortal snake. Thereafter Garion is reconciled with Polgara.\n\n=== Magician's Gambit ===\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Magician's Gambit\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| image_size = 150px\n| caption = Magician's Gambit cover\n| author = [[David Eddings]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = USA\n| language = English\n| series = The Belgariad\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher = Del Rey Books\n| release_date = June 1983\n| media_type = [[Hardcover]], [[Paperback]]\n| pages = 320 (paperback)\n| isbn = 0-345-32731-4\n| preceded_by = Queen of Sorcery\n| followed_by = Castle of Wizardry\n}}\n<!-- FAIR USE of ''Magician's Gambit'' cover.jpg see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Magician's Gambit cover.jpg for rationale --> \nIn the third book of the series, after learning that the [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Angaraks|Angarak]] sorcerer Ctuchik has stolen the Orb from its erstwhile thief Zedar, [[Belgarion]] and friends go after him, via the [[Vale of Aldur]]. In a sacred [[cave]], Garion brings a dead colt back to [[life]]. This is of significance because [[Polgara the Sorceress|Polgara]] and [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Belgarath]] maintained that before this, it was impossible to use the ''Will and the Word'' to restore life to the dead. To save time, the group passes through the haunted land of [[Maragor]], whose inhabitants were killed or enslaved when the [[Tolnedra]]ns invaded them to obtain [[gold]] and whose god Mara drove every invader insane. To protect their minds, Belgarath and Polgara place their companions in a trance, during which the voice of prophecy teaches Garion of its own purpose and his control of the Will and the Word. At the center of the ruins, Mara attempts to drive Ce'Nedra insane; but is prevented by the voice.\n\nIn the Vale of Aldur, Garion practices the Will and the Word, and learns from Belgarath. The group enters Ulgoland, and there recruit the local zealot Relg as a guide to [[Cthol Murgos]]. [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]] is left behind as a guest of Gorim, the Ulgos' supreme authority, when [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#UL|UL]] warns them against taking her to Cthol Murgos. At Cthol Murgos itself, Belgarath fights Ctuchik until Ctuchik attempts to [[annihilation|\"unmake\"]] the Orb and thus \"unmakes\" himself. The group escapes, taking the now unconscious Belgarath, a boy later nicknamed [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Eriond|Errand]], who carries the Orb unharmed, and an escaped slave named Taiba, descendant of the Marags sold into [[slavery]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Castle of Wizardry ===\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Castle of Wizardry\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| image_size = 150px\n| caption = Castle of Wizardry cover\n| author = [[David Eddings]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = USA\n| language = English\n| series = The Belgariad\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher = Del Rey Books\n| release_date = May 1984\n| media_type = [[Hardcover]], [[Paperback]]\n| pages = 416 (paperback)\n| isbn = 0-345-30080-7\n| preceded_by = Magician's Gambit\n| followed_by = Enchanters' End Game\n}}\n<!-- FAIR USE of Castle of Wizardry.jpg see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Castle of Wizardry.jpg for rationale --> \nThe role of leader is thrust upon Garion when [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Belgarath]] and Polgara are incapacitated: the former by his battle with Ctuchik and the latter by protecting Errand. Garion thereafter incapacitates the Hierarchs of Rak Cthol in retaliation for an attack upon Durnik. With Errand continuously trying to give the Orb of Aldur to one of the company (its donation being the source of his name), they return to Ulgo for Ce'Nedra and eventually reach the Isle of the Winds, the object of their journey.\n\nThere, [[Belgarion]] is led by Belgarath, Polgara, and the Voice of Prophecy to accept the Orb of Aldur from Errand in the Hall of the Rivan King, where the ancient Sword rests above the Rivan Throne. In Garion's hands, the Orb identifies him as the long-lost heir to the throne. This revelation infuriates [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]], who discovers herself betrothed to him. During the investiture, Garion, aided by the Voice of Prophecy, sees each member of the quest as an Instrument of Prophecy.\n\nShortly after the betrothal, Garion learns from the [[Mrin Codex|Mrin]] Prophecy that the Rivan King must slay the [[god]] Torak or die in the process. [[Belgarion]], [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Belgarath]], and Silk therefore set out to challenge [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Torak|Torak]], leaving only a note to Polgara and [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]] with instructions not to pursue them; whereupon Polgara enters a rage, which devastates her apartment and causes a thunderstorm overhead. Having learnt the reason of Belgarion's departure, Ce'Nedra raises an international army to distract the Angaraks from Garion's quest so that he may reach [[Cthol Mishrak]] safely and overcome Torak.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Enchanters' End Game ===\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Enchanters' End Game\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| image_size = 150px\n| caption = Enchanter's End Game cover\n| author = [[David Eddings]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = USA\n| language = English\n| series = The Belgariad\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher = Del Rey Books\n| release_date = December 1984\n| media_type = [[Hardcover]], [[Paperback]]\n| pages = 384 (paperback)\n| isbn = 0-345-30078-5\n| preceded_by = Castle of Wizardry\n| followed_by = [[The Malloreon]] (Guardians of the West)\n}}\n<!-- FAIR USE of Enchanter's End Game.jpg see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Enchanter's End Game.jpg for rationale -->\n\nThe final book of the series starts with [[Belgarion]], Silk, and Belgarath sneaking through [[Gar og Nadrak]], whence they cross into [[Mallorea]]. Garion is tempted by Torak to accept him as a father and Polgara as his mother, but rejects this offer and reaches [[Cthol Mishrak]] unchallenged.\n\nDespite a victory at Thull Mardu and the death of Taur Urgas, King of the Murgos, [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]], [[Polgara the Sorceress|Polgara]], [[Durnik]], and [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Eriond|Errand]] are captured by the emperor Zakath, who gives them to [[Zedar]]. ''En route'' Polgara reveals that the Mallorean Prophecies identify her as Torak's fianc\u00e9e, and that her resistance to Torak's call may decide Belgarion's duel. Zedar takes his prisoners to Torak's chamber, where Zedar kills Durnik, enraging Belgarath, who buries him alive. Torak attempts to sway Polgara; but Garion sends images of Durnik into her mind, thereby helping her to withstand Torak's call. A final battle ensues, during which Garion and Torak swell into immensity, and in which Garion, having mentally 'rejected' Torak again, kills him outright. The other gods confiscate Torak's body, and UL, the father of the gods, agrees to allow Garion to revive Durnik; Mara objects, but relents when Belgarath reveals the existence of Taiba.\n\nUpon the company's return to Riva, Garion and Ce'Nedra plan their wedding, while Polgara and Durnik are married in a private chapel in the Citadel. Here, Durnik reveals that he received the ''Will and the Word'' when he was brought back to life, and that Belgarath had been training him to control the \"will and the word\". Ce'Nedra and Garion are married, dance with everyone, and retire to their chambers. The story ends with a half-drunk Belgarath having a conversation with the Orb, while Garion and Ce'Nedra consummate their marriage.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters]]\n*[[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Races|Races in The Belgariad and The Malloreon]]\n*[[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Deities|Deities in The Belgariad and The Malloreon]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://kalten.sandwich.net/eddings/timeline.html A Timeline for the Belgariad and the Malloreon]\n* [http://kalten.sandwich.net/eddings/belgariad.html Glossary of Characters]\n* [http://mud.prophecy.lu/ A MUD set in the world of the Belgariad and the Malloreon]\n\n{{David_Eddings}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Belgariad, The}}\n[[Category:1980s fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:David Eddings sequences]]\n[[Category:High fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novel series]]\n[[Category:Pentalogies]]\n", "text_old": "{{lead too short|date=October 2013}}\n'''''The Belgariad''''' is a five-book [[fantasy]] epic written by [[David Eddings]], following the journey of protagonist Garion and his companions, first to recover a sacred stone, and later to use it against antagonist Torak.\n\n== Works in the series ==\n\nVolumes include:\n#''[[The Belgariad#Pawn of Prophecy|Pawn of Prophecy]]'' (1982)\n#''[[The Belgariad#Queen of Sorcery|Queen of Sorcery]]'' (1982)\n#''[[The Belgariad#Magician's Gambit|Magician's Gambit]]'' (1983)\n#''[[The Belgariad#Castle of Wizardry|Castle of Wizardry]]'' (1984)\n#''[[The Belgariad#Enchanters' End Game|Enchanters' End Game]]'' (1984)\n\nThe title of each book combines a [[chess]] term with a fantasy term; whereas the concept of a 'Game of Destiny' is a significant [[motif (literature)|motif]] in the story.

The party travel to Lelldorin's uncle's manor, where Garion hears about a plot to kill the Mimbrate king Korodullin and to start a civil war between the two grand duchies. The plot is masterminded by a spy from [[Cthol Murgos]] named Nachak. Garion's friends are joined thereafter by Korodullin's knight, Mandorallen.\n\nThe party continue to Vo Mimbre, the Arendish capital, where Garion reveals the plot to kill Korodullin, without naming its local conspirators, and Mandorallen challenges Nachak to a duel, which Hettar terminates by killing Nachak. The party travels to Tolnedra, to talk to the Emperor Ran Borune in the city of Tol Honeth, and are nearly captured by a group of mercenaries for the Queen of neighboring Nyissa. At Tol Honeth, Belgarath and Polgara urge the Emperor to rid Tolnedra of the invading 'Murgos'; but Ran Borune refuses. Upon leaving the capital, the group acquire an ineffectually-disguised Princess Ce'Nedra (Ran Borune's daughter), and enter the Wood of the Dryads, hoping to cross into Nyissa ahead of their opponent Zedar. In the Wood, Ce'Nedra asks the Dryad Queen Xantha for sanctuary, on grounds of common ancestry; but is refused. Splitting up on the way to the Nyissan capital of Sthiss Tor, they are detained by Tolnedran legionnaires under Grand Duke Kador of Tol Vordue, accompanied by Asharak, who demand Ce'Nedra to ensure Kador's chances of the throne. When Asharak slaps Polgara, Garion incinerates him, and Grand Duke Kador is taken prisoner by his soldiers.\n\nArriving at Nyissa by boat, Garion, angry at the treatment of the slaves there, uses the Will and the Word (the ability shared by himself with Belgarath, Polgara, and all other sorcerers in the story) to teleport one but does not know that the leeches in the river are poisonous so the slave dies. Following a quarrel with Polgara, Garion is kidnapped, drugged, and given as a gift to Queen Salmissra. He is rescued by Polgara and Barak (the latter again assuming a bear's shape); and Polgara, with permission by Issa, the god of the Nyissans, transforms Salmissra into an immortal snake. Thereafter Garion is reconciled with Polgara.\n\n=== Magician's Gambit ===\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Magician's Gambit\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| image_size = 150px\n| caption = Magician's Gambit cover\n| author = [[David Eddings]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = USA\n| language = English\n| series = The Belgariad\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher = Del Rey Books\n| release_date = June 1983\n| media_type = [[Hardcover]], [[Paperback]]\n| pages = 320 (paperback)\n| isbn = 0-345-32731-4\n| preceded_by = Queen of Sorcery\n| followed_by = Castle of Wizardry\n}}\n<!-- FAIR USE of ''Magician's Gambit'' cover.jpg see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Magician's Gambit cover.jpg for rationale --> \nIn the third book of the series, after learning that the [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Angaraks|Angarak]] sorcerer Ctuchik has stolen the Orb from its erstwhile thief Zedar, [[Belgarion]] and friends go after him, via the [[Vale of Aldur]]. In a sacred [[cave]], Garion brings a dead colt back to [[life]]. This is of significance because [[Polgara the Sorceress|Polgara]] and [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Belgarath]] maintained that before this, it was impossible to use the ''Will and the Word'' to restore life to the dead. To save time, the group passes through the haunted land of [[Maragor]], whose inhabitants were killed or enslaved when the [[Tolnedra]]ns invaded them to obtain [[gold]] and whose god Mara drove every invader insane. To protect their minds, Belgarath and Polgara place their companions in a trance, during which the voice of prophecy teaches Garion of its own purpose and his control of the Will and the Word. At the center of the ruins, Mara attempts to drive Ce'Nedra insane; but is prevented by the voice.\n\nIn the Vale of Aldur, Garion practices the Will and the Word, and learns from Belgarath. The group enters Ulgoland, and there recruit the local zealot Relg as a guide to [[Cthol Murgos]]. [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]] is left behind as a guest of Gorim, the Ulgos' supreme authority, when [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#UL|UL]] warns them against taking her to Cthol Murgos. At Cthol Murgos itself, Belgarath fights Ctuchik until Ctuchik attempts to [[annihilation|\"unmake\"]] the Orb and thus \"unmakes\" himself. The group escapes, taking the now unconscious Belgarath, a boy later nicknamed [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Eriond|Errand]], who carries the Orb unharmed, and an escaped slave named Taiba, descendant of the Marags sold into [[slavery]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Castle of Wizardry ===\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Castle of Wizardry\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| image_size = 150px\n| caption = Castle of Wizardry cover\n| author = [[David Eddings]]\n| illustrator = \n| cover_artist = \n| country = USA\n| language = English\n| series = The Belgariad\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]\n| publisher = Del Rey Books\n| release_date = May 1984\n| media_type = [[Hardcover]], [[Paperback]]\n| pages = 416 (paperback)\n| isbn = 0-345-30080-7\n| preceded_by = Magician's Gambit\n| followed_by = Enchanters' End Game\n}}\n<!-- FAIR USE of Castle of Wizardry.jpg see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Castle of Wizardry.jpg for rationale --> \nThe role of leader is thrust upon Garion when [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Belgarath]] and Polgara are incapacitated: the former by his battle with Ctuchik and the latter by protecting Errand. Garion thereafter incapacitates the Hierarchs of Rak Cthol in retaliation for an attack upon Durnik. With Errand continuously trying to give the Orb of Aldur to one of the company (its donation being the source of his name), they return to Ulgo for Ce'Nedra and eventually reach the Isle of the Winds, the object of their journey.\n\nThere, [[Belgarion]] is led by Belgarath, Polgara, and the Voice of Prophecy to accept the Orb of Aldur from Errand in the Hall of the Rivan King, where the ancient Sword rests above the Rivan Throne. In Garion's hands, the Orb identifies him as the long-lost heir to the throne. This revelation infuriates [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]], who discovers herself betrothed to him. During the investiture, Garion, aided by the Voice of Prophecy, sees each member of the quest as an Instrument of Prophecy.\n\nShortly after the betrothal, Garion learns from the [[Mrin Codex|Mrin]] Prophecy that the Rivan King must slay the [[god]] Torak or die in the process. [[Belgarion]], [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Belgarath]], and Silk therefore set out to challenge [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Torak|Torak]], leaving only a note to Polgara and [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]] with instructions not to pursue them; whereupon Polgara enters a rage, which devastates her apartment and causes a thunderstorm overhead.

Garion is tempted by Torak to accept him as a father and Polgara as his mother, but rejects this offer and reaches [[Cthol Mishrak]] unchallenged.\n\nDespite a victory at Thull Mardu and the death of Taur Urgas, King of the Murgos, [[Characters in The Belgariad and The Malloreon|Ce'Nedra]], [[Polgara the Sorceress|Polgara]], [[Durnik]], and [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Eriond|Errand]] are captured by the emperor Zakath, who gives them to [[Zedar]]. ''En route'' Polgara reveals that the Mallorean Prophecies identify her as Torak's fianc\u00e9e, and that her resistance to Torak's call may decide Belgarion's duel. Zedar takes his prisoners to Torak's chamber, where Zedar kills Durnik, enraging Belgarath, who buries him alive. Torak attempts to sway Polgara; but Garion sends images of Durnik into her mind, thereby helping her to withstand Torak's call. A final battle ensues, during which Garion and Torak swell into immensity, and in which Garion, having mentally 'rejected' Torak again, kills him outright. The other gods confiscate Torak's body, and UL, the father of the gods, agrees to allow Garion to revive Durnik; Mara objects, but relents when Belgarath reveals the existence of Taiba.\n\nUpon the company's return to Riva, Garion and Ce'Nedra plan their wedding, while Polgara and Durnik are married in a private chapel in the Citadel. Here, Durnik reveals that he received the ''Will and the Word'' when he was brought back to life, and that Belgarath had been training him to control the \"will and the word\". Ce'Nedra and Garion are married, dance with everyone, and retire to their chambers.

There are four independent four-point connectivities, and their sum coincides with <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle</math>.<ref name=\"dv11\"/> Other combinations of four-point connectivities are not known analytically. In particular they are not related to correlation functions of the minimal model,<ref name=\"dv10\"/> although they are related to the <math> q\\to 2</math> limit of spin correlators in the <math>q</math>-state Potts model.<ref name=\"dv11\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"dv10\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=On three-point connectivity in two-dimensional percolation | website=arXiv.org | date=2010-09-07 | doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/3/032001 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1314v1 | access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"dv11\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=Potts q-color field theory and scaling random cluster model | website=arXiv.org | date=2011-04-21 | doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2011.06.012 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4323v2 | access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cgl20\">{{cite web | last=Cheng | first=Miranda C.

Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means. We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with it. The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility and support the United Nations in establishing an early warning capability. </blockquote><blockquote>139. The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context, we are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We stress the need for the General Assembly to continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and its implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter and international law. We also intend to commit ourselves, as necessary and appropriate, to helping States build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and to assisting those which are under stress before crises and conflicts break out.</blockquote><blockquote>140. We fully support the mission of the Special Advisor of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide.</blockquote>\n\nThe above paragraphs in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document serve as the basis for the inter-governmental agreement to the Responsibility to Protect. The General Assembly adopted the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document in its resolution 60/1 of 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement|title=UN General Assembly Resolution 60/1 (16 September 2005)|last=|first=|date=24 October 2005|website=|publisher=UN|access-date=}}</ref> The body subsequently committed to continue consideration of the Responsibility to Protect with its Resolution A/Res/63/308 of October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/unresolutiona63l80rev1.pdf|title=Resolution of the General Assembly 63/308: The responsibility to protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=GCR2P|access-date=}}</ref> The UN Security Council first reaffirmed the Responsibility to Protect in Resolution 1674 (2006) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, recalling in particular paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Summit Outcome regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Scope and limitations of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe report of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]], which first articulated the Responsibility to Protect in its December 2001 Report, envisioned a wide scope of application in its articulation of the principle, which included \"overwhelming natural or environmental catastrophes, where the state concerned is either unwilling or unable to cope, or call for assistance, and significant loss of life is occurring or threatened.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHeads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit refined the scope of the Responsibility to Protect to the four crimes mentioned in paragraphs 138 and 139, namely genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which are commonly referred to as 'atrocity crimes' or 'mass atrocity crimes'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs per the Secretary-General's 2009 Report on the Responsibility to Protect, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect,'' \"The responsibility to protect applies, until Member States decide otherwise, only to the four specified crimes and violations: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity...To try to extend it to cover other calamities, such as HIV/AIDS, climate change or the response to natural disasters, would undermine the 2005 consensus and stretch the concept beyond recognition or operational utility.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/63/677|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe focused scope is part of what the UN Secretary-General has termed a \"narrow but deep approach\" to the Responsibility to Protect: A narrow application to four crimes, but a deep approach to response, employing the wide array of prevention and protection instruments available to Member States, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and civil society.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Three Pillars of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect consists of three important and mutually-reinforcing pillars, as articulated in the 2009 Report of the Secretary-General on the issue, and which build off of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and the intergovernmental agreement to the principle:\n# Pillar I: The protection responsibilities of the state;\n# Pillar II: International assistance and capacity-building;\n# Pillar III: Timely and decisive response.<ref name=\":3\" />\nAs seen in the 2005 World Outcome Document the UN Member States unanimously agreed to uphold their Responsibility to Protect. Pillar I being the protection responsibilities of the state, paragraph 138 (see definition) states \u201cEach individual state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity\u201d. Under Pillar I many countries are able to uphold these principles of preventing mass atrocity crimes. As Pillar II leads on to international assistance and capacity-building. The international community is sent to help populations in need before further crises break out. States who may be willing but are either incapable or too weak to uphold their responsibility now may receive international support as a result of R2P. Pillar III is to deliver a timely and decisive response. This movement is a prevention method for mass atrocity crimes when a state fails to protect its populations. In reference to paragraph 139 \u201cThe international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the [UN] Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/responsibility-to-protect-and-the-protection-of-civilians.html|title=The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 United Nations University|website=unu.edu|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UN Secretary-General's 2012 report, the three pillars of the Responsibility to Protect are not sequential and are of equal importance. \"Without all three, the concept would be incomplete. All three pillars must be implemented in a manner fully consistent with the purposes, principles, and provisions of the Charter''.''\"<ref name=\":2\" /> The pillared approach is intended to reinforce, not undermine state sovereignty. As per the 2009 report of the Secretary-General, \"By helping States to meet their core protection responsibilities, the responsibility to protect seeks to strengthen sovereignty, not weaken it. It seeks to help States to succeed, not just to react when they fail''.''\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== The Responsibility to Protect and 'Humanitarian Intervention' ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect differs from [[humanitarian intervention]] in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only be carried out as a measure of last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the UN Security Council.<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\">http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/libyaandr2poccasionalpaper-1.pdf</ref> This is in contrast to the principle of 'humanitarian intervention', which dubiously claims to allow for the use of force as a humanitarian imperative without the authorization of the Security Council.\n\nThe second point relates to the first. As a principle, the Responsibility to Protect is rooted firmly in existing international law, especially the law relating to sovereignty, peace and security, human rights, and armed conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/responsibility-protect-and-international-law|title=The Responsibility to Protect and International Law|work=brill.com}}</ref>\n\nThird, while humanitarian interventions have in the past been justified in the context of varying situations, R2P focuses only on the four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The first three crimes are clearly defined in international law and codified in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. Ethnic cleansing is not a crime defined under international law, but has been defined by the UN as \"a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas\".<ref>https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200247/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F1994%2F674 |date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nFinally, while humanitarian intervention assumes a \"right to intervene\", the R2P is based on a \"responsibility to protect\".<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\" /> Humanitarian intervention and the R2P both agree on the fact that sovereignty is not absolute. However, the R2P doctrine shifts away from state-centered motivations to the interests of victims by focusing not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk.<ref name=\"GSDRC 2013\">GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham</ref> In addition, it introduces a new way of looking at the essence of sovereignty, moving away from issues of \"control\" and emphasising \"responsibility\" to one's own citizens and the wider international community.<ref>Arbour, 2008; Evans, 2006\u20137</ref>\n\n== History of the Responsibility to Protect ==\n=== 1990s: Origins ===\nThe norm of the R2P was borne out of the international community's failure to respond to tragedies such as the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994 and the [[Srebrenica genocide]] in 1995.

In a radical reformulation of the meaning of state sovereignty, the report argued that sovereignty entailed not only rights but also responsibilities, specifically a state's responsibility to protect its people from major violations of human rights. This idea rested on earlier work by [[Francis Deng]] and Roberta Cohen regarding [[internally displaced person]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/03/25-internal-displacement-cohen|title=Reconciling Responsibility to Protect with IDP Protection|author=Roberta Cohen|date=25 March 2010|work=The Brookings Institution}}</ref> Inspiration may also be attributed to [[Jan Eliasson]], who in response to a questionnaire on internally displaced persons distributed by [[Francis Deng]], stated that assisting populations at risk within their own country was \"basically a question of striking a balance between sovereignty and solidarity with people in need.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mooney|first=Erin|year=2010|title=Something Old, Something New, Something Borrrowed...Something Blue?

(This does not mean that every measurement has to have been applied and been shown to fail, but that there are reasonable grounds to believe that only military action would work in that situation.)\n* Proportional means: The military means must not exceed what is necessary \"to secure the defined human protection objective\".\n* Reasonable prospects: The chance of success must be reasonably high, and it must be unlikely that the consequences of the military intervention would be worse than the consequences without the intervention.\n* Right authority: The military action has to have been authorized by the Security Council.\n\n=== 2005 World Summit Outcome Document ===\nAs the ICISS report was released in 2001, right around the time of the Second Gulf War, many thought that would be the end of this new norm. However, at the [[2005 World Summit]], where the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the UN convened, the R2P was unanimously adopted.<ref>http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf</ref> While the outcome was close to the ideas of the ICISS report, there were some notable differences: the R2P would now only apply to mass atrocity crimes (genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing), rather than human rights violations; no mention was made of the criteria of intervention (see above); and the UN Security Council was made the only body allowed to authorize intervention. The paragraphs also stress the importance of regional organizations and the role they can play through Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.\n\nThe results of this summit led to world leaders agreeing on holding each other accountable if they fail to uphold the new responsibilities. Decidedly if one state fails to uphold their responsibility this is now where State Sovereignty may be broken in order to protect people in danger of such crimes. First peaceful action is to be taken through humanitarian, diplomatic, or other means. If these fail to resolve the matter, the international community should come together in a \u201ctimely and decisive manner\u201d. This shall all be worked on a case-by-case basis through the UN Security Council as well as the UN Charter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Secretary-General's 2009 report ===\nOn 12 January 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] issued a report entitled [http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/implementing%20the%20rtop.pdf ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'']. The report was the first comprehensive document from the [[UN Secretariat]] on the R2P, following Ban's stated commitment to turn the concept into policy. The Secretary-General's report set the tone and the direction for the discussion on the subject at the UN. The report proposes three-pillar approach to the R2P:\n\n* Pillar One stresses that states have the primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n* Pillar Two addresses the international community's commitment to help states build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and to help those under stress before crises and conflicts break out.\n* Pillar Three focuses on the responsibility of [[international community]] to act in a timely and decisive way to prevent and halt genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when a state manifestly fails to protect its populations.\n\n=== Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (GCR2P) is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and [[advocacy]] for the Responsibility to protect. The Centre is based at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]], [[New York City]] with an office also located in [[Geneva]].<ref>[http://www.globalr2p.org/about_us About Us, Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]</ref>\n\n== United Nations ==\nAt the 2005 World Summit, UN member states included R2P in the Outcome Document agreeing to Paragraphs 138 and 139 as written in its Definition. These paragraphs gave final language to the scope of R2P. It applies to the four mass atrocities crimes only. It also identifies to whom the R2P protocol applies; i.e., nations first, and regional and international communities second. Since then, the UN has been actively engaged with the development of the R2P. Several resolutions, reports, and debates have emerged through the UN forum.\n\n=== Security Council ===\nThe Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to the R2P in more than 80 resolutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions and Presidential Statements Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> The first such resolution came in April 2006, when the Security Council reaffirmed the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 in [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1674(2006) Resolution 1674], formalizing their support for the R2P.

The informal interactive dialogue was held on 9 August 2010, with 49 member states, two regional organizations, and two civil society organizations speaking at the event. The discussion had a resoundingly positive tone, with virtually all of those that spoke stressing a need to prevent atrocities and agreeing that effective early warning is a necessary condition for effective prevention and early action.

The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide acts as a catalyst to raise awareness of the causes and dynamics of genocide, to alert relevant actors where there is a risk of genocide, and to advocate and mobilize for appropriate action. The mandates of the two Special Advisers are distinct but complementary. The efforts of their Office include alerting relevant actors to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity; enhancing the capacity of the UN to prevent these crimes, including their incitement; and working with member states, regional and sub-regional arrangements, and civil society to develop more effective means of response when they do occur.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth Special Advisers Deng and Luck ended their assignments with the Office in July 2012.

On 30 December 2007, [[Mwai Kibaki]] was declared the winner of the presidential elections and was sworn in as president a couple of hours later. The announcement of the results triggered widespread and systematic violence resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and the displacement of over 500,000 civilians. Clashes were characterized by the ethnically targeted killings of people aligned with the two major political parties, the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) and the [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] (PNU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-kenya|title=The Crisis in Kenya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nExternal intervention was almost immediate. French Foreign and European Affairs Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] made an appeal to the UN Security Council in January 2008 to react \"in the name of the responsibility to protect\" before Kenya plunged into a deadly ethnic conflict. On 31 December 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement expressing concern for the ongoing violence and calling for the population to remain calm and for Kenyan security forces to show restraint. On 10 January 2008, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was accepted by both the ODM and the PNU as the African Union Chief Mediator. Mediation efforts led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement on 28 February 2008. The agreement established Mwai Kibaki as President and [[Raila Odinga]] as Prime Minister, as well as the creation of three commissions: the [[Waki Commission|Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence]] (CIPEV); the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; and the [[Kriegler Commission|Independent Review Commission]] on the General Elections.

Deploring what it called \"the gross and systematic violation of human rights\" in strife-torn Libya, the Security Council demanded an end to the violence, \"recalling the Libyan authorities' responsibility to protect its population\", and imposed a series of international sanctions. The Council also decided to refer the situation to the [[International Criminal Court]].\n\nIn resolution 1973, adopted on 17 March 2011, the Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to ongoing attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute \"crimes against humanity\". The Council authorized member states to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory. A few days later, acting on the resolution, [[NATO]] planes started striking at Gaddafi's forces.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml|title=Background Information on the Responsibility to Protect \u2014 Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations|work=un.org}}</ref> NATO subsequently came under scrutiny for its behavior during the air strikes; concerns included the fact that the intervention quickly moved to [[regime-change]] and that there were allegations regarding aerial bombardments that may have caused civilian casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-libya#violence|title=Crisis in Libya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Central African Republic (CAR) 2013 ===\nIn December 2012, a loose rebel coalition named the [[S\u00e9l\u00e9ka]] initiated a military campaign to overthrow the government of the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR) and its then-president, [[Francois Boziz\u00e9]]. The S\u00e9l\u00e9ka, composed mostly of factions of armed groups in the northeast of the state, accused Boziz\u00e9's government of neglecting their region. They rapidly captured several strategic towns and were poised to take the capital city of [[Bangui]]. A hasty intervention by Chad and the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS) persuaded the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka to negotiate with Boziz\u00e9's government. The result, the Libreville Agreement of January 2013, installed a three-year power-sharing arrangement.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\">{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-the-central-african-republic|title=Crisis in CAR|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ECCAS failed to monitor the implementation of the Libreville Agreement and Boziz\u00e9 did not undertake any of the reforms necessary under the transition agreement. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka resurged and took control of Bangui and fifteen of CAR's sixteen provinces on 24 March 2013. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka's leader, [[Michel Djotodia]], proclaimed himself President, set up the National Transitional Council (NTC), and suspended CAR's constitution. A hurried ECCAS summit on 4 April 2013, which did not yet recognize Djotodia as President, called for the creation of a Transitional National Council (TNC), which would create a new constitution, conduct elections in eighteen months, and select an interim President. On 13 April, the TNC chose the sole candidate vying for interim president position, Michel Djotodia.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\" />\n\nFrom December 2012 onward, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces, who are predominantly Muslim, committed grave human rights abuses against civilians throughout the country and especially targeted the majority Christian population.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In response, Christian civilians formed \"[[anti-balaka]]\" (\"anti-machete\") militias, which have conducted vicious reprisals against Muslims. Extrajudicial killings of Muslim and Christian civilians have been carried out, including \"door to door\" searches by rival militias and mobs seeking potential victims.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/central_african_republic|title=Central African Republic: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|work=globalr2p.org}}</ref>\n\nThe situation in CAR rapidly deteriorated after 5 December 2013, after an attack in Bangui by anti-balaka militias and loyalists of ousted President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9. The attack against former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels sparked widespread violence throughout the capital as well as in Ouham province in the northwest. The violence marked a significant escalation of the conflict in CAR. Anti-balaka forces launched another attack against Muslim neighborhoods of Bangui on 20 December, spurring a cycle of renewed violence that led to at least 71 deaths by 24 December. A mass grave of at least 30 people who were reportedly executed and exhibited signs of torture was discovered on 25 December. The [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) estimates a further 40 civilians were killed on 25 December as violence continued between anti-balaka and ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces. Eight African Union (AU) peacekeepers were also killed between 25 and 26 December.<ref name=CARtimeline>http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/car-timeline-22-jan-14.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to OCHA, by September 2013 there were almost 400,000 internally displaced people and about 65,000 new refugees in neighbouring countries. Humanitarian agencies have alerted public opinion to the critical situation, stressing that 2.3 million CAR citizens (half the population) are in need of humanitarian assistance.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\">http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/B096-central-african-republic-better-late-than-never.pdf</ref>\n\n==== CAR and the R2P ====\nThe crisis in the CAR is a case for the R2P, due to mass atrocity crimes being committed by both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/12/18/central-african-republic-sectarian-atrocities-escalate|title=Central African Republic: Sectarian Atrocities Escalate \u2013 Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}</ref> During a Security Council briefing on 25 November, UN Deputy-Secretary-General [[Jan Eliasson]] said that the world faced \"a profoundly important test of international solidarity and of our responsibility to protect\" in CAR. The Security Council passed [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2127(2013) Resolution 2127] on 5 December, emphasizing that the NTC has the primary responsibility to protect the civilian population in CAR. The resolution granted a Chapter VII mandate to AU and French forces to protect civilians and restore security, imposed an arms embargo, and established a UN Commission of Inquiry.<ref name=CARtimeline />\n\nIn the beginning, the international response to the coup was purely diplomatic: members of the International Contact Group insisted that Michel Djotodia respect the principles set out in the Libreville agreement. The African Union was the first to react when it announced a new African-led International Support Mission for CAR ([[MISCA]]) in July 2013. However, MISCA has not been effective in reversing the deteriorating security situation. Although its mandate is well-defined, there is general agreement that it does not have the resources to fulfill its mission. The UN General Assembly put CAR on the international agenda in September. [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2121(2013) Resolution 2121], adopted on 10 October 2013 and sponsored by France, strengthened and broadened the mandate of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). Aware that MISCA alone is unable to adequately tackle the growing insecurity, France has changed its initial position from disengagement to military contribution, as announced by [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] on 20 November 2013, who said that French forces would be reinforced by almost 1,000 troops for a six-month period.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\" /> France began to deploy troops in CAR after receiving authorization from the Security Council on 5 December 2013 with Resolution 2127, which authorizes MISCA and French forces to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians and restore security in CAR. French soldiers immediately began to patrol in Bangui.<ref name=CARtimeline />\n\nOn 7 February 2014, it was reported that the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor [[Fatou Bensouda]] said that she had \"opened a preliminary investigation into possible war crimes in the Central African Republic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26089189|title=ICC opens CAR 'war crimes' preliminary investigation|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n=== Syria ===\nOver the last nine years, Syria has been in constant conflict. The war in Syria has directly killed 500,000 people, generated 5 million refugees, and internally displaced 7 million people. To help stop these atrocities the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), the UN, European Union, the League of Arab States, and other countries had agreed to meet to discuss the situation at stake. The conclusion was made that the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which increased the delivery of humanitarian aid, as well as a nationwide cessation of hostilities, was required in order to help those in need. The Commission on Inquiry, mandated by the Human Rights Council, has found the Syrian government while working with allied militias, has committed large-scale massacres, perpetrated war crimes and gross violations of international humanitarian law as a matter of state policy. The Commission of Inquiry's third report had stated that the government had committed crimes against humanity through extermination, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance, and other inhuman acts. Due to this statement, the UN Human Rights Council has adopted at least 16 different resolutions with regard to the atrocities taking place in Syria.  Despite all efforts and resolutions adopted to help uphold R2P, humanitarian aid has had limited success in reaching the affected populations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/|title=Populations at Risk: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Burundi ===\nThe country of Burundi is at grave risk for a possible civil war, if violence is not stopped. The civilians of Burundi face the serious and eminent risk of mass atrocities due to the ongoing political violence that threatens the stability of Burundi.  The citizens of Burundi are being harmed through mass atrocity crimes due to targeted killings, widespread violations and abuses of human rights. Violence had increased after President Pierre Nkurnziza had announced he was seeking a third term in the country\u2019s elections, and instructing his citizens to disarm or face action by Burundian Security forces and be labeled enemies of the nation. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports cases of sexual violence by security forces, hate speech, and incitement to violence by some government officials. Responses by the international community include a Security Council-mandated police force with the goal of monitoring the situation. This police force has been rejected by Burundi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/burundi|title=Burundi|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Yemen Crisis===\nWith the current armed conflict in Yemen, many civilians are facing mass atrocity crimes. These crimes are a result of the violence between pro-government forces and regional military as they fight against the Houthi rebels. The Houthi rebels and pro-Saleh personnel currently control a majority of Yemen, including the country's capital, Sana\u2019a. In addition to the violence between these groups the nation has also been barraged by Saudi-led airstrikes for years.

On the second point, Bellamy finds that R2P language is used in UNSC deliberations and in the rhetoric of world leaders.\n\nInternational relations professor Amitai Etzioni notes R2P challenges the Westphalian norm that state sovereignty is \u201cabsolute.\u201d R2P establishes \u201cconditional\u201d state sovereignty contingent upon fulfilling certain domestic and international obligations. Etzioni considers the R2P norm of conditional sovereignty a communitarian approach as it recognizes states have the right to self-determination and self-governance, but they also have a responsibility to the international community to protect the environment, promote peace, and not harm their state\u2019s inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite article|title=Defining Down Sovereignty: The Rights and Responsibilities of Nations|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|year=2016|ssrn = 2741719}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism of R2P ==\nR2P and certain implementations of it have come under criticism by some states and individuals.\n\n=== Infringement of national sovereignty ===\nOne of the main concerns surrounding R2P is that it infringes upon national sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Moran\n  | first1 = Rick\n  | last2 =  Horowitz\n  | first2 = David, editor\n  | authorlink1 = \n  | authorlink2 = David Horowitz\n  | title = Libya and the Soros Doctrine\n  | journal = FrontPage Magazine\n  | date = March 28, 2011\n  | url = http://frontpagemag.com/2011/03/28/libya-and-the-soros-doctrine/\n  | accessdate = January 7, 2012}}</ref> This concern is rebutted by the Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in the report ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect''. According to the first pillar of R2P, the state has the responsibility to protect its populations from mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing, and according to the second pillar the international community has the responsibility to help states fulfill their responsibility. Advocates of R2P claim that the only occasions where the international community will intervene in a state without its consent is when the state is either allowing mass atrocities to occur, or is committing them, in which case the state is no longer upholding its responsibilities as a sovereign. In this sense, R2P can be understood as reinforcing sovereignty.<ref>Ban Ki-moon, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'', p. 7-8</ref> In 2004, the [[High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]], set up by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, endorsed the emerging norm of R2P, stating that there is a collective international responsibility \"...exercisable by the Security Council authorizing military intervention as a last resort, in the event of genocide and other large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing, and serious violations of humanitarian law which sovereign governments have proved powerless or unwilling to prevent.\"<ref name=\"un.org\" />\n\n=== Libya, 2011 ===\nOn March 19, 2011, the Security Council approved [[Resolution 1973]], which reiterated the responsibility of the Libyan authorities to protect the Libyan population.

While the doctrine was initially invoked to protect against government reprisals in rebel-held Benghazi, the resulting operation grew in scope to support the total overthrow of the government.

These were vetoed by Russia and China. The Russian and Chinese governments both issued statements to the effect that, in their opinion, R2P had been abused by the U.S. as a pretext for \"regime change\", more particularly in the case of Libya, and that as far as they were concerned they would be extremely suspicious of any future Security Council resolutions invoking R2P, based on past experience. According to the UN's own 4 October 2011 coverage of the meeting of the Security Council:\n\n<blockquote>[Russia's UN Ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]]] was alarmed that compliance with Security Council resolutions in Libya had been considered a model for future actions by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was important to see how that model had been implemented. The demand for a ceasefire had turned into a civil war, the humanitarian, social and military consequences of which had spilled beyond Libya. The arms embargo had turned into a naval blockade on west Libya. Such models should be excluded from global practice.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[\u2026] [China's UN Ambassador [[Li Baodong]]] hoped that the [Syrian] Government would follow through on reform and a process of dialogue. The Council should encourage those objectives while respecting Syria's sovereignty's [sic] and territorial integrity.

However, states will often be wary to engage in humanitarian intervention unless the intervention is partly rooted in self-interest. The appearance that the intervention is not strictly altruistic consequently leads some to question its legitimacy.\n* '''The counterfactual problem''' \u2013 When R2P is successful, there will not be any clear-cut evidence of its success: a mass atrocity that did not occur but would have occurred without intervention. Defenders of R2P consequently have to rely on counterfactual arguments.\n* '''The conspicuous harm problem''' \u2013 While the benefits of the intervention will not be clearly visible, the destructiveness and costs of the intervention will be visible. This makes it more difficult for proponents of the intervention to defend the intervention. The destruction caused by the intervention also makes some question the legitimacy of the intervention due to the stated purpose of preventing harm.\n* '''The end-state problem''' \u2013 Humanitarian intervention is prone to expand the mission beyond simply averting mass atrocities. When successful at averting mass atrocities, the intervenors will often be forced to take upon themselves more expansive mandates to ensure that threatened populations will be safe after the intervenors leave.\n* '''The inconsistency problem''' \u2013 Due to the aforementioned problems, in addition to the belief that a particular military action is likely to cause more harm than good, states may fail to act in situations where mass atrocities loom. The failure to intervene in any and all situations where there is a risk of mass atrocities lead to charges of inconsistency.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sovereignty]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Human security]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n* [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[International Criminal Court]]\n* [[Rwandan genocide]]\n* [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica Genocide]]\n* [[Peacekeeping]]\n* [[Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Orford, Anne.

Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means. We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with it. The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility and support the United Nations in establishing an early warning capability. </blockquote><blockquote>139. The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context, we are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We stress the need for the General Assembly to continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and its implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter and international law. We also intend to commit ourselves, as necessary and appropriate, to helping States build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and to assisting those which are under stress before crises and conflicts break out.</blockquote><blockquote>140. We fully support the mission of the Special Advisor of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide.</blockquote>\n\nThe above paragraphs in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document serve as the basis for the inter-governmental agreement to the Responsibility to Protect. The General Assembly adopted the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document in its resolution 60/1 of 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/487/60/PDF/N0548760.pdf?OpenElement|title=UN General Assembly Resolution 60/1 (16 September 2005)|last=|first=|date=24 October 2005|website=|publisher=UN|access-date=}}</ref> The body subsequently committed to continue consideration of the Responsibility to Protect with its Resolution A/Res/63/308 of October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/unresolutiona63l80rev1.pdf|title=Resolution of the General Assembly 63/308: The responsibility to protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=GCR2P|access-date=}}</ref> The UN Security Council first reaffirmed the Responsibility to Protect in Resolution 1674 (2006) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, recalling in particular paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Summit Outcome regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Scope and limitations of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe report of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]], which first articulated the Responsibility to Protect in its December 2001 Report, envisioned a wide scope of application in its articulation of the principle, which included \"overwhelming natural or environmental catastrophes, where the state concerned is either unwilling or unable to cope, or call for assistance, and significant loss of life is occurring or threatened.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHeads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit refined the scope of the Responsibility to Protect to the four crimes mentioned in paragraphs 138 and 139, namely genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which are commonly referred to as 'atrocity crimes' or 'mass atrocity crimes'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs per the Secretary-General's 2009 Report on the Responsibility to Protect, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect,'' \"The responsibility to protect applies, until Member States decide otherwise, only to the four specified crimes and violations: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity...To try to extend it to cover other calamities, such as HIV/AIDS, climate change or the response to natural disasters, would undermine the 2005 consensus and stretch the concept beyond recognition or operational utility.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/63/677|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe focused scope is part of what the UN Secretary-General has termed a \"narrow but deep approach\" to the Responsibility to Protect: A narrow application to four crimes, but a deep approach to response, employing the wide array of prevention and protection instruments available to Member States, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and civil society.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Three Pillars of the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect consists of three important and mutually-reinforcing pillars, as articulated in the 2009 Report of the Secretary-General on the issue, and which build off of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and the intergovernmental agreement to the principle:\n# Pillar I: The protection responsibilities of the state;\n# Pillar II: International assistance and capacity-building;\n# Pillar III: Timely and decisive response.<ref name=\":3\" />\nAs seen in the 2005 World Outcome Document the UN Member States unanimously agreed to uphold their Responsibility to Protect. Pillar I being the protection responsibilities of the state, paragraph 138 (see definition) states \u201cEach individual state has the responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity\u201d. Under Pillar I many countries are able to uphold these principles of preventing mass atrocity crimes. As Pillar II leads on to international assistance and capacity-building. The international community is sent to help populations in need before further crises break out. States who may be willing but are either incapable or too weak to uphold their responsibility now may receive international support as a result of R2P. Pillar III is to deliver a timely and decisive response. This movement is a prevention method for mass atrocity crimes when a state fails to protect its populations. In reference to paragraph 139 \u201cThe international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the [UN] Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/responsibility-to-protect-and-the-protection-of-civilians.html|title=The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 United Nations University|website=unu.edu|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the UN Secretary-General's 2012 report, the three pillars of the Responsibility to Protect are not sequential and are of equal importance. \"Without all three, the concept would be incomplete. All three pillars must be implemented in a manner fully consistent with the purposes, principles, and provisions of the Charter''.''\"<ref name=\":2\" /> The pillared approach is intended to reinforce, not undermine state sovereignty. As per the 2009 report of the Secretary-General, \"By helping States to meet their core protection responsibilities, the responsibility to protect seeks to strengthen sovereignty, not weaken it. It seeks to help States to succeed, not just to react when they fail''.''\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== The Responsibility to Protect and 'Humanitarian Intervention' ===\nThe Responsibility to Protect differs from [[humanitarian intervention]] in four important ways. First, humanitarian intervention only refers to the use of military force, whereas R2P is first and foremost a preventive principle that emphasizes a range of measures to stem the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity before the crimes are threatened or occur. The use of force may only be carried out as a measure of last resort, when all other non-coercive measures have failed, and only when it is authorized by the UN Security Council.<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\">http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/libyaandr2poccasionalpaper-1.pdf</ref> This is in contrast to the principle of 'humanitarian intervention', which dubiously claims to allow for the use of force as a humanitarian imperative without the authorization of the Security Council.\n\nThe second point relates to the first. As a principle, the Responsibility to Protect is rooted firmly in existing international law, especially the law relating to sovereignty, peace and security, human rights, and armed conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/responsibility-protect-and-international-law|title=The Responsibility to Protect and International Law|work=brill.com}}</ref>\n\nThird, while humanitarian interventions have in the past been justified in the context of varying situations, R2P focuses only on the four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The first three crimes are clearly defined in international law and codified in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]], the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. Ethnic cleansing is not a crime defined under international law, but has been defined by the UN as \"a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas\".<ref>https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514200247/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S%2F1994%2F674 |date=2011-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nFinally, while humanitarian intervention assumes a \"right to intervene\", the R2P is based on a \"responsibility to protect\".<ref name=\"globalr2p.org\" /> Humanitarian intervention and the R2P both agree on the fact that sovereignty is not absolute. However, the R2P doctrine shifts away from state-centered motivations to the interests of victims by focusing not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk.<ref name=\"GSDRC 2013\">GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide.

[[Kofi Annan]], who was Assistant Secretary-General at the UN Department for Peacekeeping Operations during the Rwandan genocide,<ref>http://www.biography.com/people/kofi-annan-9185694</ref> realized the international community's failure to respond. In the wake of the Kosovo intervention, 1999, Annan insisted that traditional notions of sovereignty had been redefined: \u201cStates are now widely understood to be instruments at the service of their peoples\u201d,<ref>\nK. Annan, Two Concepts of Sovereignty, ECONOMIST, Sept. 18, 1999, at 49, 49; http://www.economist.com/node/324795\n</ref> he said, while  U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] cited human rights concerns in 46% of the hundreds of remarks that he made justifying intervention in Kosovo.<ref>N.Kerton-Johnson, JUSTIFYING AMERICA\u2019S WARS: THE CONDUCT AND PRACTICE OF US MILITARY INTERVENTION 63\u201364 (2011).</ref>\nIn 2000, and in his capacity as [[UN Secretary-General]], Annan wrote the report \"We the Peoples\" on the role of the United Nations in the 21st Century, and in this report he posed the following question: \"if [[humanitarian intervention]] is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica \u2013 to gross and systematic violations of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?\"<ref>http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan000923.pdf</ref>\n\n=== 2000: African Union proposes a right to intervene ===\nMany critics of the R2P's third pillar claim that R2P is a Western concept, but it was the [[African Union]] (AU) that pioneered the concept that the international community has a responsibility to intervene in crisis situations if a state is failing to protect its population from mass atrocity crimes.<ref>http://www.nai.uu.se/publications/series/notes/978-91-7106-642-8.pdf</ref> In 2000, the AU incorporated the right to intervene in a member state, as enshrined in Article 4(h) of its [[Constitutive Act of the African Union|Constitutive Act]], which declares \"[t]he right of the Union to intervene in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity\".<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Constitutive Acts of the African Union\n |work        = Documents and speeches\n |publisher   = African Union Summit, South Africa 2002\n |url         = http://www.au2002.gov.za/docs/key_oau/au_act.htm\n |accessdate  = 2012-01-07\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120106025116/http://www.au2002.gov.za/docs/key_oau/au_act.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-01-06\n}}</ref> The AU also adopted the [[Ezulwini Consensus]] in 2005, which welcomed R2P as a tool for the prevention of mass atrocities.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = The common African position on the proposed reform of the United Nations: \"The Ezulwini Consensus\"\n  | work = Executive Council, 7th Extraordinary Session, March 7,8, 2005 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Ext/EX.CL/2 (VII)\n  | publisher = African Union\n  | url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:knfeO7BmdKYJ:www.africa-union.org/News_Events/Calendar_of_%2520Events/7th%2520extra%2520ordinary%2520session%2520ECL/Ext%2520EXCL2%2520VII%2520Report.doc+ezulwini+consensus&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari&redir_esc=&ei=BhwIT5CWG47jggeE9MWPAg\n  | accessdate = 2012-01-07}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000: International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty ===\nIn September 2000, following an appeal by its Foreign Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]], the Canadian government established the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) to answer Annan's question \"if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]], to a [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica]] \u2013 to gross and systematic violations of human rights that affect every precept of our common humanity?\" In February 2001, at the third round table meeting of the ICISS in London, [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]], [[Mohamed Sahnoun]], and [[Michael Ignatieff]] suggested the phrase \"responsibility to protect\" as a way to avoid the \"right to intervene\" or \"obligation to intervene\" doctrines and yet keep a degree of duty to act to resolve humanitarian crises.<ref name=\"Haines\">{{Citation\n  | last2 = Kassimeris\n  | first2 = George, ed.\n  | last1 = Haines\n  | first1 = Steven\n  | title = The Ashgate research companion to modern warfare\n  | place = Burlington, VT\n  | publisher = Ashgate Publishing Ltd\n  | year = 2010\n  | chapter = Chapter 18, Humanitarian Intervention: Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and the Use of Force\n  | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxWaFyEE0QC&pg=PA307&dq=%22Humanitarian+Intervention:+Genocide,+Crimes+against+Humanity+and+the+Use+of+Force%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U18OT5L-Gq230gGF9IG-Aw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Humanitarian%20Intervention%3A%20Genocide%2C%20Crimes%20against%20Humanity%20and%20the%20Use%20of%20Force%22&f=false\n  | pages = 307\u2013329\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxWaFyEE0QC\n  | isbn = 978-0-7546-7410-8\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, ICISS released a report titled [http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/ICISS%20Report.pdf \"The Responsibility to Protect\"]. In a radical reformulation of the meaning of state sovereignty, the report argued that sovereignty entailed not only rights but also responsibilities, specifically a state's responsibility to protect its people from major violations of human rights. This idea rested on earlier work by [[Francis Deng]] and Roberta Cohen regarding [[internally displaced person]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2010/03/25-internal-displacement-cohen|title=Reconciling Responsibility to Protect with IDP Protection|author=Roberta Cohen|date=25 March 2010|work=The Brookings Institution}}</ref> Inspiration may also be attributed to [[Jan Eliasson]], who in response to a questionnaire on internally displaced persons distributed by [[Francis Deng]], stated that assisting populations at risk within their own country was \"basically a question of striking a balance between sovereignty and solidarity with people in need.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mooney|first=Erin|year=2010|title=Something Old, Something New, Something Borrrowed...Something Blue?

(This does not mean that every measurement has to have been applied and been shown to fail, but that there are reasonable grounds to believe that only military action would work in that situation.)\n* Proportional means: The military means must not exceed what is necessary \"to secure the defined human protection objective\".\n* Reasonable prospects: The chance of success must be reasonably high, and it must be unlikely that the consequences of the military intervention would be worse than the consequences without the intervention.\n* Right authority: The military action has to have been authorized by the Security Council.\n\n=== 2005 World Summit Outcome Document ===\nAs the ICISS report was released in 2001, right around the time of the Second Gulf War, many thought that would be the end of this new norm. However, at the [[2005 World Summit]], where the largest number of heads of state and government in the history of the UN convened, the R2P was unanimously adopted.<ref>http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf</ref> While the outcome was close to the ideas of the ICISS report, there were some notable differences: the R2P would now only apply to mass atrocity crimes (genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing), rather than human rights violations; no mention was made of the criteria of intervention (see above); and the UN Security Council was made the only body allowed to authorize intervention. The paragraphs also stress the importance of regional organizations and the role they can play through Chapter VIII of the UN Charter.\n\nThe results of this summit led to world leaders agreeing on holding each other accountable if they fail to uphold the new responsibilities. Decidedly if one state fails to uphold their responsibility this is now where State Sovereignty may be broken in order to protect people in danger of such crimes. First peaceful action is to be taken through humanitarian, diplomatic, or other means. If these fail to resolve the matter, the international community should come together in a \u201ctimely and decisive manner\u201d. This shall all be worked on a case-by-case basis through the UN Security Council as well as the UN Charter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/pdf/Backgrounder%20R2P%202014.pdf|title=The Responsibility to Protect|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Secretary-General's 2009 report ===\nOn 12 January 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] issued a report entitled [http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/implementing%20the%20rtop.pdf ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'']. The report was the first comprehensive document from the [[UN Secretariat]] on the R2P, following Ban's stated commitment to turn the concept into policy. The Secretary-General's report set the tone and the direction for the discussion on the subject at the UN. The report proposes three-pillar approach to the R2P:\n\n* Pillar One stresses that states have the primary responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n* Pillar Two addresses the international community's commitment to help states build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and to help those under stress before crises and conflicts break out.\n* Pillar Three focuses on the responsibility of [[international community]] to act in a timely and decisive way to prevent and halt genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when a state manifestly fails to protect its populations.\n\n=== Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect ===\nThe Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (GCR2P) is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that conducts research and [[advocacy]] for the Responsibility to protect. The Centre is based at the [[Graduate Center, CUNY]], [[New York City]] with an office also located in [[Geneva]].<ref>[http://www.globalr2p.org/about_us About Us, Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]</ref>\n\n== United Nations ==\nAt the 2005 World Summit, UN member states included R2P in the Outcome Document agreeing to Paragraphs 138 and 139 as written in its Definition. These paragraphs gave final language to the scope of R2P. It applies to the four mass atrocities crimes only. It also identifies to whom the R2P protocol applies; i.e., nations first, and regional and international communities second. Since then, the UN has been actively engaged with the development of the R2P. Several resolutions, reports, and debates have emerged through the UN forum.\n\n=== Security Council ===\nThe Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to the R2P in more than 80 resolutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/resources/335|title=UN Security Council Resolutions and Presidential Statements Referencing R2P: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> The first such resolution came in April 2006, when the Security Council reaffirmed the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 in [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1674(2006) Resolution 1674], formalizing their support for the R2P.

The mandates of the two Special Advisers are distinct but complementary. The efforts of their Office include alerting relevant actors to the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity; enhancing the capacity of the UN to prevent these crimes, including their incitement; and working with member states, regional and sub-regional arrangements, and civil society to develop more effective means of response when they do occur.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth Special Advisers Deng and Luck ended their assignments with the Office in July 2012.

Clashes were characterized by the ethnically targeted killings of people aligned with the two major political parties, the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) and the [[Party of National Unity (Kenya)|Party of National Unity]] (PNU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-kenya|title=The Crisis in Kenya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nExternal intervention was almost immediate. French Foreign and European Affairs Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] made an appeal to the UN Security Council in January 2008 to react \"in the name of the responsibility to protect\" before Kenya plunged into a deadly ethnic conflict. On 31 December 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement expressing concern for the ongoing violence and calling for the population to remain calm and for Kenyan security forces to show restraint. On 10 January 2008, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was accepted by both the ODM and the PNU as the African Union Chief Mediator. Mediation efforts led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement on 28 February 2008. The agreement established Mwai Kibaki as President and [[Raila Odinga]] as Prime Minister, as well as the creation of three commissions: the [[Waki Commission|Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence]] (CIPEV); the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; and the [[Kriegler Commission|Independent Review Commission]] on the General Elections. This rapid and coordinated reaction by the international community was praised by [[Human Rights Watch]] as \"a model of diplomatic action under the 'Responsibility to Protect' principles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/kenya0308/10.htm|title=Ballots to Bullets: Organized Political Violence and Kenya's Crisis of Governance: The Response of International Actors|work=hrw.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Ivory Coast 2011 ===\nOn 30 March 2011, in response to the escalating post-election violence against the population of [[Ivory Coast]] in late 2010 and early 2011, the Security Council unanimously adopted [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1975(2011) resolution 1975] condemning the gross human rights violations committed by supporters of both ex-President Laurent Gbagbo and President Ouattara.

Following widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population by the Libyan regime, and language used by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] that reminded the international community of the genocide in Rwanda, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1970 on 26 February 2011, making explicit reference to the R2P. Deploring what it called \"the gross and systematic violation of human rights\" in strife-torn Libya, the Security Council demanded an end to the violence, \"recalling the Libyan authorities' responsibility to protect its population\", and imposed a series of international sanctions. The Council also decided to refer the situation to the [[International Criminal Court]].\n\nIn resolution 1973, adopted on 17 March 2011, the Security Council demanded an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including an end to ongoing attacks against civilians, which it said might constitute \"crimes against humanity\". The Council authorized member states to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory. A few days later, acting on the resolution, [[NATO]] planes started striking at Gaddafi's forces.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml|title=Background Information on the Responsibility to Protect \u2014 Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations|work=un.org}}</ref> NATO subsequently came under scrutiny for its behavior during the air strikes; concerns included the fact that the intervention quickly moved to [[regime-change]] and that there were allegations regarding aerial bombardments that may have caused civilian casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-libya#violence|title=Crisis in Libya|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Central African Republic (CAR) 2013 ===\nIn December 2012, a loose rebel coalition named the [[S\u00e9l\u00e9ka]] initiated a military campaign to overthrow the government of the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR) and its then-president, [[Francois Boziz\u00e9]]. The S\u00e9l\u00e9ka, composed mostly of factions of armed groups in the northeast of the state, accused Boziz\u00e9's government of neglecting their region. They rapidly captured several strategic towns and were poised to take the capital city of [[Bangui]]. A hasty intervention by Chad and the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS) persuaded the S\u00e9l\u00e9ka to negotiate with Boziz\u00e9's government. The result, the Libreville Agreement of January 2013, installed a three-year power-sharing arrangement.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\">{{cite web|url=http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php/crises/crisis-in-the-central-african-republic|title=Crisis in CAR|work=responsibilitytoprotect.org}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ECCAS failed to monitor the implementation of the Libreville Agreement and Boziz\u00e9 did not undertake any of the reforms necessary under the transition agreement. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka resurged and took control of Bangui and fifteen of CAR's sixteen provinces on 24 March 2013. S\u00e9l\u00e9ka's leader, [[Michel Djotodia]], proclaimed himself President, set up the National Transitional Council (NTC), and suspended CAR's constitution. A hurried ECCAS summit on 4 April 2013, which did not yet recognize Djotodia as President, called for the creation of a Transitional National Council (TNC), which would create a new constitution, conduct elections in eighteen months, and select an interim President. On 13 April, the TNC chose the sole candidate vying for interim president position, Michel Djotodia.<ref name=\"responsibilitytoprotect.org\" />\n\nFrom December 2012 onward, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces, who are predominantly Muslim, committed grave human rights abuses against civilians throughout the country and especially targeted the majority Christian population.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In response, Christian civilians formed \"[[anti-balaka]]\" (\"anti-machete\") militias, which have conducted vicious reprisals against Muslims.

The attack against former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels sparked widespread violence throughout the capital as well as in Ouham province in the northwest. The violence marked a significant escalation of the conflict in CAR. Anti-balaka forces launched another attack against Muslim neighborhoods of Bangui on 20 December, spurring a cycle of renewed violence that led to at least 71 deaths by 24 December. A mass grave of at least 30 people who were reportedly executed and exhibited signs of torture was discovered on 25 December. The [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) estimates a further 40 civilians were killed on 25 December as violence continued between anti-balaka and ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces. Eight African Union (AU) peacekeepers were also killed between 25 and 26 December.<ref name=CARtimeline>http://www.globalr2p.org/media/files/car-timeline-22-jan-14.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to OCHA, by September 2013 there were almost 400,000 internally displaced people and about 65,000 new refugees in neighbouring countries.

The Security Council passed [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2127(2013) Resolution 2127] on 5 December, emphasizing that the NTC has the primary responsibility to protect the civilian population in CAR. The resolution granted a Chapter VII mandate to AU and French forces to protect civilians and restore security, imposed an arms embargo, and established a UN Commission of Inquiry.<ref name=CARtimeline />\n\nIn the beginning, the international response to the coup was purely diplomatic: members of the International Contact Group insisted that Michel Djotodia respect the principles set out in the Libreville agreement. The African Union was the first to react when it announced a new African-led International Support Mission for CAR ([[MISCA]]) in July 2013. However, MISCA has not been effective in reversing the deteriorating security situation. Although its mandate is well-defined, there is general agreement that it does not have the resources to fulfill its mission. The UN General Assembly put CAR on the international agenda in September. [https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2121(2013) Resolution 2121], adopted on 10 October 2013 and sponsored by France, strengthened and broadened the mandate of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). Aware that MISCA alone is unable to adequately tackle the growing insecurity, France has changed its initial position from disengagement to military contribution, as announced by [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] on 20 November 2013, who said that French forces would be reinforced by almost 1,000 troops for a six-month period.<ref name=\"crisisgroup.org\" /> France began to deploy troops in CAR after receiving authorization from the Security Council on 5 December 2013 with Resolution 2127, which authorizes MISCA and French forces to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect civilians and restore security in CAR. French soldiers immediately began to patrol in Bangui.<ref name=CARtimeline />\n\nOn 7 February 2014, it was reported that the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor [[Fatou Bensouda]] said that she had \"opened a preliminary investigation into possible war crimes in the Central African Republic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26089189|title=ICC opens CAR 'war crimes' preliminary investigation|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n=== Syria ===\nOver the last nine years, Syria has been in constant conflict, which has directly killed 500,000 people, generated 5 million refugees, and internally displaced 7 million people. To help stop these atrocities the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), the UN, European Union, the League of Arab States, and other countries had agreed to meet to discuss the situation at stake. The conclusion was made that the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which increased the delivery of humanitarian aid, as well as a nationwide cessation of hostilities, was required in order to help those in need. The Commission on Inquiry, mandated by the Human Rights Council, has found the Syrian government, while working with allied militias, has committed large-scale massacres, perpetrated war crimes and gross violations of international humanitarian law as a matter of state policy. The Commission of Inquiry's third report had stated that the government had committed crimes against humanity through extermination, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance, and other inhuman acts. Due to this statement the UN Human Rights Council has adopted at least 16 different resolutions with regard to the atrocities taking place in Syria.  Despite all efforts and resolutions adopted to help uphold R2P, humanitarian aid has had limited success in reaching the affected populations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/|title=Populations at Risk: Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Burundi ===\nThe country of Burundi is at grave risk for a possible civil war, if violence is not stopped. The civilians of Burundi face the serious and eminent risk of mass atrocities due to the ongoing political violence that threatens the stability of Burundi.  The citizens of Burundi are being harmed through mass atrocity crimes due to targeted killings, widespread violations and abuses of human rights. Violence had increased after President Pierre Nkurnziza had announced he was seeking a third term in the country\u2019s elections, and instructing his citizens to disarm or face action by Burundian Security forces and be labeled enemies of the nation. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports cases of sexual violence by security forces, hate speech, and incitement to violence by some government officials. Responses by the international community include a Security Council-mandated police force with the goal of monitoring the situation. This police force has been rejected by Burundi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalr2p.org/regions/burundi|title=Burundi|website=www.globalr2p.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Yemen Crisis===\nWith the current armed conflict in Yemen, many civilians are facing mass atrocity crimes.

According to the first pillar of R2P, the state has the responsibility to protect its populations from mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing, and according to the second pillar the international community has the responsibility to help states fulfill their responsibility. Advocates of R2P claim that the only occasions where the international community will intervene in a state without its consent is when the state is either allowing mass atrocities to occur, or is committing them, in which case the state is no longer upholding its responsibilities as a sovereign. In this sense, R2P can be understood as reinforcing sovereignty.<ref>Ban Ki-moon, ''Implementing the Responsibility to Protect'', p. 7-8</ref> In 2004, the [[High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]], set up by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, endorsed the emerging norm of R2P, stating that there is a collective international responsibility \"...exercisable by the Security Council authorizing military intervention as a last resort, in the event of genocide and other large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing, and serious violations of humanitarian law which sovereign governments have proved powerless or unwilling to prevent.\"<ref name=\"un.org\" />\n\n=== Libya, 2011 ===\nOn March 19, 2011, the Security Council approved [[Resolution 1973]], which reiterated the responsibility of the Libyan authorities to protect the Libyan population.

These were vetoed by Russia and China. The Russian and Chinese governments both issued statements to the effect that, in their opinion, R2P had been abused by the U.S. as a pretext for \"regime change\", more particularly in the case of Libya, and that as far as they were concerned they would be extremely suspicious of any future Security Council resolutions invoking R2P, based on past experience. According to the UN's own 4 October 2011 coverage of the meeting of the Security Council:\n\n<blockquote>[Russia's UN Ambassador [[Vitaly Churkin]]] was alarmed that compliance with Security Council resolutions in Libya had been considered a model for future actions by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It was important to see how that model had been implemented. The demand for a ceasefire had turned into a civil war, the humanitarian, social and military consequences of which had spilled beyond Libya. The arms embargo had turned into a naval blockade on west Libya. Such models should be excluded from global practice.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[\u2026] [China's UN Ambassador [[Li Baodong]]] hoped that the [Syrian] Government would follow through on reform and a process of dialogue.

However, states will often be wary to engage in humanitarian intervention unless the intervention is partly rooted in self-interest. The appearance that the intervention is not strictly altruistic consequently leads some to question its legitimacy.\n* '''The counterfactual problem''' \u2013 When R2P is successful, there will not be any clear-cut evidence of its success: a mass atrocity that did not occur but would have occurred without intervention. Defenders of R2P consequently have to rely on counterfactual arguments.\n* '''The conspicuous harm problem''' \u2013 While the benefits of the intervention will not be clearly visible, the destructiveness and costs of the intervention will be visible. This makes it more difficult for proponents of the intervention to defend the intervention. The destruction caused by the intervention also makes some question the legitimacy of the intervention due to the stated purpose of preventing harm.\n* '''The end-state problem''' \u2013 Humanitarian intervention is prone to expand the mission beyond simply averting mass atrocities. When successful at averting mass atrocities, the intervenors will often be forced to take upon themselves more expansive mandates to ensure that threatened populations will be safe after the intervenors leave.\n* '''The inconsistency problem''' \u2013 Due to the aforementioned problems, in addition to the belief that a particular military action is likely to cause more harm than good, states may fail to act in situations where mass atrocities loom. The failure to intervene in any and all situations where there is a risk of mass atrocities lead to charges of inconsistency.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sovereignty]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Human security]]\n* [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]\n* [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[International Criminal Court]]\n* [[Rwandan genocide]]\n* [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica Genocide]]\n* [[Peacekeeping]]\n* [[Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Orford, Anne.
