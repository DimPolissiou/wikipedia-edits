The [[Teduray people|Tedurays]], which are the [[lumad]]s of the southwestern highlands of the province make up 8.4 percent of the entire population, while Hiligaynons and Cebuanos constitute the remaining significant groups in the province with each making up 3.2 percent of the population.\n\nThe main languages are [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]] and [[Iranun language|Iranun]]. [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Chavacano language|Chavacano]] are also spoken by both Christians and Muslims, with the dialect of Chavacano native to Cotabato City being called ''Cotabate\u00f1o'', which evolved from the Zamboangue\u00f1o dialect. Teduray, also native to the province, is spoken in the municipalities of Upi, South Upi, and Datu Blah T. Sinsuat.

For the brief period that the province of [[Shariff Kabunsuan]] existed, Maguindanao became a lone-district province. Since the appointment of a new set of provincial officials for the reunified province of Maguindanao by the ARMM Governor in January 2009, the provincial government has reverted to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan district configuration from before Shariff Kabunsuan was created.\n\nHaving elected to join the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), Maguindanao also sends six representatives (three per SP district) to the [[ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly]] that convenes in [[Cotabato City]].\n\n===Provincial capital===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | width1 = 200\n | image1 = Maguindanao Old Provincial Capitol, Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | width2 = 200\n | image2 = Maguindanao Provincial Capitol (4th Maguindanao MTB Challenge).jpg\n | alt2 = \n | footer = The Ampatuan-built former provincial capitol complex in [[Shariff Aguak]] (Left), and new provincial capitol complex in [[Buluan, Maguindanao|Buluan]] (Right).\n}}\nWhen the province was established in 1973, the designated seat of government was the municipality of [[Shariff Aguak|Maganoy]].<ref name=\"GovPH-PD341\"/> The first appointed governor, Simeon Datumanong, held office in Limpongo,<ref name=pcij/> a former barangay in Maganoy which is now part of the municipality of [[Datu Hoffer Ampatuan]].\n\nDatumanong's successor Zacaria Candao, on the other hand, held office at P.C.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} extension opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. This service split into two and re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing extension from OMSI to the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Streetcar]] system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} extension opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated with the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues.

These may include [[GDP]] growth rates, [[inflation]], [[interest rate]]s, [[exchange rate]]s, [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], and energy prices. They subsequently narrow their search to regional/ industry analysis of total sales, price levels, the effects of competing products, foreign competition, and entry or exit from the industry. Only then do they refine their search to the best business in the area being studied.\n*The bottom-up investor starts with specific businesses, regardless of their industry/region, and proceeds in reverse of the top-down approach.\n\n==Procedures==\nThe analysis of a business's health starts with a financial statement analysis that includes [[financial ratio]]s. It looks at dividends paid, [[operating cash flow]], new equity issues and capital financing. The earnings estimates and growth rate projections published widely by [[Thomson Reuters]] and others can be considered either \"fundamental\" (they are facts) or \"technical\" (they are investor sentiment) based on perception of their validity.\n\nDetermined growth rates (of income and cash) and risk levels (to determine the [[discounted cash flow|discount rate]]) are used in various valuation models. The foremost is the [[discounted cash flow]] model, which calculates the present value of the future:\n*[[dividend]]s received by the investor, along with the eventual sale price; ([[Gordon model]])\n*earnings of the company;\n*or [[cash flow]]s of the company.\n\nThe amount of debt a company possesses is also a major consideration in determining its health. It can be quickly assessed using the [[debt-to-equity ratio]] and the ''current ratio'' (current assets/current liabilities).\n\nThe simple model commonly used is the [[P/E ratio]] (price-to-earnings ratio). Implicit in this model of a perpetual annuity ([[time value of money]]) is that the \"flip\" of the P/E is the discount rate appropriate to the risk of the business. The multiple accepted is adjusted for expected growth (which is not built into the model).\n\nGrowth estimates are incorporated into the [[PEG ratio]]. Its validity depends on the length of time analysts believe the growth will continue. IGAR models can be used to impute expected changes in growth from current P/E and historical growth rates for the stocks relative to a comparison index.\n\nComputer modelling of stock prices has now replaced much of the subjective interpretation of fundamental data (along with technical data) in the industry. Since about the year 2000, a new job role has been invented with computers now able to crunch vast amounts of data. At some funds  (Quant Funds) managers' decisions have been replaced by proprietary mathematical models.\n\n==Automation==\nThe process of fundamental analysis has significantly dropped in difficulty over the past 10 years. Ever since computers became a household product, people have built software designed to make the investor's life easier. Fundamental analysis is one of the most time-consuming forms of analysis. Furthermore, with the fast-paced trading style of the 21st century, where markets are dominated by HFT firms and day traders, it is difficult to keep up with the market in a timely fashion. One way to go about cutting down analysis time, is to subscribe to either free or paid screening services. Screening services will allow you to search the entire market for stocks that match the quantitative fields you are looking for. These types of software then automatically give you results, hence cutting down on time spent sifting through SEC filings.\n\nReference - [[Fundamental Analysis Software]] for more information on fundamental analysis software.\n\n==Criticisms==\nEconomists such as [[Burton Malkiel]] suggest that neither fundamental analysis nor [[technical analysis]] is useful in outperforming the markets.<ref>{{cite web|title = Financial Concepts: Random Walk Theory|publisher = Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/university/concepts/concepts5.asp}}</ref> This is especially true of low liquidity markets or securities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dzanic|first=Enis|date=2013-05-10|title=Correlation of Change in Fundamental Indicators and Stock Price Movements on Sarajevo Stock Exchange|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2705713}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of finance topics#Valuation|Lists of valuation topics]]\n* [[Security analysis]]\n* [[Piotroski F-Score]]\n* [[Stock selection criterion]]\n* [[John Burr Williams#Theory]]\n* [[Mosaic theory (investments)|Mosaic theory]]\n* [[Chepakovich valuation model]]\n* [[Fundamental Analysis Software]]\n* [[Financial forecast]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-414-financial-management-summer-2003/ MIT Financial-Management course notes]\n*[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2479817 Fundamental Analysis Works]\n\n{{stock market}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fundamental Analysis}}\n[[Category:Fundamental analysis| ]]\n[[Category:Commodity markets]]\n[[Category:Derivatives (finance)]]\n[[Category:Foreign exchange market]]\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2014}}\n{{Financial markets}}\n'''Fundamental analysis''', in accounting and finance, is the analysis of a business's [[financial statement]]s (usually to analyze the business's [[asset]]s, [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]], and [[earnings]]); health;<ref>{{cite web|title=Technical Analysis vs. Fundamental Analysis|url=http://www.mta.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=what-is-technical-analysis|publisher=[[Market Technicians Association]]|accessdate=6 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312090814/http://www.mta.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=what-is-technical-analysis|archive-date=12 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Competition|competitors]] and [[Market (economics)|markets]].
