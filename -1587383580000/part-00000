Bickram has four GIMA(Global Indian Music Award ) awards to his credit. Bickram was the only tabla maestro to perform for the finale of the Commonwealth games in 2010. He was one of the Composer's for the opening of the Indian Super League.

He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for [[country house]] society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] at the time of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935 Italian invasion]]. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the [[Royal Marines]] and then in the [[Royal Horse Guards]]. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\n\nWaugh converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the [[welfare state]] culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981).\n\n==Family background==\n[[File:Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Lord Cockburn]], the Scottish judge, was one of Waugh's great-great-grandfathers.]]\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903<ref>Eade, p.

Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an [[Military officer|officer]], and, while awaiting confirmation of his [[Commission (document)|commission]], wrote ''The Loom of Youth'' (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne.

A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, [[Dudley Carew]], hints at severe emotional pressures: \"I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 12</ref> He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.<ref>Hastings, p. 112</ref>\n\nBack at home,  Waugh began a novel, ''[[The Temple at Thatch]]'', and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, ''The Scarlet Woman'', which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for [[Kenya]], Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's]].<ref name= S93>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Teaching and writing===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], the subject of Waugh's first full-length book (1927)]]\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 210\u201312</ref> He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[North Wales]], beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, ''The Temple at Thatch'', intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.<ref>Hastings, pp. 116\u201334</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in [[Pisa]], Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer [[Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff]], who was engaged on the English translations of [[Marcel Proust]]'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left [[North Wales]], he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 112</ref> The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 228\u201330</ref>\n\nDuring the following two years Waugh taught at schools in [[Aston Clinton]] (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and [[Notting Hill]] in London.<ref>Hastings, pp. 148\u201349</ref> He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet-making, and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 145\u201347</ref> A short story, \"The Balance\", written in an experimental [[modernist literature|modernist]] style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, ''Georgian Stories''.<ref>Patey, pp. 19\u201320</ref> An extended essay on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the [[Shakespeare Head Press]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where he was undergoing training as a printer.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 505</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Doyle |first=Paul A. |title=Some Unpublished Waugh Correspondence III |url=http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN5-1.htm |journal=Evelyn Waugh Newsletter |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1971 |accessdate=17 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021305/http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN5-1.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}</ref> This led to a contract from the publishers [[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworths]] for a full-length biography of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], which Waugh wrote during 1927.<ref name= Sykes73>Sykes, pp. 73\u201375</ref> He also began working on a [[comic novel]]; after several temporary working titles this became ''[[Decline and Fall]]''.<ref>Waugh diaries, 3 and 4 September 1927: Davie (ed.), p. 289</ref><ref name= Hastings168>Hastings, pp. 168\u201370</ref> Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in April\u2013May 1927.<ref>Sykes, pp. 72\u201373</ref> That year he met (possibly through his brother [[Alec Waugh|Alec]]) and fell in love with [[Evelyn Gardner]], the daughter of [[Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere|Lord and Lady Burghclere]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 152\u201353</ref>\n\n====\"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\"====\n[[File:069 Canonbury Square.jpg|thumb|upright|Canonbury Square, where Waugh and Evelyn Gardner lived during their brief marriage]]\nIn December 1927, Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged, despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere, who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company.<ref>Hastings, pp. 164\u201365</ref> Among their friends, they quickly became known as \"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\".<ref name= StannardODNB/> Waugh was at this time dependent on a \u00a34-a-week allowance from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism.<ref>Hastings, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April 1928: [[J. C. Squire]] in ''The Observer'' praised the book's elegance and wit; Acton gave cautious approval; and the novelist [[Rebecca West]] wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book. Less pleasing to Waugh was the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''{{'}}s references to him as \"Miss Waugh\".<ref name= Hastings168/>\n\nWhen ''Decline and Fall'' was completed, Duckworths objected to its \"obscenity\", but Chapman and Hall agreed to publish it.<ref>Sykes, p. 84</ref> This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans. They were married in St Paul's Church, Portman Square, on 27 June 1928, with only Acton, Alec Waugh and the bride's friend [[Lady Pansy Lamb|Pansy Pakenham]] present.<ref>Hastings, pp. 175\u201376</ref> The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square, [[Islington]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 157</ref> The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money, and by Gardner's poor health, which persisted into the autumn.<ref>Hastings, pp. 177\u201379</ref>\n\nIn September 1928, ''Decline and Fall'' was published to almost unanimous praise. By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500.<ref>Hastings, pp. 180\u201382</ref> In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted [[pneumonia]] and was carried ashore to the British hospital in [[Port Said]]. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, [[John Heygate]], had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the [[annulment]] of their marriage a few years later.<ref>Davie (ed.), pp. 305\u201306</ref>\n\n==Novelist and journalist==\n\n===Recognition===\nWaugh's first biographer, [[Christopher Sykes (author)|Christopher Sykes]], records that after the divorce friends \"saw, or believed they saw, a new hardness and bitterness\" in Waugh's outlook.<ref>Sykes, p. 96</ref> Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he \"did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live\",<ref name= Amory39>Amory (ed.), p. 39</ref> he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, ''[[Vile Bodies]]'',<ref name= Patey33/> and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on the meaning of the marriage ceremony.<ref name= Amory39/> During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.<ref name= Patey33/>\n\n''Vile Bodies'', a satire on the [[Bright Young People]] of the 1920s, was published on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, the book is dark, bitter, \"a manifesto of disillusionment\", according to biographer Martin Stannard.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 203\u201304</ref> As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism.<ref name= Patey33>Patey, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Amid regular work for ''[[The Graphic]]'', ''[[Town and Country (magazine)|Town and Country]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', he quickly wrote ''Labels'', a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.<ref name= Patey33/>\n\n===Conversion to Catholicism===\nOn 29 September 1930, Waugh was received into the Catholic Church. This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time.<ref name= Patey35>Patey, pp. 35\u201339</ref> He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: \"Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church\".<ref>Waugh diaries, 22 December 1926: Davie (ed.), p. 237</ref> The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, \"I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson\".<ref>Waugh diaries, 20 February 1927: Davie (ed.), p. 281</ref> Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, \"She bullied me into the Church\".<ref>Sykes, p. 107</ref> It was she who led him to Father [[Martin D'Arcy]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], who persuaded Waugh \"on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion\" that \"the Christian revelation was genuine\". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was \"unintelligible and unendurable without God\".<ref name= Gallagher366>\"Come Inside\", first published in ''The Road to Damascus'' (1949), ed.

He reported the event as \"an elaborate propaganda effort\" to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation which concealed the fact that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means.<ref>Patey, p. 91</ref> A subsequent journey through the [[British East Africa]] colonies and the [[Belgian Congo]] formed the basis of two books; the travelogue ''Remote People'' (1931) and the comic novel ''[[Black Mischief]]'' (1932).<ref>Sykes, p. 109</ref> Waugh's next extended trip, in the winter of 1932\u20131933, was to [[Guyana|British Guiana]] (now Guyana) in South America, possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite [[Teresa Jungman]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 276, 310</ref> On arrival in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior. He travelled on via several staging-posts to [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] in Brazil, and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown.<ref>Hastings, pp. 272\u201381</ref> His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books: his travel account ''Ninety-two Days'', and the novel ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', both published in 1934.<ref>Hastings, pp. 296, 306</ref>\n\nBack from South America, Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and [[blasphemy]] from the Catholic journal ''[[The Tablet]]'', which objected to passages in ''Black Mischief''. He defended himself in an open letter to the [[Archbishop of Westminster]], Cardinal [[Francis Bourne]],<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 72\u201378</ref> which remained unpublished until 1980. In the summer of 1934, he went on an expedition to [[Spitsbergen]] in the [[Arctic]], an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 367\u201374</ref> On his return, determined to write a major Catholic biography, he selected the [[Jesuit]] martyr [[Edmund Campion]] as his subject. The book, published in 1935, caused controversy by its forthright pro-Catholic, anti-[[Protestant]] stance but brought its writer the [[Hawthornden Prize]].<ref>Patey, p. 126</ref><ref>Hastings, pp. 324\u201325</ref> He returned to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening stages of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] for the ''Daily Mail''. Waugh, on the basis of his earlier visit, considered Abyssinia  \"a savage place which [[Mussolini]] was doing well to tame\" according to his fellow reporter, [[Bill Deedes|William Deedes]].<ref>Deedes, p. 15</ref> Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent.<ref>Davie, p. 391</ref> Deedes remarks on the older writer's snobbery: \"None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home\".<ref>Deedes, pp. 35\u201336</ref> However, in the face of imminent Italian air attacks, Deedes found Waugh's courage \"deeply reassuring\".<ref>Deedes, pp. 62\u201363</ref> Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book, ''Waugh in Abyssinia'' (1936), which [[Rose Macaulay]] dismissed as a \"fascist tract\", on account of its pro-Italian tone.<ref>Patey, p. 141</ref> A better-known account is his novel ''[[Scoop (novel)|Scoop]]'' (1938), in which the protagonist, William Boot, is loosely based on Deedes.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 406</ref>\n\nAmong Waugh's growing circle of friends were [[Diana Mitford|Diana Guinness]] and [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Guinness]] (dedicatees of ''[[Vile Bodies]]''), [[Lady Diana Cooper]] and her husband [[Duff Cooper]],<ref>Hastings, p. 263</ref> [[Nancy Mitford]] who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner's,<ref>Hastings, p. 191</ref> and the [[Earl Beauchamp|Lygon sisters]]. Waugh had known [[Hugh Patrick Lygon]] at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, [[Madresfield Court]], which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering.<ref>Byrne, p. 155</ref> In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer [[Aubrey Herbert]]. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in [[Portofino]], where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.<ref>Hastings pp. 284\u201387</ref>\n\n===Second marriage===\nOn his conversion, Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive. However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] of the marriage on the grounds of \"lack of real consent\". The case was heard by an [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunal]] in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936.<ref>Hastings, pp. 290\u201393</ref> In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert.<ref>Byrne, pp. 240\u201341</ref> He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936.<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 103\u201305</ref> There were initial misgivings from the [[Herbert family|Herberts]], an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the [[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Church of the Assumption]] in Warwick Street, London.<ref>Byrne, pp. 260\u201361</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p6634.htm|title=Person Page|website=thepeerage.com|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near [[Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire|Stinchcombe]] in Gloucestershire.<ref>Hastings, pp. 358\u201359</ref> The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, [[Auberon Waugh|Auberon Alexander]], on 17 November 1939.<ref>Hastings, pp. 336 and 392</ref> Between these events, ''Scoop'' was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim.<ref>Stannard, Vol. i pp. 470\u201371</ref> In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to [[Mexico]] after which he wrote ''[[Robbery Under Law]]'', based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".<ref>Sykes, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Royal Marine and commando===\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and moved his young family to [[Pixton Park]] in [[Somerset]], the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment.<ref>Hastings, pp. 384\u201386</ref> He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration,<ref>Sykes, pp. 273\u201376</ref> but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Marines]] in December and entered training at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] naval base.<ref>Hastings, pp. 391\u201392</ref> He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as ''Work Suspended and Other Stories'' (1943).<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 490\u2013501</ref>\n\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II, p. 2</ref> In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and given command of a [[company (military unit)|company]] of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 9</ref> Even after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the Low Countries]] (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 15</ref> Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the [[Battle of Dakar]] in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the [[Free French Forces]] to overthrow the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial government and install General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \"Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\"<ref name= Stannard16>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 16\u201320</ref><ref>Amory (ed.), p. 141</ref>\n\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a [[commando]] unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"[[Layforce]]\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) [[Robert Laycock]].<ref name= Stannard16/> In February 1941, the unit sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture [[Bardia]], on the Libyan coast.<ref>Hastings, pp. 421\u201322</ref> In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of [[Crete]]: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops.<ref>Sykes, pp. 215\u201316</ref> In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s.<ref>Patey, p. 171</ref> Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the [[Royal Horse Guards]], on Laycock's recommendation.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 66\u201367</ref> On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.<ref>Hastings, p. 442</ref>{{refn|Earlier, Laura had borne a daughter, christened Mary, on 1 December 1940, but she lived only a few hours.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 24</ref>|group= n}}\n\n===Frustration, ''Brideshead'' and Yugoslavia===\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of [[Operation Husky]] (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 445\u201346</ref> Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier.<ref>Sykes, pp. 229\u201330</ref> After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Waugh began parachute training at [[Tatton Park]], Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a [[fibula]]. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for [[Chagford]], Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was ''[[Brideshead Revisited|Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder]]'' (1945),<ref>Hastings, pp. 454\u201362</ref> the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer [[Douglas Lane Patey]] commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".<ref>Patey, p. 296</ref>\n\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by [[Randolph Churchill]] to serve in a military mission to [[Yugoslavia]], and, early in July, flew with Churchill from [[Bari]], Italy, to the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. There, they met [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]], the Communist leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces with Allied support.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 113\u201314</ref> Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 116\u201321</ref>\n\nThe mission eventually arrived at [[Topusko]], where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the [[British Army]] and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and would fare worse when the Communists took control.<ref>Hastings, pp. 468\u201373</ref> He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in [[Dubrovnik]] and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.<ref>Hastings, pp. 485\u201391</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Fame and fortune===\n''Brideshead Revisited'' was published in London in May 1945.<ref name= Hastings494>Hastings, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\".<ref>Patey, p. 224</ref> It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status.<ref name= Hastings494/> Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of [[Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\".<ref>Gallagher (ed.), pp. 289\u201390</ref> Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he saw the accession to power of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".<ref name= Hastings494/>\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], the subject of Waugh's 1950 novel]]\n\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944)<ref>Hastings, pp. 462 and 494\u201397</ref> but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the [[Nuremberg trials]], and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Francisco de Vitoria]], said to be the founder of [[international law]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 168</ref> Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, ''[[Scott-King's Modern Europe]]''.<ref name= Patey251>Patey, p. 251</ref> In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of ''Brideshead''. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn cemetery]], which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, ''[[The Loved One]]''.<ref name= StannardODNB/> In 1951 he visited the [[Holy Land]] with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes,<ref>Sykes, pp. 338\u201342</ref> and in 1953, he travelled to [[Goa]] to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest [[Francis Xavier]].<ref name= Hastings554>Hastings, p. 554</ref><ref>Waugh's article on the Goa visit, \"Goa, the Home of s Saint\" is reprinted in Gallager (ed.), pp. 448\u201356</ref>\n\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the [[True Cross]] that was \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".<ref>Patey, p. 289</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Waugh published ''[[Men at Arms (Evelyn Waugh)|Men at Arms]]'', the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 5, 82, 340</ref> Other books published during this period included ''[[When The Going Was Good]]'' (1946),<ref name= Patey251/> an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, ''The Holy Places'' (published by the [[Ian Fleming]]-managed [[Queen Anne Press]], 1952) and ''[[Love Among the Ruins. A Romance of the Near Future|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1953), a [[dystopia]]n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world.<ref>Hastings, p. 553</ref> Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.<ref>Hastings, pp. 531 and 537</ref>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's [[Portobello Market]] and from house clearance sales.<ref name= P153/> His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to [[Gloucester]], where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335&nbsp;... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\".<ref>Davie (ed.), p. 658</ref> Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value.

He was perceived as out of step with the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available.<ref name= Hastings554/> His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, ''[[Officers and Gentlemen]]'', had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.<ref>Patey, p. 324</ref> Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 415</ref> [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Brown|first= Mark|title= Waugh at the BBC: \"the most ill-natured interview ever\" on CD after 55 years\"|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/15/bbc.radio|journal= The Guardian|date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], Stephen Black. He left the ship in [[Egypt]] and flew on to [[Colombo]], but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him.<ref>Patey, p. 325</ref> Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, [[Frances Donaldson]], whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from [[bromism|bromide poisoning]] from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared.<ref>Donaldson, pp. 56\u201361</ref> Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was  fictionalised a few years later, in ''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold]]'' (1957).<ref>Patey, pp. 326, 338\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[Edwin Newman]] made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned [[dip pen]]. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of [[whisky]], and that every American had been divorced at least once.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Newman |authorlink=Edwin Newman |title=Strictly Speaking: will America be the death of English? |url=https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm |url-access=registration |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm/page/134 134] }}</ref>\n\n===Late works===\n[[File:Combe Florey - near the Old Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 904793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Combe Florey]], the village in Somerset to which Waugh and his family moved in 1956]]\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished ''Officers and Gentlemen''. In June 1955 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist and reviewer [[Nancy Spain]], accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for ''The Spectator'',<ref>\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in ''The Spectator'', 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370</ref> but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 636</ref> Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of [[Combe Florey]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386</ref> In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the ''Express'' and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.<ref>Stannard, pp. 382\u201383</ref>\n\n''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold|Gilbert Pinfold]]'' was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 477</ref> The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate.<ref name= Patey339>Patey, pp. 339\u201341</ref> Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend [[Ronald Knox]], the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in [[Cyprus]]. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.<ref>Wykes, p. 194</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life.<ref name= H591/> In 1950, as a means of [[tax avoidance]], he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the [[Save the Children|well-established charity of that name]]) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books.<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 254\u201355</ref> He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' series conducted by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]]. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer [[Selina Hastings (writer)|Selena Hastings]], Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".<ref name= H591>Hastings, pp. 591\u201392</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 415\u201316</ref> In September, he produced his final travel book, ''[[A Tourist in Africa]]'', based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\".<ref>Patey, pp. 346\u201347</ref> The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as ''Unconditional Surrender''.<ref>Hastings, pp. 594\u201398</ref>\n\n===Decline and death===\n[[File:Evelyn Waugh Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Waugh's grave in Combe Florey, adjacent to but not within the Anglican churchyard.]]\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey.<ref>Patey, p. 359</ref> His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 477</ref> In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story ''Basil Seal Rides Again''. This revival of the protagonist of ''Black Mischief'' and ''Put Out More Flags'' was published in 1963; the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' called it a \"nasty little book\".<ref>{{cite journal| last= Willett|first= John|title= A Rake Raked Up| journal= The Times Literary Supplement| date= 14 November 1963| page = 921}}</ref> When the first volume of autobiography, ''A Little Learning'', was published in 1964, Waugh's often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 480</ref>\n\nWaugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of [[Pope John XXIII]]<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 514\u201315</ref> and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963.<ref>\"An Appreciation of Pope John\" first published in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', 27 July 1963, reprinted in Gallagher (ed.), pp. 614\u201318</ref> However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the [[Second Vatican Council]], which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, [[Pope Paul VI]], until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by the replacement of the universal [[Latin Mass]] with the [[vernacular]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 616\u201320.</ref> In a ''Spectator'' article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as \"sharp-edged reasonableness\".<ref>{{cite journal| last= Stinson| first= John J | title = Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Burgess: Some Parallels as Catholic Writers | journal= Evelyn Waugh Newsletter and Studies|volume= 38|issue= 2| date = September 2008 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/34366316/evelyn-waugh-anthony-burgess-some-parallels-as-catholic-writers | accessdate= 12 May 2016}}</ref><ref>\"More of the same, Please\", first published in ''The Spectator'' 23 November 1962, reprinted in Gallagher (ed.), pp. 602\u201309.</ref> He wrote to Nancy Mitford that \"the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to me&nbsp;....

Waugh's agent, A. D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount,<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 485</ref> but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography.

Although he praised younger writers, such as [[Angus Wilson]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[V.S. Naipaul]], he was scornful of the 1950s writers' group known as \"[[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]]\". He said that the literary world was \"sinking into black disaster\" and that literature might die within thirty years.<ref>Patey, pp. 320\u201321</ref> As a schoolboy, Waugh had praised the art of [[Cubism]] but soon abandoned his interest in artistic [[Modernism]].<ref>Gallagher (ed.), p. 5</ref> In 1945, Waugh said that [[Pablo Picasso]]'s artistic standing was the result of a \"mesmeric trick\" and that his paintings \"could not be intelligently discussed in the terms used of the civilised [[Old Masters|masters]]\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 214</ref> In 1953, in a radio interview, he named [[Augustus Egg]] (1816\u20131863) as a painter for whom he had particular esteem.{{refn|Excerpts from the text of the broadcast, on 16 November 1953, are given in the 1998 Penguin Books edition of ''The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold'', p. 135\u2013143|group= n}} Despite their political differences, Waugh came to admire [[George Orwell]], because of their shared patriotism and sense of [[morality]].<ref>Lebedoff, p. 161\u201362, 175\u201377</ref>\n\nThroughout his literary works, Evelyn Waugh freely expressed [[racialism|racial]] and [[anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] prejudices, especially in the books he wrote before the [[Second World War]].

He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for [[country house]] society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] at the time of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935 Italian invasion]]. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the [[Royal Marines]] and then in the [[Royal Horse Guards]]. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\n\nWaugh converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the [[welfare state]] culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981).\n\n==Family background==\n[[File:Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Lord Cockburn]], the Scottish judge, was one of Waugh's great-great-grandfathers.]]\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903<ref>Eade, p.

Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an [[Military officer|officer]], and, while awaiting confirmation of his [[Commission (document)|commission]], wrote ''The Loom of Youth'' (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne.

A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, [[Dudley Carew]], hints at severe emotional pressures: \"I have been living very intensely these last three weeks.

I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 12</ref> He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.<ref>Hastings, p. 112</ref>\n\nBack at home,  Waugh began a novel, ''[[The Temple at Thatch]]'', and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, ''The Scarlet Woman'', which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for [[Kenya]], Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's]].<ref name= S93>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Teaching and writing===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], the subject of Waugh's first full-length book (1927)]]\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 210\u201312</ref> He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[North Wales]], beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, ''The Temple at Thatch'', intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.<ref>Hastings, pp. 116\u201334</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in [[Pisa]], Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer [[Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff]], who was engaged on the English translations of [[Marcel Proust]]'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left [[North Wales]], he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 112</ref> The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea.

By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500.<ref>Hastings, pp. 180\u201382</ref> In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted [[pneumonia]] and was carried ashore to the British hospital in [[Port Said]]. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, [[John Heygate]], had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929.

The case was heard by an [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunal]] in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936.<ref>Hastings, pp. 290\u201393</ref> In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert.<ref>Byrne, pp. 240\u201341</ref> He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936.<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 103\u201305</ref> There were initial misgivings from the [[Herbert family|Herberts]], an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the [[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Church of the Assumption]] in Warwick Street, London.<ref>Byrne, pp. 260\u201361</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p6634.htm|title=Person Page|website=thepeerage.com|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near [[Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire|Stinchcombe]] in Gloucestershire.<ref>Hastings, pp. 358\u201359</ref> The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, [[Auberon Waugh|Auberon Alexander]], on 17 November 1939.<ref>Hastings, pp. 336 and 392</ref> Between these events, ''Scoop'' was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim.<ref>Stannard, Vol. i pp. 470\u201371</ref> In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to [[Mexico]] after which he wrote ''[[Robbery Under Law]]'', based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".<ref>Sykes, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Royal Marine and commando===\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and moved his young family to [[Pixton Park]] in [[Somerset]], the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment.<ref>Hastings, pp. 384\u201386</ref> He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration,<ref>Sykes, pp. 273\u201376</ref> but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Marines]] in December and entered training at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] naval base.<ref>Hastings, pp. 391\u201392</ref> He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as ''Work Suspended and Other Stories'' (1943).<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 490\u2013501</ref>\n\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II, p. 2</ref> In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and given command of a [[company (military unit)|company]] of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 9</ref> Even after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the Low Countries]] (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 15</ref> Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the [[Battle of Dakar]] in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the [[Free French Forces]] to overthrow the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial government and install General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \"Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\"<ref name= Stannard16>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 16\u201320</ref><ref>Amory (ed.), p. 141</ref>\n\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a [[commando]] unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"[[Layforce]]\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) [[Robert Laycock]].<ref name= Stannard16/> In February 1941, the unit sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture [[Bardia]], on the Libyan coast.<ref>Hastings, pp. 421\u201322</ref> In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of [[Crete]]: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops.<ref>Sykes, pp. 215\u201316</ref> In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s.<ref>Patey, p. 171</ref> Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the [[Royal Horse Guards]], on Laycock's recommendation.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 66\u201367</ref> On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.<ref>Hastings, p. 442</ref>{{refn|Earlier, Laura had borne a daughter, christened Mary, on 1 December 1940, but she lived only a few hours.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 24</ref>|group= n}}\n\n===Frustration, ''Brideshead'' and Yugoslavia===\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of [[Operation Husky]] (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 445\u201346</ref> Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier.<ref>Sykes, pp. 229\u201330</ref> After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Waugh began parachute training at [[Tatton Park]], Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a [[fibula]]. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for [[Chagford]], Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was ''[[Brideshead Revisited|Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder]]'' (1945),<ref>Hastings, pp. 454\u201362</ref> the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer [[Douglas Lane Patey]] commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".<ref>Patey, p. 296</ref>\n\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by [[Randolph Churchill]] to serve in a military mission to [[Yugoslavia]], and, early in July, flew with Churchill from [[Bari]], Italy, to the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. There, they met [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]], the Communist leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces with Allied support.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 113\u201314</ref> Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 116\u201321</ref>\n\nThe mission eventually arrived at [[Topusko]], where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the [[British Army]] and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and would fare worse when the Communists took control.<ref>Hastings, pp. 468\u201373</ref> He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in [[Dubrovnik]] and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.<ref>Hastings, pp. 485\u201391</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Fame and fortune===\n''Brideshead Revisited'' was published in London in May 1945.<ref name= Hastings494>Hastings, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\".<ref>Patey, p. 224</ref> It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status.<ref name= Hastings494/> Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of [[Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\".<ref>Gallagher (ed.), pp. 289\u201390</ref> Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he saw the accession to power of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".<ref name= Hastings494/>\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], the subject of Waugh's 1950 novel]]\n\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944)<ref>Hastings, pp. 462 and 494\u201397</ref> but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the [[Nuremberg trials]], and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Francisco de Vitoria]], said to be the founder of [[international law]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 168</ref> Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, ''[[Scott-King's Modern Europe]]''.<ref name= Patey251>Patey, p. 251</ref> In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of ''Brideshead''. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn cemetery]], which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, ''[[The Loved One]]''.<ref name= StannardODNB/> In 1951 he visited the [[Holy Land]] with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes,<ref>Sykes, pp. 338\u201342</ref> and in 1953, he travelled to [[Goa]] to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest [[Francis Xavier]].<ref name= Hastings554>Hastings, p. 554</ref><ref>Waugh's article on the Goa visit, \"Goa, the Home of s Saint\" is reprinted in Gallager (ed.), pp. 448\u201356</ref>\n\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the [[True Cross]] that was \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".<ref>Patey, p. 289</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Waugh published ''[[Men at Arms (Evelyn Waugh)|Men at Arms]]'', the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 5, 82, 340</ref> Other books published during this period included ''[[When The Going Was Good]]'' (1946),<ref name= Patey251/> an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, ''The Holy Places'' (published by the [[Ian Fleming]]-managed [[Queen Anne Press]], 1952) and ''[[Love Among the Ruins. A Romance of the Near Future|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1953), a [[dystopia]]n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world.<ref>Hastings, p. 553</ref> Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.<ref>Hastings, pp. 531 and 537</ref>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's [[Portobello Market]] and from house clearance sales.<ref name= P153/> His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to [[Gloucester]], where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335&nbsp;... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\".<ref>Davie (ed.), p. 658</ref> Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value. Waugh also began, from 1949, to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting.<ref name= P153>Patey, pp. 153\u201354</ref>{{refn|See, for example, \"Rossetti Revisited\", 1949 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 377\u201379; \"Age of Unrest\", 1954 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 459\u201360; \"The Death of Painting\", 1956 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 503\u201307|group= n}}\n\n===Breakdown===\nBy 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available.<ref name= Hastings554/> His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, ''[[Officers and Gentlemen]]'', had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.<ref>Patey, p. 324</ref> Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 415</ref> [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Brown|first= Mark|title= Waugh at the BBC: \"the most ill-natured interview ever\" on CD after 55 years\"|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/15/bbc.radio|journal= The Guardian|date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], Stephen Black. He left the ship in [[Egypt]] and flew on to [[Colombo]], but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him.<ref>Patey, p. 325</ref> Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, [[Frances Donaldson]], whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from [[bromism|bromide poisoning]] from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared.<ref>Donaldson, pp. 56\u201361</ref> Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was  fictionalised a few years later, in ''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold]]'' (1957).<ref>Patey, pp. 326, 338\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[Edwin Newman]] made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned [[dip pen]]. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of [[whisky]], and that every American had been divorced at least once.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Newman |authorlink=Edwin Newman |title=Strictly Speaking: will America be the death of English? |url=https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm |url-access=registration |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm/page/134 134] }}</ref>\n\n===Late works===\n[[File:Combe Florey - near the Old Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 904793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Combe Florey]], the village in Somerset to which Waugh and his family moved in 1956]]\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished ''Officers and Gentlemen''. In June 1955 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist and reviewer [[Nancy Spain]], accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for ''The Spectator'',<ref>\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in ''The Spectator'', 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370</ref> but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 636</ref> Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of [[Combe Florey]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386</ref> In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the ''Express'' and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.<ref>Stannard, pp. 382\u201383</ref>\n\n''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold|Gilbert Pinfold]]'' was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 477</ref> The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate.<ref name= Patey339>Patey, pp. 339\u201341</ref> Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend [[Ronald Knox]], the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in [[Cyprus]]. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.<ref>Wykes, p. 194</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life.<ref name= H591/> In 1950, as a means of [[tax avoidance]], he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the [[Save the Children|well-established charity of that name]]) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books.<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 254\u201355</ref> He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' series conducted by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]]. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer [[Selina Hastings (writer)|Selena Hastings]], Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".<ref name= H591>Hastings, pp. 591\u201392</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 415\u201316</ref> In September, he produced his final travel book, ''[[A Tourist in Africa]]'', based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\".<ref>Patey, pp. 346\u201347</ref> The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as ''Unconditional Surrender''.<ref>Hastings, pp. 594\u201398</ref>\n\n===Decline and death===\n[[File:Evelyn Waugh Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Waugh's grave in Combe Florey, adjacent to but not within the Anglican churchyard.]]\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey.<ref>Patey, p. 359</ref> His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 477</ref> In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story ''Basil Seal Rides Again''.

Waugh's agent, A.D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount,<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 485</ref> but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography.

(66).\n\nSt Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules For Dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p. 45</ref>\n\nIn 1902, [[Charlie Baker (footballer)|Charlie Baker]] became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.\n\n====1907: First finals series====\nSix successive wins at the start of the [[1907 VFL season|1907 season]] saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses.\n\nSt Kilda were beaten by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in [[1908 VFL season|1908]] and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points.\n\n====1913: First grand final====\n[[File:St kilda 1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|St Kilda squad for the 1913 Grand Final]]\nThe 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 grand final]] by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda \u2013 the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point \u2013 and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).\n\nDue to World War I the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49.\n\n===1918\u20131939: Between the wars===\n\n====1925: First Brownlow medallist====\n[[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\nThe following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and were eliminated once again by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals.\n\n====1930s====\nIn 1936, [[Bill Mohr]] became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season.\n\nBill Mohr kicked 101 goals in [[1936 VFL season|1936]] and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.\n\nThe mid-1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in [[1939 VFL season|1939]] by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.<ref name=\"saints.com.au\"/>  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final.\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nSt Kilda won three of the first four games early in the [[1940 VFL season|1940 season]] and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Although there were some prominent players like [[Harold Bray]], [[Keith Drinan]], [[Peter Bennett (footballer, born 1926)|Peter Bennett]] and later [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]], St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The [[1950 VFL season|1950 season]] saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956.\n\nIn 1956 [[Bill Young (Australian rules footballer)|Bill Young]] became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals.\n\n====1957\u20131959: Consecutive Brownlow medallists====\nIn 1957, [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]] became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.\n\nAlso in 1958, St Kilda won the [[1958 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series competition]], a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.\n\nIn 1959, [[Verdun Howell]] became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Howell had tied with [[Bob Skilton]] in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back \u2013 with Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively.\n\nIn 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach. St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] in the first semi-final.  The club finished ninth in [[1962 VFL season|1962]] with nine wins and nine losses.\n\nIn 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the [[1964 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series]] competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73).\n\nSt Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the [[1963 VFL season|1963 season]] to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. The club lost to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in the semi-finals.\n\n===1960\u20131973: Successful era===\n\n===Departure from the Junction Oval===\nBy the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club was seeking to move its playing base away from the [[Junction Oval]], frustrated by disputes and relationships with the [[St Kilda Cricket Club]]. In 1959, the club made enquiries about a 50-year lease to play at and develop [[Elsternwick Park]] in the neighbouring suburb of [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], but no deal was signed.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=4 April 1959|page=54|author=Jack Dunn|title=St Kilda to seek new home ground|publication-place=Melbourne}}</ref> In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its training and administrative base to the large [[Moorabbin Oval]] in Linton St, [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], approximately 10&nbsp;km south-east of St Kilda, starting from the [[1965 VFL season|1965 season]].<ref name=\"sun25mar\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=52|author=Jack Dunn|date=25 March 1964|title=Saints will move to Moorabbin in '65}}</ref> The club signed a 75-year lease in August 1964 for controlling occupancy of the venue, and established a social club on the site.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=56|author=Rex Pullen|date=5 August 1964|title=Saints given 75-yr. lease}}</ref> The move cost the local [[Moorabbin Football Club]] its place in the [[Victorian Football Association]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=20|author=Peter Stone|date=4 April 1964|title=V.F.A. suspends Moorabbin for season}}</ref>\n\nSt Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the [[Junction Oval]] was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], which St Kilda won 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#6 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> Its first home game at Moorabbin was a 6-point win over Collingwood 8.12 (60) d. 8.6 (54) in front of a crowd of 51,370, which is still the ground record for Moorabbin Oval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_moorabbin_oval.html|title=Moorabbin Oval - Attendances (1965\u20131992)|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1965: First minor premiership===\nSt Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history.\n\nSt Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the [[1965 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n[[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Stewart tied on votes with [[Noel Teasdale]] of [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and was awarded the 1965 Brownlow on a count-back.\n\n====1966: First premiership====\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1966 VFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | St Kilda || '''10''' || '''14''' || '''74'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || 10 || 13 || 73\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 101,655\n|}\n\n1966 saw St Kilda qualify for finals series in consecutive years for the first time since 1907\u201308. 14 wins and 4 losses in the home and away rounds qualified the club for the finals in second place.\n\nIan Stewart was the first St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1966 Brownlow Medal with 21 votes. The second consecutive year he won the league's highest individual award and the sixth Brownlow Medal won by a St Kilda player.\n\nSt Kilda were defeated by Collingwood in the second semi-final 15. 9. (99) to 13. 11. (89). The club progressed to the 1966 Grand Final after defeating Essendon in the preliminary final 15. 4. (94) to 7. 10. (52).\n\nSt Kilda went on to defeat Collingwood in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final]] 10.14 (74) to 10.13 (73), winning the club's first ever premiership.\n\n====Late 1960s====\nIn 1967, [[Ross G. Smith|Ross Smith]] became the sixth St Kilda player to win Brownlow Medal.  This was also the third consecutive year that a St Kilda player had won the Brownlow Medal and the second time in the club's history that they had Brownlow Medalists in three consecutive years.\n\nThe [[1968 VFL season|1968 season]] saw St Kilda qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. St Kilda were eliminated by Geelong in the first semi-final.\n\n====1970\u20131973: Consecutive finals series====\nA seventh place home and away season finish in [[1969 VFL season|1969]] was followed by another finals appearance in [[1970 VFL season|1970]], when St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated South Melbourne in the first semifinal and went on to be eliminated by eventual premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the preliminary final.\n\nSt Kilda qualified for the finals series in second place in [[1971 VFL season|1971]] at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins.  St Kilda was defeated by Hawthorn by two points in the second semifinal, defeated Richmond in the preliminary final and was defeated in the [[1971 VFL Grand Final]] by Hawthorn.\n\nThe club qualified for the finals series again in [[1972 VFL season|1972]] in fourth with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final and Collingwood in the first semifinal before being eliminated in the preliminary final by Carlton.\n\n[[1973 VFL season|1973]] saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth place with 12 wins.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final before being eliminated in the semifinals by Richmond.\n\n[[1974 VFL season|1974]] saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins.  The club failed to build on competitive seasons in [[1975 VFL season|1975]] and [[1976 VFL season|1976]]. Allan Jeans coaching career at St Kilda ended at the end of the 1976 season after 16 seasons.\n\n[[1978 VFL season|1978]] began and ended strongly, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. [[1979 VFL season|1979]] began well with a win over Hawthorn before a run of defeats and finishing a clear last.  Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.\n\nIn [[1987 VFL season|1987]], with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since [[1982 VFL season|1982]] with nine wins. Tony Lockett won the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading goalkicker in the home and away season, the fourth St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker award. Lockett became the second St Kilda player to kick more than 100 goals in a season (117).\n\nLockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the [[Brownlow Medal]]. He remains the only person in league history to win both the league's best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the league's leading goalkicker Coleman Medal award in the same season. Lockett also won St Kilda's best and fairest award, now called the [[Trevor Barker Award]], and the Leigh Matthews Trophy (players association most valuable player) in the same year. He is the only person in league history to win the Brownlow, Coleman, club best and fairest and Leigh Matthews Trophy in the same year in 1987.\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nThe league was officially renamed the [[Australian Football League]] prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.\n\nA competitive [[1991 AFL season]] saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the elimination final.\n\nTony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season in 1991, the first St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker twice.\n\nLockett's 118 goals in 1991 was the third year a St Kilda player had kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nIn a competitive [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]], St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. \nTony Lockett's 132 goals in 1992 was the fourth year a St Kilda player kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nSt Kilda won its first finals series match since 1973, over Collingwood, before being by eliminated from the 1992 finals series by Footscray in the semi-finals.\n\n====1992: Last home game at Moorabbin====\nThe AFL embarked on a strategy of grounds rationalisation in the early 1990s and, with Moorabbin Oval's facilities ageing, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to [[Waverley Park]] from 1993. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members and shareholders by a margin of 8750 to 6555 in July 1992.  The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL's grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club's debt.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=40|author=Patrick Smithers|date=14 July 1992|title=Saints vote for move to Waverley}}</ref> St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was the Round 20 match on 1 August 1992, an 18-point win over the Fitzroy Lions in front of 27,736.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#31 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> St Kilda Football Club retained Moorabbin Oval as a training, administration and entertainment venue.\n\n====1996: First pre-season cup win====\nSt Kilda won the [[1996 Ansett Australia Cup]] competition, the pre-season cup.

St Kilda finished second after being beaten in the [[1997 AFL Grand Final]] by Adelaide.\n\n====1998\u20132000====\nPrior to the start of the [[1998 AFL season|1998 season]], St Kilda progressed to the [[1998 Ansett Australia Cup]] final in which they were defeated by North Melbourne.\n\nSt Kilda made their best start to a season since 1972 by winning five out of six matches by Round 6. At the half-way mark of the 1998 season, St Kilda had jumped to top spot on the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses after defeating the Western Bulldogs in a top of the ladder clash at Waverley Park and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team's performance dramatically faded after going from second place in Round 17 to sixth at the home and away games conclusion in Round 22. During this period St Kilda defeated Geelong in Round 16 and West Coast in Round 21. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals. Consolation for the team's performance that year was Robert Harvey becoming the second St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1998 Brownlow Medal with 32 votes, the highest ever votes at the time. He would also be the second St Kilda player to win consecutive Brownlow Medals and the tenth St Kilda Brownlow Medalist.\n\n;1999 \u2013 Farewell to Waverley Park\nSt Kilda made a good start to the 1999 premiership season after progressing to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25-point loss to North Melbourne which ended their chance at a third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#28 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at [[Docklands Stadium]] (currently known by its sponsorship name as Marvel Stadium) whilst maintaining the club's training and administration headquarters at Moorabbin.\n\n===2000\u20132008: From wooden spoon to finals===\n\n====2000\u20132003====\nThe Saints struggled in the early part of this decade, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. They did not fare well in [[2001 AFL season|2001]] or [[2002 AFL season|2002]] either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as [[Justin Koschitzke]], [[Nick Riewoldt]], [[Nick Dal Santo]] and [[Brendon Goddard]], who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end.

The match was held in Wellington, New Zealand, on 25 April ([[Anzac Day]]), the day each year on which both Australia and New Zealand commemorate the soldiers from both countries who have fought in conflicts around the world.\n\nThe match began in the early evening and was held at Westpac Trust Stadium with the Saints hosting the Sydney Swans. The match was played in frigid and slippery conditions. The Saints lost the match by 16 points.\n\nIn Round 23, St Kilda hosted Fremantle in what would be the last game for three 200 game players, [[Stephen Milne]], [[Jason Blake (footballer)|Jason Blake]] and [[Justin Koschitzke]]. The Saints won by 71 points.\n\nSt Kilda won five matches for the year and finished 16th on the ladder. On 1 November, senior coach [[Scott Watters]] was sacked. On 14 November, former Port Adelaide director of coaching [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] was announced as new senior coach for the next three years. In the off-season, the Saints trading negotiations resulted in the arrival of [[Shane Savage]], [[Luke Delaney]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Billy Longer]], while also picking up draft picks 3, 18 and 19, which were used to take [[Jack Billings]], [[Luke Dunstan]] and Blake Acres respectively.\n\nSt Kilda began 2014 under new coach Richardson with a 17-point win over favourites Melbourne. They followed this with a win over the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] to start the season 2-0 for the first time since 2010. After a close loss to West Coast and a heavy defeat to Adelaide, the Saints managed to upset top eight favourites Essendon by 16 points. Following this, the Saints lost the next 11 games, including losses by over 80 points to Hawthorn, Collingwood, Geelong and Carlton. On 15 July, [[Lenny Hayes]] announced that he would retire at the end of the 2014 season. The following weekend, the Saints beat Fremantle by 58 points at Etihad Stadium in the upset of the season. The Saints then lost the remaining five games to end the season with 4 wins and 18 losses as well as their first wooden spoon since 2000. With pick one in the draft, St Kilda selected key forward [[Patrick McCartin]].\n\nIn 2015, the club still struggled to compete with the higher echelons of the competition, however, the team still showed its potential with an eleven-goal comeback against the Western Bulldogs a particular highlight, as well as the emergence of key forward [[Josh Bruce]], who finished the year with 50 goals. 2016 saw the club begin to challenge for the top 8, however despite gaining twelve wins (including victories against Geelong and eventual premiers the Western Bulldogs) and the continued development of the club's young stars, St Kilda finished ninth on the AFL ladder, missing the finals on percentage.\n\nIn 2017, St Kilda once again challenged for a spot in the top 8, highlighted by their Round 16 victory over eventual premiers Richmond, in which they recorded an 82-point margin at half time, leading 14.8 (92) to 1.4 (10) before running away to a comfortable 21.12 (138) to 10.11 (71) win. However, after a mid season dip in form which saw them lose three games in a row by over six goals to the Sydney Swans (50 points), the Western Bulldogs (40 points) and the Adelaide Crows (57 points), coupled with late season losses to Melbourne and Richmond, St Kilda's finals chances were dismissed, eventually leading to the Saints finishing the season at 11th place on the ladder with 11 wins and 11 losses. 2017 also ended with the retirements of club greats [[Nick Riewoldt]] (336 games), [[Leigh Montagna]] (282 games) and [[Sean Dempster]] (222 games for Sydney and St Kilda).\n\nThe 2018 season saw a drastic fall in the club's form, as the Saints tumbled to 16th place on the ladder with four wins and a draw. Increased scrutiny on Richardson as coach saw the club bring experienced assistants [[Brett Ratten]] and [[Brendon Lade]] to Moorabbin, along with NRL legend [[Billy Slater]] in a leadership role. While 2019 started brightly with four wins from the first five games, the Saints eventually suffered a similar dip in form to the previous year, losing 9 of the next 11 matches. After being advised that his contract would not be renewed for 2020, coach [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] resigned from his position as senior coach. Ratten took over as caretaker coach and, after winning three of the season's last six games, was appointed permanent senior coach in September 2019.\n\n==== 2019-present: Ratten era ====\n{{Main|2020 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nDespite the coaching change, the Saints ended the 2019 season positively with four high-profile players requesting a trade to the Saints and many discussions held with other players looking to move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/saints-are-the-ones-to-watch-this-trade-period-20191008-p52ytz.html|title=Saints are the ones to watch this trade period|last=Niall|first=Jake|date=2019-10-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> During the trade period St Kilda traded a number of picks and acquired Port Adelaide's [[Dougal Howard]] and [[Paddy Ryder]], [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle's]] [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]], [[Zak Jones]] from [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond's]] [[Dan Butler (Australian footballer)|Dan Butler]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-10-15/saints-double-delight-power-pair-off-to-moorabbin|title=Saints' double delight: Power pair off to Moorabbin|website=afl.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/over-the-hill-saints-travel-acres-to-get-the-deal-done-20191016-p531dd.html|title=Over the Hill: Saints travel Acres to get the deal done|last=McClure|first=Sam|date=2019-10-16|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> [[Jack Steven]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Blake Acres]] were traded to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], [[Western Bulldogs]] and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Saints also added to their football department with former player Sean Dempster joining as a fitness coach, while former Hawthorn legend [[Jarryd Roughead]] as well as David Rath and [[Ben Robbins]] also moved to the club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saints.com.au/news/2019-09-19/saints-bolster-football-department|title=Saints bolster football department|website=saints.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Club identity==\nThe club's on-field nickname is the '''Saints''', usage of which dates back to as early as the 1870s.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The South Australian Advertiser|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=21 August 1877|page=7|title=Football}}</ref> Many clubs' early nicknames was derived from an abbreviation or demonym of the club's suburb, but St Kilda is unique among the AFL clubs in now utilising this as its official nickname.

In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, the players wore a thinly striped red, white and black jumper; the stripes were later widened. In 1915, St Kilda changed its colours to red, yellow and black, to avoid playing in the colours of the [[German Empire|German Empire's flag]] during a war against that country;<ref>{{cite news|title=Weekly Times|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121124670?searchTerm=%22st%20kilda%22%20%22yellow%22%20%22football%22&searchLimits=sortby=dateDesc|date=17 April 1915|pages=21}}</ref> in honour of allied power Belgium, they played in [[Flag of Belgium|its flag colours]] for the remainder of the First World War.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Australasian|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/142971657?searchTerm=%22st%20kilda%22%20%22yellow%22%20%22football%22&searchLimits=sortby=dateDesc|date=17 April 1915|page=26}}</ref> In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of red, white and black.\n\nThe St Kilda Football Club crest first appeared officially on the jumper in approximately 1933 after existing at the club for quite some time beforehand in basic design form. In 1953 the Saints' jumper took on a \"vest\" style of the three stripes; red, white and black on the front with the club crest, and a plain black back with white numbers \u2013 which is used today. The most common variation on that basic design through the years has been the ribbing area around the sleeves and neck having various alternative designs. For a period from 1997 to 2001, a stylised jumper based on the club crest itself was worn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footyjumpers.com |title=www.footyjumpers.com |publisher=www.footyjumpers.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Evolution====\nUniforms worn by St Kilda through its history:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footyjumpers.com/|title=History of VFL/AFL Jumpers|website=FootyJumpers.com}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _hoops_black|body= ffffff|shorts= 062A56|socks= ff0000|title= 1897\u20131909}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1910\u201314}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffcc00|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1915\u201318 }}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1919|pattern_so= _redtop|body= 000000|shorts= ffffff|socks= 000000|title= 1919\u201322}}\n|-\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1923|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1923\u201352}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1953\u201396}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1997|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1997\u20132001}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 2002\u2013present}}\n|}\n\nThe St Kilda jumper has three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest a plain black back with white ribbing and numbers.  The current club sponsors are Dare Iced Coffee & Pepper Money whose logos appear alternating on the front and back of the uniform for home and away games. The clash jumper is very distinct from the home jumper, bearing red, white and black vertical stripes with a white back.

The league did not use official club logos until approximately the 1970s. Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs and in some cases outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( or registered trademarks in some cases ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic design frame ( in the form of a badge or shield shape ) and had each club's individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post.\n\n====Club crest as the official logo====\nA logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest \u2013 which has been on the club jumper since it was first designed in the 1930s and was already an officially registered trade mark of the club \u2013 as the club's official logo in the league. The crest is an iconic feature of the club's jumper \u2013 a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club's motto, ''Fortius Quo Fidelius'', which is usually translated as \"Strength through loyalty\". As with the nickname \"Saints\" the club crest has no religious associations.\n\n===Club song===\nThe club song is an adaption of \"When The Saints Go Marching In\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/songs/saints.html |title=St Kilda Saints Club Song |publisher=Footy.com.au |date=28 April 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> The song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single.

When the club moved to Moorabbin Oval a popular chant called \"We are the Saints\" was sung by supporters. In the late 1960s \"When The Saints Go Marching In\" eventually became established as the club song.

The new facility was completed at a cost of approximately 9.5 million dollars and named the Linen House Centre under a naming rights sponsorship deal.\n\nIn 2019 the club relocated back to Moorabin Oval.\n\n===Moorabbin Oval redevelopment===\nMoorabbin Oval has undergone a two-stage redevelopment, costing approximately 30 million dollars, for the St Kilda Football Club.

As part of the development deal the parkland outside the outer side of the oval (behind the old terraces that were on the outer side of the ground) is no longer leased by St Kilda FC and has been released back to the local council. It will serve as the primary home ground for the [[Sandringham Dragons]] and the [[Southern Football League (Victoria)|Southern Football League]] as well as being the administrative centre for football development in the south-east.

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]] and, from 1992 to 1999, a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]]. St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new [[Victorian Football League]] in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2001, St Kilda entered a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliation]] with existing VFL club [[Springvale Football Club|Springvale]] (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed [[Casey Scorpions|Casey]] in 2006). Under the affiliation, reserves players for St Kilda played VFL football with Springvale/Casey. The affiliation ended after the 2008 season<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/saints-staying-in-seaford-despite-government-funding-at-moorabbin-20140503-zr3wi.html|title=Saints staying in Seaford despite government funding at Moorabbin|date=3 May 2014|accessdate=14 June 2014|author=Daniel Cherny|publication-place=Melbourne}}</ref> and St Kilda then entered an equivalent affiliation with [[Sandringham Football Club|Sandringham]] which it still maintains as of the 2019 season.<ref name=\"stksandy\">{{cite news|newspaper=Bayside Leader|author=Paul Amy|publication-place=City of Bayside, VIC|title=Sandringham and St Kilda to stay aligned until the end of the 2016 VFL season|date=19 August 2014|accessdate=9 March 2015|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/inner-south/sandringham-and-st-kilda-to-stay-aligned-until-the-end-of-the-2016-vfl-season/story-fngnvmn9-1227029011358}}</ref>\n\nSt Kilda had announced its intention to end its affiliation with Sandringham and re-establish its own reserves team in the VFL from the 2017 season after a redevelopment of [[Moorabbin Oval]] was completed;<ref name=\"stksandy\" /> but the club ultimately extended and expanded its affiliation with Sandringham.

The club also has strong links to the south-eastern suburb of [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], where it was based between 1965 and 2010.\n\nSt Kilda were a foundation team of the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1877 and later, in 1897, became a foundation team in the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), which later became known as the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990.<ref name=\"TheClubs\">{{cite book|title=The Clubs|editor-last1=Ross |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=Hutchinson |editor-first2=Garrie |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1998 |page=321|isbn=978-0-670-87858-1}}</ref> The Saints field teams in the [[AFL Women's]] and [[VFL Women's]] competitions, and are in an alignment with the [[Sandringham Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]].\n\nSt Kilda have won a single premiership to date, a famous one-point win in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final]].<ref>{{cite news| last=Gleeson | first=Michael | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/that-one-point-in-1966-as-never-seen-before/2009/09/02/1251570754023.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=That one point in 1966, as never seen before \u2013 RFNews \u2013 theage.com.au | date=3 September 2009}}</ref> St Kilda most recently won the [[List of AFL Minor Premiers|minor premiership]] in the [[2009 AFL season]]<ref name=\"stats.rleague.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/seas/2009.html#lad|title=2009 Season Scores and Results \u2013 Ladder|work=AFL Tables|accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref> and were grand finalists in [[2009 AFL Grand Final|2009]] and [[2010 AFL Grand Final|2010]].\n\nSt Kilda developed a reputation as perennial underachievers,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/two-saints-punting-on-a-different-path/2007/10/05/1191091366658.html \"Two Saints punting on a different path\"], ''The Age'', 6 October 2007.</ref> much of this attributed to their record of [[List of Australian Football League wooden spoons|finishing last]] more often than any other club in the league (27 times),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/St%20Kilda/12 |title=St Kilda |publisher=AustralianFootball.com |date= |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref> as well as having the second lowest all-time win percentage of any team still playing in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/allteams/overall_wl.html|title=Team Win-Loss Records|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{details|History of the St Kilda Football Club}}\n{{recentism|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1873\u20131915: Early years===\n\n====1873: Establishment====\nOn 14 March 1873 a meeting was held in Windsor to form the St Kilda Football Club.

They made their debut in an away game against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] on 8 May 1897, which they lost 2.4. (16) to 5.11. (41).\n\nThe club's home ground in the new league was the [[Junction Oval]] ( until 1964 ) in the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne and the club's first home game was against [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]]. The score was St Kilda 3.8. (26) to 10.6. (66).\n\nSt Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules For Dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p. 45</ref>\n\nIn 1902, [[Charlie Baker (footballer)|Charlie Baker]] became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.\n\n====1907: First finals series====\nSix successive wins at the start of the [[1907 VFL season|1907 season]] saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses.\n\nSt Kilda were beaten by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in [[1908 VFL season|1908]] and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points.\n\n====1913: First grand final====\n[[File:St kilda 1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|St Kilda squad for the 1913 Grand Final]]\nThe 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 grand final]] by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda \u2013 the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point \u2013 and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).\n\nDue to World War I the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49.\n\n===1918\u20131939: Between the wars===\n\n====1925: First Brownlow medallist====\n[[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\nThe following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and were eliminated once again by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals.\n\n====1930s====\nIn 1936, [[Bill Mohr]] became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season.\n\nBill Mohr kicked 101 goals in [[1936 VFL season|1936]] and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.\n\nThe mid-1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in [[1939 VFL season|1939]] by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.<ref name=\"saints.com.au\"/>  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final.\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nSt Kilda won three of the first four games early in the [[1940 VFL season|1940 season]] and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Although there were some prominent players like [[Harold Bray]], [[Keith Drinan]], [[Peter Bennett (footballer, born 1926)|Peter Bennett]] and later [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]], St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The [[1950 VFL season|1950 season]] saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956.\n\nIn 1956 [[Bill Young (Australian rules footballer)|Bill Young]] became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals.\n\n====1957\u20131959: Consecutive Brownlow medallists====\nIn 1957, [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]] became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.\n\nAlso in 1958, St Kilda won the [[1958 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series competition]], a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.\n\nIn 1959, [[Verdun Howell]] became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Howell had tied with [[Bob Skilton]] in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back \u2013 with Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively.\n\nIn 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach. St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] in the first semi-final.  The club finished ninth in [[1962 VFL season|1962]] with nine wins and nine losses.\n\nIn 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the [[1964 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series]] competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73).\n\nSt Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the [[1963 VFL season|1963 season]] to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. The club lost to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in the semi-finals.\n\n===1960\u20131973: Successful era===\n\n===Departure from the Junction Oval===\nBy the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club was seeking to move its playing base away from the [[Junction Oval]], frustrated by disputes and relationships with the [[St Kilda Cricket Club]]. In 1959, the club made enquiries about a 50-year lease to play at and develop [[Elsternwick Park]] in the neighbouring suburb of [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], but no deal was signed.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=4 April 1959|page=54|author=Jack Dunn|title=St Kilda to seek new home ground|publication-place=Melbourne}}</ref> In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its training and administrative base to the large [[Moorabbin Oval]] in Linton St, [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], approximately 10&nbsp;km south-east of St Kilda, starting from the [[1965 VFL season|1965 season]].<ref name=\"sun25mar\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=52|author=Jack Dunn|date=25 March 1964|title=Saints will move to Moorabbin in '65}}</ref> The club signed a 75-year lease in August 1964 for controlling occupancy of the venue, and established a social club on the site.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=56|author=Rex Pullen|date=5 August 1964|title=Saints given 75-yr. lease}}</ref> The move cost the local [[Moorabbin Football Club]] its place in the [[Victorian Football Association]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=20|author=Peter Stone|date=4 April 1964|title=V.F.A. suspends Moorabbin for season}}</ref>\n\nSt Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the [[Junction Oval]] was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], which St Kilda won 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#6 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> Its first home game at Moorabbin was a 6-point win over Collingwood 8.12 (60) d. 8.6 (54) in front of a crowd of 51,370, which is still the ground record for Moorabbin Oval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_moorabbin_oval.html|title=Moorabbin Oval - Attendances (1965\u20131992)|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1965: First minor premiership===\nSt Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history.\n\nSt Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the [[1965 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n[[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Stewart tied on votes with [[Noel Teasdale]] of [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and was awarded the 1965 Brownlow on a count-back.\n\n====1966: First premiership====\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1966 VFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | St Kilda || '''10''' || '''14''' || '''74'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || 10 || 13 || 73\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 101,655\n|}\n\n1966 saw St Kilda qualify for finals series in consecutive years for the first time since 1907\u201308. 14 wins and 4 losses in the home and away rounds qualified the club for the finals in second place.\n\nIan Stewart was the first St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1966 Brownlow Medal with 21 votes. The second consecutive year he won the league's highest individual award and the sixth Brownlow Medal won by a St Kilda player.\n\nSt Kilda were defeated by Collingwood in the second semi-final 15. 9. (99) to 13. 11. (89). The club progressed to the 1966 Grand Final after defeating Essendon in the preliminary final 15. 4. (94) to 7. 10. (52).\n\nSt Kilda went on to defeat Collingwood in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final]] 10.14 (74) to 10.13 (73), winning the club's first ever premiership.\n\n====Late 1960s====\nIn 1967, [[Ross G. Smith|Ross Smith]] became the sixth St Kilda player to win Brownlow Medal.  This was also the third consecutive year that a St Kilda player had won the Brownlow Medal and the second time in the club's history that they had Brownlow Medalists in three consecutive years.\n\nThe [[1968 VFL season|1968 season]] saw St Kilda qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. St Kilda were eliminated by Geelong in the first semi-final.\n\n====1970\u20131973: Consecutive finals series====\nA seventh place home and away season finish in [[1969 VFL season|1969]] was followed by another finals appearance in [[1970 VFL season|1970]], when St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated South Melbourne in the first semifinal and went on to be eliminated by eventual premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the preliminary final.\n\nSt Kilda qualified for the finals series in second place in [[1971 VFL season|1971]] at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins.  St Kilda was defeated by Hawthorn by two points in the second semifinal, defeated Richmond in the preliminary final and was defeated in the [[1971 VFL Grand Final]] by Hawthorn.\n\nThe club qualified for the finals series again in [[1972 VFL season|1972]] in fourth with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final and Collingwood in the first semifinal before being eliminated in the preliminary final by Carlton.\n\n[[1973 VFL season|1973]] saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth place with 12 wins.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final before being eliminated in the semifinals by Richmond.\n\n[[1974 VFL season|1974]] saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins.  The club failed to build on competitive seasons in [[1975 VFL season|1975]] and [[1976 VFL season|1976]]. Allan Jeans coaching career at St Kilda ended at the end of the 1976 season after 16 seasons.\n\n[[1978 VFL season|1978]] began and ended strongly, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. [[1979 VFL season|1979]] began well with a win over Hawthorn before a run of defeats and finishing a clear last.  Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.\n\nIn [[1987 VFL season|1987]], with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since [[1982 VFL season|1982]] with nine wins. Tony Lockett won the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading goalkicker in the home and away season, the fourth St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker award. Lockett became the second St Kilda player to kick more than 100 goals in a season (117).\n\nLockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the [[Brownlow Medal]]. He remains the only person in league history to win both the league's best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the league's leading goalkicker Coleman Medal award in the same season. Lockett also won St Kilda's best and fairest award, now called the [[Trevor Barker Award]], and the Leigh Matthews Trophy (players association most valuable player) in the same year. He is the only person in league history to win the Brownlow, Coleman, club best and fairest and Leigh Matthews Trophy in the same year in 1987.\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nThe league was officially renamed the [[Australian Football League]] prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.\n\nA competitive [[1991 AFL season]] saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the elimination final.\n\nTony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season in 1991, the first St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker twice.\n\nLockett's 118 goals in 1991 was the third year a St Kilda player had kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nIn a competitive [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]], St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. \nTony Lockett's 132 goals in 1992 was the fourth year a St Kilda player kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nSt Kilda won its first finals series match since 1973, over Collingwood, before being by eliminated from the 1992 finals series by Footscray in the semi-finals.\n\n====1992: Last home game at Moorabbin====\nThe AFL embarked on a strategy of grounds rationalisation in the early 1990s and, with Moorabbin Oval's facilities ageing, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to [[Waverley Park]] from 1993. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members and shareholders by a margin of 8750 to 6555 in July 1992.  The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL's grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club's debt.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=40|author=Patrick Smithers|date=14 July 1992|title=Saints vote for move to Waverley}}</ref> St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was the Round 20 match on 1 August 1992, an 18-point win over the Fitzroy Lions in front of 27,736.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#31 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> St Kilda Football Club retained Moorabbin Oval as a training, administration and entertainment venue.\n\n====1996: First pre-season cup win====\nSt Kilda won the [[1996 Ansett Australia Cup]] competition, the pre-season cup.

St Kilda finished second after being beaten in the [[1997 AFL Grand Final]] by Adelaide.\n\n====1998\u20132000====\nPrior to the start of the [[1998 AFL season|1998 season]], St Kilda progressed to the [[1998 Ansett Australia Cup]] final in which they were defeated by North Melbourne.\n\nSt Kilda made their best start to a season since 1972 by winning five out of six matches by Round 6. At the half-way mark of the 1998 season, St Kilda had jumped to top spot on the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses after defeating the Western Bulldogs in a top of the ladder clash at Waverley Park and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team's performance dramatically faded after going from second place in Round 17 to sixth at the home and away games conclusion in Round 22. During this period St Kilda defeated Geelong in Round 16 and West Coast in Round 21. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals. Consolation for the team's performance that year was Robert Harvey becoming the second St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1998 Brownlow Medal with 32 votes, the highest ever votes at the time. He would also be the second St Kilda player to win consecutive Brownlow Medals and the tenth St Kilda Brownlow Medalist.\n\n;1999 \u2013 Farewell to Waverley Park\nSt Kilda made a good start to the 1999 premiership season after progressing to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25-point loss to North Melbourne which ended their chance at a third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#28 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at [[Docklands Stadium]] (currently known by its sponsorship name as Marvel Stadium) whilst maintaining the club's training and administration headquarters at Moorabbin.\n\n===2000\u20132008: From wooden spoon to finals===\n\n====2000\u20132003====\nThe Saints struggled in the early part of this decade, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. They did not fare well in [[2001 AFL season|2001]] or [[2002 AFL season|2002]] either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as [[Justin Koschitzke]], [[Nick Riewoldt]], [[Nick Dal Santo]] and [[Brendon Goddard]], who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end.

ladder, just missing out on the finals for the first time since 2007.\n\n====2013\u20132019: Rebuilding under Watters and Richardson ====\n{{Main|2013 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nThe 2013 season marked a historic moment for the St Kilda Football Club and the AFL with the first home and away season match outside of Australia. The match was held in Wellington, New Zealand, on 25 April ([[Anzac Day]]), the day each year on which both Australia and New Zealand commemorate the soldiers from both countries who have fought in conflicts around the world.\n\nThe match began in the early evening and was held at Westpac Trust Stadium with the Saints hosting the Sydney Swans. The match was played in frigid and slippery conditions. The Saints lost the match by 16 points.\n\nIn Round 23, St Kilda hosted Fremantle in what would be the last game for three 200 game players, [[Stephen Milne]], [[Jason Blake (footballer)|Jason Blake]] and [[Justin Koschitzke]]. The Saints won by 71 points.\n\nSt Kilda won five matches for the year and finished 16th on the ladder. On 1 November, senior coach [[Scott Watters]] was sacked. On 14 November, former Port Adelaide director of coaching [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] was announced as new senior coach for the next three years. In the off-season, the Saints trading negotiations resulted in the arrival of [[Shane Savage]], [[Luke Delaney]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Billy Longer]], while also picking up draft picks 3, 18 and 19, which were used to take [[Jack Billings]], [[Luke Dunstan]] and Blake Acres respectively.\n\nSt Kilda began 2014 under new coach Richardson with a 17-point win over favourites Melbourne. They followed this with a win over the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] to start the season 2-0 for the first time since 2010. After a close loss to West Coast and a heavy defeat to Adelaide, the Saints managed to upset top eight favourites Essendon by 16 points. Following this, the Saints lost the next 11 games, including losses by over 80 points to Hawthorn, Collingwood, Geelong and Carlton. On 15 July, [[Lenny Hayes]] announced that he would retire at the end of the 2014 season. The following weekend, the Saints beat Fremantle by 58 points at Etihad Stadium in the upset of the season. The Saints then lost the remaining five games to end the season with 4 wins and 18 losses as well as their first wooden spoon since 2000. With pick one in the draft, St Kilda selected key forward [[Patrick McCartin]].\n\nIn 2015, the club still struggled to compete with the higher echelons of the competition, however, the team still showed its potential with an eleven-goal comeback against the Western Bulldogs a particular highlight, as well as the emergence of key forward [[Josh Bruce]], who finished the year with 50 goals. 2016 saw the club begin to challenge for the top 8, however despite gaining twelve wins (including victories against Geelong and eventual premiers the Western Bulldogs) and the continued development of the club's young stars, St Kilda finished ninth on the AFL ladder, missing the finals on percentage.\n\nIn 2017, St Kilda once again challenged for a spot in the top 8, highlighted by their Round 16 victory over eventual premiers Richmond, in which they recorded an 82-point margin at half time, leading 14.8 (92) to 1.4 (10) before running away to a comfortable 21.12 (138) to 10.11 (71) win. However, after a mid season dip in form which saw them lose three games in a row by over six goals to the Sydney Swans (50 points), the Western Bulldogs (40 points) and the Adelaide Crows (57 points), coupled with late season losses to Melbourne and Richmond, St Kilda's finals chances were dismissed, eventually leading to the Saints finishing the season at 11th place on the ladder with 11 wins and 11 losses. 2017 also ended with the retirements of club greats [[Nick Riewoldt]] (336 games), [[Leigh Montagna]] (282 games) and [[Sean Dempster]] (222 games for Sydney and St Kilda).\n\nThe 2018 season saw a drastic fall in the club's form, as the Saints tumbled to 16th place on the ladder with four wins and a draw. Increased scrutiny on Richardson as coach saw the club bring experienced assistants [[Brett Ratten]] and [[Brendon Lade]] to Moorabbin, along with NRL legend [[Billy Slater]] in a leadership role. While 2019 started brightly with four wins from the first five games, the Saints eventually suffered a similar dip in form to the previous year, losing 9 of the next 11 matches. After being advised that his contract would not be renewed for 2020, coach [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] resigned from his position as senior coach. Ratten took over as caretaker coach and, after winning three of the season's last six games, was appointed permanent senior coach in September 2019.\n\n==== 2019-present: Ratten era ====\n{{Main|2020 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nDespite the coaching change, the Saints ended the 2019 season positively with four high-profile players requesting a trade to the Saints and many discussions held with other players looking to move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/saints-are-the-ones-to-watch-this-trade-period-20191008-p52ytz.html|title=Saints are the ones to watch this trade period|last=Niall|first=Jake|date=2019-10-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> During the trade period St Kilda traded a number of picks and acquired Port Adelaide's [[Dougal Howard]] and [[Paddy Ryder]], [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle's]] [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]], [[Zak Jones]] from [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond's]] [[Dan Butler (Australian footballer)|Dan Butler]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-10-15/saints-double-delight-power-pair-off-to-moorabbin|title=Saints' double delight: Power pair off to Moorabbin|website=afl.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/over-the-hill-saints-travel-acres-to-get-the-deal-done-20191016-p531dd.html|title=Over the Hill: Saints travel Acres to get the deal done|last=McClure|first=Sam|date=2019-10-16|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> [[Jack Steven]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Blake Acres]] were traded to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], [[Western Bulldogs]] and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Saints also added to their football department with former player Sean Dempster joining as a fitness coach, while former Hawthorn legend [[Jarryd Roughead]] as well as David Rath and [[Ben Robbins]] also moved to the club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saints.com.au/news/2019-09-19/saints-bolster-football-department|title=Saints bolster football department|website=saints.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Club identity==\nThe club's on-field nickname is the '''Saints''', usage of which dates back to as early as the 1870s.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The South Australian Advertiser|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=21 August 1877|page=7|title=Football}}</ref> Many clubs' early nicknames was derived from an abbreviation or demonym of the club's suburb, but St Kilda is unique among the AFL clubs in now utilising this as its official nickname.

In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, the players wore a thinly striped red, white and black jumper; the stripes were later widened. In 1915, St Kilda changed its colours to red, yellow and black, to avoid playing in the colours of the [[German Empire|German Empire's flag]] during a war against that country;<ref>{{cite news|title=Weekly Times|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121124670?searchTerm=%22st%20kilda%22%20%22yellow%22%20%22football%22&searchLimits=sortby=dateDesc|date=17 April 1915|pages=21}}</ref> in honour of allied power Belgium, they played in [[Flag of Belgium|its flag colours]] for the remainder of the First World War.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Australasian|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/142971657?searchTerm=%22st%20kilda%22%20%22yellow%22%20%22football%22&searchLimits=sortby=dateDesc|date=17 April 1915|page=26}}</ref> In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of red, white and black.\n\nThe St Kilda Football Club crest first appeared officially on the jumper in approximately 1933 after existing at the club for quite some time beforehand in basic design form. In 1953 the Saints' jumper took on a \"vest\" style of the three stripes; red, white and black on the front with the club crest, and a plain black back with white numbers \u2013 which is used today. The most common variation on that basic design through the years has been the ribbing area around the sleeves and neck having various alternative designs. For a period from 1997 to 2001, a stylised jumper based on the club crest itself was worn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footyjumpers.com |title=www.footyjumpers.com |publisher=www.footyjumpers.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Evolution====\nUniforms worn by St Kilda through its history:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footyjumpers.com/|title=History of VFL/AFL Jumpers|website=FootyJumpers.com}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _hoops_black|body= ffffff|shorts= 062A56|socks= ff0000|title= 1897\u20131909}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1910\u201314}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffcc00|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1915\u201318 }}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1919|pattern_so= _redtop|body= 000000|shorts= ffffff|socks= 000000|title= 1919\u201322}}\n|-\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1923|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1923\u201352}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1953\u201396}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1997|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1997\u20132001}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 2002\u2013present}}\n|}\n\nThe St Kilda jumper has three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest a plain black back with white ribbing and numbers.

The league did not use official club logos until approximately the 1970s. Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs and in some cases outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( or registered trademarks in some cases ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic design frame ( in the form of a badge or shield shape ) and had each club's individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post.\n\n====Club crest as the official logo====\nA logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest \u2013 which has been on the club jumper since it was first designed in the 1930s and was already an officially registered trade mark of the club \u2013 as the club's official logo in the league. The crest is an iconic feature of the club's jumper \u2013 a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club's motto, ''Fortius Quo Fidelius'', which is usually translated as \"Strength through loyalty\". As with the nickname \"Saints\" the club crest has no religious associations.\n\n===Club song===\nThe club song is an adaption of \"When The Saints Go Marching In\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/songs/saints.html |title=St Kilda Saints Club Song |publisher=Footy.com.au |date=28 April 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> The song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single.

As part of the development deal the parkland outside the outer side of the oval (behind the old terraces that were on the outer side of the ground) is no longer leased by St Kilda FC and has been released back to the local council. It will serve as the primary home ground for the [[Sandringham Dragons]] and the [[Southern Football League (Victoria)|Southern Football League]] as well as being the administrative centre for football development in the south-east.

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]] and, from 1992 to 1999, a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]]. St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new [[Victorian Football League]] in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2001, St Kilda entered a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliation]] with existing VFL club [[Springvale Football Club|Springvale]] (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed [[Casey Scorpions|Casey]] in 2006).
