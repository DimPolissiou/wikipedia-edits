Marvis was at ringside for all of his father's fights after the second [[Oscar Bonavena]] bout in December 1968, including the great battles with [[Muhammad Ali]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99084418/ Ring links Frazier and son], ''Detroit Free Press'', April 20, 1979, p. 32.</ref> Marvis [[exhibition fight|exhibited]] four rounds with his father in [[Rochester, New York]], on December 3, 1976, and staged another exhibition in 1977.) His sister [[Jackie Frazier-Lyde]] was also a professional boxer, as was his brother Joe Frazier, Jr. (a.k.a. Hector Frazier). Marvis lived with his family in a 16-room stone split-level home in [[Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania|Whitemarsh]].<ref name=\"Ronberg\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/173073150/ Being Joe Frazier's son hasn't turned his head] by Gary Ronberg, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', August 8, 1978, 5-C.</ref>\n\nMarvis was involved in other sports, but finally gave it all up in favor of boxing, \"I played football and basketball and I wrestled, and I love them all, especially football. I was a running back. When I was in ninth grade, Duke and Temple talked to me about going there. But I fell so much in love with boxing. I gave up the other sports. Once I get into a sport. I dedicate myself to it. I don't believe in concentrating on more than one thing,\" Marvis Frazier said on his choice of boxing.

He was the 1979 National Golden Gloves Heavyweight Champion and 1980 National AAU Heavyweight Champion.  He was coached partly by his father, and in part by [[George Benton|Georgie Benton]] and Val Colbert. \"My dad tried not to play too active a role in my career for fear of putting pressure on me,\" Marvis said.<ref name=\"AlbuquerqueJournal\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156245687/ Marvis Frazier Chases Gold] (AP,) ''Albuquerque Journal'', January 28, 1979, E-8.</ref><ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/436752059/ Frazier], ''The Boston Globe'', April 27, 1979, p. 77.</ref> Benton said that Marvis was a model kid.

He goes to choir practice Monday nights, Bible study Wednesday nights and church on Sunday. He doesn't smoke, drink or run around.

Pitted against Holmes after just ten pro bouts (all victories), Frazier's camp touted his speed and youth as significant advantages over the champion. During the first minute of the fight Frazier dropped his hands to his sides and playfully moved his head back and forth, taunting Holmes: ill-advised behavior against an experienced veteran. Just 2:06 in, Holmes floored Frazier with a long right hand, knocking him down; Marvis took an eight-count and got back up. Dazed by the blow, Frazier was a sitting target and Holmes followed up, appealing for the referee to step in as he pummelled the younger man on the ropes. Finally, the referee stopped the bout with just a few seconds left in the first round, awarding Holmes a [[technical knockout]]. Many in the sports press criticized father/trainer [[Joe Frazier]] for changing his son's style from that of an out-fighter (which brought Marvis success as an amateur) to an in-fighter, which many thought did not suit Marvis.\n\nAfter his loss to Holmes, Frazier continued to fight and won his next six bouts, including victories over future world cruiserweight champion [[Bernard Benton]], heavyweight contenders Jose Ribalta and [[James Tillis|James \"Quick\" Tillis]], and future champion [[James Smith (boxer)|James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith]]. With the exception of a first-round knockout in his first fight after losing to Holmes, all of Frazier's fights went the full ten round distance with him winning unanimous or [[majority decision]]s in each fight.\n\nThis set up the fight with the 24\u20130 Tyson, which was broadcast live from the [[Glens Falls Civic Center]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Frazier quickly proved to be no match for the future champion as Tyson came out firing. Fifteen seconds into the fight, Tyson scored with a huge uppercut that knocked Frazier senseless and hit him with a combination as Frazier slumped to the canvas unconscious. Referee [[Joe Cortez]] started to count while looking at Frazier, but immediately waved off the fight once he saw that Frazier was out cold. The bout only lasted thirty seconds, which proved to be Tyson's quickest knockout of his career.\n\nRecalling the fight in later years, Marvis Frazier conceded that he had underestimated the young Mike Tyson, who had not yet won the first of his world titles. \"Tyson was just another guy who was going to be a statistic. Yeah, that's what I thought. I threw a jab and that's all I remember.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/123935-marvis-frazier-never-won-title-but-has-no-regrets|title=Marvis Frazier never won title but has no regrets|newspaper=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]|author=Dettloff, William|date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter Tyson, Frazier did not fight for a title again. After nearly a year away from the ring following the loss to Tyson, Frazier returned to fight twice in two months, winning both of his bouts over journeymen fighters. He won his final fight against Phillipp Brown in 1988, retiring with a career record of 19\u20132.\n\n==Retirement and later life==\nAfter retiring from boxing, he became an ordained minister and

son of former heavyweight champion and Hall of Famer, [[Joe Frazier]]. Marvis was at ringside for all of his father's fights after the second [[Oscar Bonavena]] bout in December 1968, including the great battles with [[Muhammad Ali]].<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99084418/ Ring links Frazier and son], ''Detroit Free Press'', April 20, 1979, p. 32.</ref> Marvis [[exhibition fight|exhibited]] four rounds with his father in [[Rochester, New York]], on December 3, 1976, and staged another exhibition in 1977.) His sister [[Jackie Frazier-Lyde]] was also a professional boxer, as was his brother Joe Frazier, Jr. (a.k.a. Hector Frazier). Marvis lived with his family in a 16-room stone split-level home in [[Whitemarsh Township, Pennsylvania|Whitemarsh]].<ref name=\"Ronberg\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/173073150/ Being Joe Frazier's son hasn't turned his head] by Gary Ronberg, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', August 8, 1978, 5-C.</ref>\n\nMarvis was involved in other sports, but finally gave it all up in favor of boxing, \"I played football and basketball and I wrestled, and I love them all, especially football. I was a running back. When I was in ninth grade, Duke and Temple talked to me about going there. But I fell so much in love with boxing. I gave up the other sports. Once I get into a sport. I dedicate myself to it. I don't believe in concentrating on more than one thing,\" Marvis Frazier said on his choice of boxing. He graduated from [[Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School]] in suburban Philadelphia<ref name=\"Pepe\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/483761624/ Second generation] by Phil Pepe, ''Daily News from New York'', April 9, 1979, p. 278.</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nMarvis was a highly touted prospect and among the top-ranked amateur heavyweights. He was the 1979 National Golden Gloves Heavyweight Champion and 1980 National AAU Heavyweight Champion.  He was coached partly by his father, and in part by [[George Benton|Georgie Benton]] and Val Colbert. \"My dad tried not to play too active a role in my career for fear of putting pressure on me,\" Marvis said.<ref name=\"AlbuquerqueJournal\">[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156245687/ Marvis Frazier Chases Gold] (AP,) ''Albuquerque Journal'', January 28, 1979, E-8.</ref><ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/436752059/ Frazier], ''The Boston Globe'', April 27, 1979, p. 77.</ref> Benton said that Marvis was a model kid. He grew up \"like he was poor\". According to Benton, \"there were no favors. When the grass on the Fraziers' two-and-a-half acre plot needed cutting, Marvis did it. With a hand mower. He goes to choir practice Monday nights, Bible study Wednesday nights and church on Sunday. He doesn't smoke, drink or run around. Not because such strictures are demanded of him, but because that's the way he is boxing or no boxing.\"<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/190342484/ Smokin' Joe has a fightin' son] by Alan Greenberg (The Los Awles Times,) ''The Minneapolis Star'', April 17, 1979, 12C.</ref>\n\nHis amateur debut came in March 4, 1977, age 16, with a [[unanimous decision]] victory over [[David Bey]] in Philadelphia.<ref>[https://newspaperarchive.com/syracuse-herald-journal-mar-04-1977-p-22/ Boxing], ''Syracuse Herald'', March 4, 1977, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn February 1979, Frazier was ranked #2 U.S. amateur heavyweight by the U.S. Amateur Boxers and Coaches Association,<ref>[https://newspaperarchive.com/galveston-daily-news-feb-15-1979-p-59/ Amateur Boxing Rankings] (UPI,) ''Galveston Daily News'', February 15, 1979, p. 59</ref> and #1 by the [[Amateur Athletic Union]].<ref name=\"AlbuquerqueJournal\" /> Frazier was a runner-up for the [[1979 Pan American Games]],<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16216132/may_30_1979/ Frazier in trials] by Mike Withiam, ''The Ithaca Journal'', May 30, 1979, p. 13.</ref> where he was expected to meet [[Te\u00f3filo Stevenson]] for the first time in this competition.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/214108830/ Like father, like son, this Frazier punching for gold medal] by Red Smith (N.Y.

Frazier said of this experience:\n{{quote|Me, I love flying, but my father is the man of the house and he gave me an order not to go.

Wait until he matures and develops a man's strength,\" Benton said.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/398946359/ Marvis Frazier: The Evolution Of Another Champion] by Alan Greenberg (The Los Awles Times,) ''The Atlanta Constitution'', April 21, 1979, 3-C.</ref> Benton, predicted Marvis Frazier will be \"the greatest heavyweight since Joe Louis.\"<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/482572447/ The best since the Brown Bomber?] by Larry Wood, ''Calgary Herald'', May 12, 1979, A1.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nAs a professional, Frazier is best remembered for two fights, unfortunately both first-round knockout losses: to champion [[Larry Holmes]] (a TKO) in 1983 and a rising [[Mike Tyson]] in 1986 (a KO). Pitted against Holmes after just ten pro bouts (all victories), Frazier's camp touted his speed and youth as significant advantages over the champion. During the first minute of the fight Frazier dropped his hands to his sides and playfully moved his head back and forth, taunting Holmes: ill-advised behavior against an experienced veteran. Just 2:06 in, Holmes floored Frazier with a long right hand, knocking him down; Marvis took an eight-count and got back up. Dazed by the blow, Frazier was a sitting target and Holmes followed up, appealing for the referee to step in as he pummelled the younger man on the ropes. Finally, the referee stopped the bout with just a few seconds left in the first round, awarding Holmes a [[technical knockout]]. Many in the sports press criticized father/trainer [[Joe Frazier]] for changing his son's style from that of an out-fighter (which brought Marvis success as an amateur) to an in-fighter, which many thought did not suit Marvis.\n\nAfter his loss to Holmes, Frazier continued to fight and won his next six bouts, including victories over future world cruiserweight champion [[Bernard Benton]], heavyweight contenders Jose Ribalta and [[James Tillis|James \"Quick\" Tillis]], and future champion [[James Smith (boxer)|James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith]]. With the exception of a first-round knockout in his first fight after losing to Holmes, all of Frazier's fights went the full ten round distance with him winning unanimous or [[majority decision]]s in each fight.\n\nThis set up the fight with the 24\u20130 Tyson, which was broadcast live from the [[Glens Falls Civic Center]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Frazier quickly proved to be no match for the future champion as Tyson came out firing. Fifteen seconds into the fight, Tyson scored with a huge uppercut that knocked Frazier senseless and hit him with a combination as Frazier slumped to the canvas unconscious. Referee [[Joe Cortez]] started to count while looking at Frazier, but immediately waved off the fight once he saw that Frazier was out cold. The bout only lasted thirty seconds, which proved to be Tyson's quickest knockout of his career.\n\nRecalling the fight in later years, Marvis Frazier conceded that he had underestimated the young Mike Tyson, who had not yet won the first of his world titles. \"Tyson was just another guy who was going to be a statistic. Yeah, that's what I thought. I threw a jab and that's all I remember.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/123935-marvis-frazier-never-won-title-but-has-no-regrets|title=Marvis Frazier never won title but has no regrets|newspaper=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]|author=Dettloff, William|date=July 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter Tyson, Frazier did not fight for a title again. After nearly a year away from the ring following the loss to Tyson, Frazier returned to fight twice in two months, winning both of his bouts over journeymen fighters. He won his final fight against Phillipp Brown in 1988, retiring with a career record of 19\u20132.\n\n==Retirement and later life==\nAfter retiring from boxing, he became an ordained minister and active participant in [[Prison Fellowship Ministries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.operationstartingline.net/Bio.asp?ID%3D2327 |editor=Jones, Brent |date=April 19, 2007 |title='Smokin' Joe' Frazier dropping suit against daughter |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014055858/http://www.operationstartingline.net/Bio.asp?ID=2327 |archivedate=October 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 Marvis completed his autobiography, ''Meet Marvis Frazier: The Story of the Son of Smokin' Joe'', with co-author Jamie Potter.\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{s-start}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=8|'''19 Wins''' (8 knockouts, 11 decisions), '''2 Losses''' (2 knockouts)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid;
