The building consists of 15 floors\u201413 levels with 2 basement floors. The buildingq is of RCC-framed construction designed for central air conditioning, designed in the shape of well-proportioned box with strip glass fa\u00e7ade. The air conditioning plant is in the sub-basement floor. The top floor of the building reaches a height of 44 meters, and the total height of the building is 177 feet.<ref name=\"ReachingTheSky\"/> The building occupies 52,800 sq ft.<ref name=\"HinduArchive_BornAmidCloudySkies\">{{Cite news \n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = When India's 'tallest building' was born amid cloudy skies\n  | newspaper = The Hindu (originally published 24 August 1959)\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = \n  | date = 25 August 2017\n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/when-indias-tallest-building-was-born-amid-cloudy-skies/article19558662.ece\n  | accessdate = 1 October 2017}}</ref> The total floor area of the building is 1,26,000 sq ft. The building stands on 521 [[pneumatic caisson]] piles that run to a depth of 35&nbsp;ft below the ground. The building was built at a cost of {{INR}} 8.7&nbsp;million in 1959. The building consumed about 26,000 sq ft of special glass that was treated with [[infra-red]] rays, stove enameled, and made water resistant with synthetic [[enamel paint]]. About 1,000 tons of [[steel]] and 3,000 tons of [[cement]] were used in the construction of the building.<ref name=\"ReachingTheSky\"/> The building could provide modern office accommodation for over 1,500 persons, and was built with five automatic lifts.<ref name=\"HinduArchive_BornAmidCloudySkies\"/>\n\n;Fire-fighting design\nAs fire fighting arrangement, the building has one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid hose reels as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the hose reels, there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located at one end of the building going up to the roof\u2014one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of [[galvanization|galvanised]] iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.<ref name=\"LICFire\"/>\n\n;Energy-saving design\nThe building has concrete walls on the eastern and western sides, preventing sun rays from penetrating the building during sunrise and sunset and keeping the temperature inside the building stable, and glass windows on the southern and northern sides. Owing to this design, the glass windows provide enough lighting without heating up the building.<ref name=\"DC_ATallLandMark\"/>\n\n==Incidents==\nOn 11 July 1975, a major fire incident occurred in the building.<ref name=\"ENVIS_Monograph\">{{Cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Monograph on Fire Hazard: Fire Hazards in Metro Cities of India\n  | work = Fire Hazards in Metro Cities of India\n  | publisher = ENVIS Centre on Human Settlements\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.spaenvis.nic.in/pdfs/monographs/fire-hazard.pdf\n  | format = pdf\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 8 Oct 2011\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928183807/http://www.spaenvis.nic.in/pdfs/monographs/fire-hazard.pdf\n  | archive-date = 28 September 2011\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref> The fire was first observed on the first floor at about 8.00 pm local time, and it spread rapidly to the floors above through several vertical openings and shafts. The incident necessitated deployment of the entire fire fighting resources of the city, including units from the [[Chennai Port Trust]], refineries, and so on. The operations continued overnight and concluded at about 6.00 pm the following day. During the initial stages, the fire-fighting operations were seriously hampered due to falling splinters of glass, burning fragments and molten metal from window frames made of aluminum. In addition, heavy sea breeze aided the rapid spread of fire. As the city hydrants had paucity of water, the fire-fighting operations mostly depended upon the fleet of water lorries provided by the [[Corporation of Chennai]] which were utilized for relaying water from the [[Cooum river]] which was about 0.5&nbsp;km away. Although there was no reported loss of life, some members of the fire service unit sustained injuries. From the second floor upwards, all the floors were severely damaged due to the fire. In the upper floors, there was nothing left except the charred and twisted steel furniture. However, the basement housing the IBM machine and air-conditioning plant, the ground floor and the first floor were saved. Some of the upper floors were seen to have developed cracks on the walls and columns. Since the structural stability of the building was in doubt, the building remained out of use for a long time until it was inspected by experts and got repaired. The fire was thought to have originated from some waste materials at the bottom of the vertical shafts. The LIC Building fire had led to focus the existing shortcomings and inadequacies in the design and the state of fire protection of multi-storied buildings in India, and helped in formulating comprehensive recommendations for strengthening fire-protection measures for such high-rise buildings.

Although the construction was commenced in 1953, the architects withdrew in 1957; the rest of the construction was overseen by Chennai-based architect L. M. Chitale. The building was constructed by the Murugappa Group's Coromandel Engineering. However, Chidambaram died in an air-crash in Singapore on 13 March 1954, when the building was still under construction.<ref name=\"VSriram_InLICShadow\"/> Much of the raw materials for the building were brought from England.<ref name=\"DC_ATallLandMark\"/> When insurance was nationalised in 1956, the government took over the building's construction, and the height of the building was reduced to 14 floors.

The building consists of 15 floors\u201413 levels with 2 basement floors. The buildingq is of RCC-framed construction designed for central air conditioning, designed in the shape of well-proportioned box with strip glass fa\u00e7ade. The air conditioning plant is in the sub-basement floor. The top floor of the building reaches a height of 44 meters, and the total height of the building is 177 feet.<ref name=\"ReachingTheSky\"/> The building occupies 52,800 sq ft.<ref name=\"HinduArchive_BornAmidCloudySkies\">{{Cite news \n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = When India's 'tallest building' was born amid cloudy skies\n  | newspaper = The Hindu (originally published 24 August 1959)\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = \n  | date = 25 August 2017\n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/when-indias-tallest-building-was-born-amid-cloudy-skies/article19558662.ece\n  | accessdate = 1 October 2017}}</ref> The total floor area of the building is 1,26,000 sq ft. The building stands on 521 [[pneumatic caisson]] piles that run to a depth of 35&nbsp;ft below the ground. The building was built at a cost of {{INR}} 8.7&nbsp;million in 1959. The building consumed about 26,000 sq ft of special glass that was treated with [[infra-red]] rays, stove enameled, and made water resistant with synthetic [[enamel paint]]. About 1,000 tons of [[steel]] and 3,000 tons of [[cement]] were used in the construction of the building.<ref name=\"ReachingTheSky\"/> The building could provide modern office accommodation for over 1,500 persons, and was built with five automatic lifts.<ref name=\"HinduArchive_BornAmidCloudySkies\"/>\n\n;Fire-fighting design\nAs fire fighting arrangement, the building has one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid hose reels as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the hose reels, there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located at one end of the building going up to the roof\u2014one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of [[galvanization|galvanised]] iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.<ref name=\"LICFire\"/>\n\n;Energy-saving design\nThe building has concrete walls on the eastern and western sides, preventing sun rays from penetrating the building during sunrise and sunset and keeping the temperature inside the building stable, and glass windows on the southern and northern sides. Owing to this design, the glass windows provide enough lighting without heating up the building.<ref name=\"DC_ATallLandMark\"/>\n\n==Incidents==\nOn 11 July 1975, a major fire incident occurred in the building.<ref name=\"ENVIS_Monograph\">{{Cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Monograph on Fire Hazard: Fire Hazards in Metro Cities of India\n  | work = Fire Hazards in Metro Cities of India\n  | publisher = ENVIS Centre on Human Settlements\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.spaenvis.nic.in/pdfs/monographs/fire-hazard.pdf\n  | format = pdf\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 8 Oct 2011\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928183807/http://www.spaenvis.nic.in/pdfs/monographs/fire-hazard.pdf\n  | archive-date = 28 September 2011\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref> The fire was first observed on the first floor at about 8.00 pm local time, and it spread rapidly to the floors above through several vertical openings and shafts. The incident necessitated deployment of the entire fire fighting resources of the city, including units from the [[Chennai Port Trust]], refineries, and so on. The operations continued overnight and concluded at about 6.00 pm the following day. During the initial stages, the fire-fighting operations were seriously hampered due to falling splinters of glass, burning fragments and molten metal from window frames made of aluminum. In addition, heavy sea breeze aided the rapid spread of fire. As the city hydrants had paucity of water, the fire-fighting operations mostly depended upon the fleet of water lorries provided by the [[Corporation of Chennai]] which were utilized for relaying water from the [[Cooum river]] which was about 0.5&nbsp;km away. Although there was no reported loss of life, some members of the fire service unit sustained injuries. From the second floor upwards, all the floors were severely damaged due to the fire. In the upper floors, there was nothing left except the charred and twisted steel furniture. However, the basement housing the IBM machine and air-conditioning plant, the ground floor and the first floor were saved. Some of the upper floors were seen to have developed cracks on the walls and columns. Since the structural stability of the building was in doubt, the building remained out of use for a long time until it was inspected by experts and got repaired. The fire was thought to have originated from some waste materials at the bottom of the vertical shafts. The LIC Building fire had led to focus the existing shortcomings and inadequacies in the design and the state of fire protection of multi-storied buildings in India, and helped in formulating comprehensive recommendations for strengthening fire-protection measures for such high-rise buildings. The total loss was estimated to be {{INR}}50&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"LICFire\">{{Cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = LIC Building Fire, Chennai\n  | work = \n  | publisher = Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Service\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.tnfrs.tn.nic.in/major-incid.htm#lic-bldg\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 8 Oct 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LIC Chennai.JPG|290px|thumbnail|right|LIC building at night]]\nOn 15 June 2009, the building received a bomb threat in the evening, which later turned to be a hoax.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Bomb hoax at LIC building \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher =\n  | date = 16 June 2009 \n  | url = http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/16/stories/2009061658760300.htm\n  | accessdate = 8 Apr 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, a crack developed on the eleventh floor of the building, which has been attributed to [[Chennai Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] work.

Towering above and beyond our roughly-built house was a mountain called Glenumra, over 3,000 feet in height, whilst in front was Muelhrae, or King of the Irish Mountains (as it is the loftiest), and a part of it effectually concealed from us all the glories of the setting sun. The humid nature of the soil was favourable to the growth of plants. I designed and laid out large gardens, and had only to insert a few feet or inches, as the case might be, of laurel, fuchsia, veronica, or hydrangia into the ground, and the slips took root, grew and flourished.

It was formally established by incorporation on 11 April 1946 under the [[List of Acts of the Oireachtas|National Stud Act, 1945]] and is owned by the [[Irish Government]].\n\n==History==\nThe Japanese Gardens at Tully were created between the years 1906\u20131910. They were devised by [[William Walker, 1st Baron Wavertree|Colonel William Hall-Walker (later Lord Wavertree)]], a wealthy Scotsman of a famous brewery family, and laid out by Japanese craftsman Tassa Eida and his son Minoru. Tassa, his wife and two sons lived at Curragh House, now the [[Racing Academy and Centre of Education|Racing Apprentice Centre of Education]].  Tassa remained at Tully until 1911 when he and his family moved to London to create another garden. Tassa Eida died in 1912 on his intended return journey to Japan and no more was heard of him or his family until Brian Eida, a son of Minoru, turned up as a tourist in the late 1980s to admire the work of his grandfather Tassa.\n\nThe name [[Minoru (horse)|Minoru]], which means 'light of my eye' or the 'favourite one', was chosen by Colonel Hall-Walker for his favourite Tully-bred colt. When leased to King Edward VII for his racing career, the colt Minoru carried the royal colours to victory in the Derby of 1909 to joyous cheers of \"Good Old Teddy!\"\n\nIn 1915, Colonel Hall-Walker departed to England, presenting his entire Tully property to \"The Nation.\" His Stud Farm became the British National Stud and the Japanese Gardens entered a period of relative obscurity until 1945. In that year (Tully properties having returned to the Irish Government in 1943) the Irish National Stud Company was formed. In the following year, 1946, after a gap of 34 years, the Japanese Gardens got a horticultural supervisor.\n\n==Attractions==\n\n===The Stud===\nGuided tours are available at the visitor centre.\n\n===The Japanese Gardens===\nThe Gardens, planned to symbolise the 'Life of Man', are now of international renown and are acclaimed as the finest Japanese Gardens in Europe.\n\nThe gardens at Tully are a living monument to the meeting of Eastern and Western cultures in a Western setting. The symbolism of life the garden portrays traces the journey of a soul from Oblivion to Eternity and the human experience of its embodiment as it journeys by paths of its own choice through life. Typical ambitions toward education, marriage, or a contemplative or carefree life, achievement, happy old age and a gateway to Eternity are portrayed. Furthermore, as an example of Japanese Gardening of its period, it is perfect \u2013 a Japanese Garden with a hint of Anglicisation about it, was precisely the type of garden being made in Japan at that time.\n\nThe journey starts at the gateway from oblivion, through which the pilgrim soul enters among the trees and passes into the open where is a small cavern, the cave of birth, crowned by a cherry tree. Here a short winding sunken path symbolises the years of Childhood, unseeing and unknowing, whence we come to a mound of rock.\nThrough this the tunnelled pathway leads from the darkness into the light from ignorance to the unfolding knowledge. Half way through the winding is an opening leading to steps to the hill of learning crowded by an ancient fir tree. Often this fir crowned height tempts the student to look too high but there is an unguarded hole to teach him vigilance before he comes down the hill to the level of his fellows.\nFollowing the winding course still guarded by rocks he reaches the parting of the ways. On the right ambition on the left is the straight path of austere living in the centre is the path to wedded life by which the pilgrim reaches the tiny island of joy and wonder, across the stepping stones of exploration. But he cannot stay there.\nAll paths lead to further temptation across a stone bridge to the bamboo bridge and the geisha house but beyond them is the hill of ambition and the well of wisdom is in sight across the beautiful water.\nVery steep is the hill and those who climb may be separated but as they climb they reach out a helping hands and are united at the top. Descending the pilgrim finds an easy bridge across the roaring falls and treads the stepping stones through the level garden of lease and contentment to the hill of mourning where his soul goes forth through the gate of eternity.\n\n===St. Fiachra's Garden===\nTo celebrate the Millennium, this garden was opened in 1999 and commemorates the Patron Saint of Gardeners [[Saint Fiacre|St. Fiachra or Fiacre]].\n\n===The Horse Museum===\n[[Image:Skeleton of Arkle the horse at the Irish National Stud.jpg|thumb|250px|Skeleton of [[Arkle]] the horse]]\nThe horse museum at the Irish National Stud has on display the skeleton of [[Arkle]] the horse.\n\n==Governance==\nAll shares in the stud's holding company are vested in the Minister for Finance of Ireland, aside from nominal shareholdings provided to directors.

Descending the pilgrim finds an easy bridge across the roaring falls and treads the stepping stones through the level garden of lease and contentment to the hill of mourning where his soul goes forth though the gate of eternity.\n\n===St. Fiachra's Garden===\nTo celebrate the Millennium, this garden was opened in 1999 and commemorates the Patron Saint of Gardeners [[Saint Fiacre|St. Fiachra or Fiacre]].\n\n===The Horse Museum===\n[[Image:Skeleton of Arkle the horse at the Irish National Stud.jpg|thumb|250px|Skeleton of [[Arkle]] the horse]]\nThe horse museum at the Irish National Stud has on display the skeleton of [[Arkle]] the horse.\n\n==Governance==\nAll shares in the stud's holding company are vested in the Minister for Finance of Ireland, aside from nominal shareholdings provided to directors.

Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of [[Brahmin]]. The second one is Kapila. He is a a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar ([[Blacksmith|Black Smith]]). Both Dev Datt and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of  their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to to get rid from this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave. \n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapil that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his head to Goddess Kali and his arms to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice-versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three e leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies. \n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the dual between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice-versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All all the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150030/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Act - II ===\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ''\u2032[[Vikramaditya]] and [[Vetala|Betaal]]\u2032'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198806-vikram-and-betaal |title=Vikram And Betaal |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.  \n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a dual. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.  \n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing national Anthem as he believes that people who sing national anthem, lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs.

Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of [[Brahmin]]. The second one is Kapila. He is a a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar ([[Blacksmith|Black Smith]]). Both Dev Datt and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of  their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to to get rid from this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave. \n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapil that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his head to Goddess Kali and his arms to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice-versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three e leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies. \n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the dual between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice-versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All all the characters become statue for a moment and the narrator addresses the the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. The Act 1 ends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150030/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-1|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Act - II ===\nThe act begins  as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ''\u2032[[Vikramaditya]] and [[Vetala|Betaal]]\u2032'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198806-vikram-and-betaal |title=Vikram And Betaal |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devduta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.  \n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself the similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a dual. Both gets killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all starts laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.  \n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing national Anthem as he believes that people who sing national anthem, lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs. The boy starts sings a tragic song which was chanted by his mother, Padmini. Hayavadana tries to laugh and his voice completely changes into a horse'. Now Hayavadana is a complete horse. \n\nBhagwata asks the Actor to go Brahmin Vidyasagar and informs him that his grandson is coming to him riding on a great horse. Bhagwata  thanks Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-2|title=LitCharts|website=LitCharts|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113150018/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/hayavadana/act-2|archive-date=2020-01-13|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Indian plays]]\n[[Category:1971 plays]]\n[[Category:Kannada literature]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed +", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayavadana"}
