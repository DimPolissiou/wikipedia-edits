In 23 matches, Filipovi\u0107 recorded eight victories, eight draws and seven defeats. He left in January 2010 when his contract expired. During his tenure, Montenegro rose to 73rd position in the FIFA rankings.<br>\nMontenegro played at the 2007 [[Kirin Cup]], but finished in last place behind [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]].<br>\nOn 26 March 2008, Montenegro recorded one of its best results with a 3\u20131 win over [[Norway national football team|Norway]].\n\n===First competitive matches===\nOn 6 September 2008, Montenegro played their first World Cup qualifier against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] at the Podgorica City Stadium. Bulgaria took the lead in the 11th minute with a goal from [[Stiliyan Petrov]]. [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored in the 61st minute to tie the game, before [[Igor Burzanovi\u0107]] put Montenegro ahead 82nd minute from a penalty. However, a last-minute equalizer from [[Blagoy Georgiev]] denied Montenegro their first competitive win. In their next match on 10 September, they achieved another notable result when they held the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] to a 0\u20130 draw.<br>\nAnother near-upset came in a narrow 2\u20131 loss against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. After [[Alberto Aquilani]]'s early strike, Vu\u010dini\u0107 quickly equalized, but Aquilani scored the winning goal ten minutes later. Their second match against Italy ended 2\u20130 in favour of the world champions. Another disappointment came when the team could only draw 0\u20130 against [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]], followed by a 2\u20132 draw against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] after being two goals down. On 5 September 2009, Montenegro took an early lead against Bulgaria in [[Sofia]] with [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] putting them 1\u20130 up, only for Bulgaria to recover and win 4\u20131. After drawing 1\u20131 with Cyprus, Montenegro finally registered their first competitive win, beating Georgia 2\u20131. They then drew 0\u20130 with the Republic of Ireland at [[Croke Park]]. They finished fifth in the group with nine points, below Cyprus on goal difference.\n\n===Golden era===\n[[File:Stevan Jovetic 2012 MNE.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stevan Joveti\u0107]]\nDuring the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification campaign]], the team recorded further success. They opened their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]; [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored the only goal. A few days later, the team defeated Bulgaria 1\u20130 in Sofia. The next month, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 and then recorded a 0\u20130 draw in [[London]] against [[England national football team|England]]. On 4 June 2011, Montenegro drew 1\u20131 against Bulgaria, with [[Radomir \u0110alovi\u0107]] scoring for Montenegro early in the second half, but [[Ivelin Popov]] scoring minutes later, to keep Montenegro second in the group, behind England on goal difference.<br>\nMontenegro were beaten 2\u20131 by Wales in [[Cardiff]]. They were still second in Group G, but Switzerland closed the gap between them to only three points.<br>\nIn the June 2011 FIFA rankings, Montenegro recorded their highest ranking of 16th.<br>\nOn 7 October, Montenegro came back from 2\u20130 down to draw 2\u20132 against England in Podgorica, after [[Wayne Rooney]] was sent off. Wales beat Switzerland 2\u20130 to ensure Montenegro won a play-off place, putting the team two matches away from qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. In their last match in the qualifiers, Montenegro lost 2\u20130 to Switzerland in [[Basel]]. On 13 October, the draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs]] was held in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]]. Montenegro were paired with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], but they lost 3\u20130 on aggregate and failed to qualify.<br>\nMontenegro were drawn in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group H|Group H]] in the qualifiers, along with England, [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]].<br>\nIn their first match, Montenegro tied against Poland in a 2\u20132 draw.

In their last match in 2012, Montenegro faced San Marino in Podgorica on 14 November, and won 3\u20130.\n<br>\nMontenegro played their fifth qualifier match against Moldova in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] on 22 March 2013, winning 1\u20130 through Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107's goal. Montenegro then returned to Podgorica to play the second-placed England. The outcome was a 1\u20131 draw.\n<br>\nLeading their World Cup qualifying group, Montenegro hosted Ukraine on 7 June 2013. They suffered their first defeat in the group, losing 4\u20130. The match also saw Montenegro finish the match with nine men after [[Vladimir Volkov]] and [[Savo Pavi\u0107evi\u0107]] were sent off. Their last four matches yielded just a single point; a 1\u20131 draw in Poland. Their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign finished with a 5\u20132 home defeat to Moldova, and they finished third behind England and Ukraine.\n\n===Ups and downs===\nOn 23 February 2014 in [[Nice]], Montenegro were drawn for qualification in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group G|Group G]] alongside [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], Moldova and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]. Though they opened their campaign with a 2\u20130 win over Moldova, they failed to qualify with a 0\u20130 tie against Liechtenstein, a 1\u20130 loss to Austria and a 1\u20131 tie at home to Sweden.<br>\nOn 27 March 2015, Montenegro's home match against Russia was abandoned after 67 minutes due to crowd violence, after the Russian [[left-back]] [[Dmitri Kombarov]] was hit by a projectile. The score was 0\u20130 and Russia had missed a penalty moments before the match was abandoned. The Russian goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] was hit by a flare, causing a second 33-minute delay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-arrests-fans-for-football-match-bowl|title=Montenegro Arrests Fans for Football Violence|website=balkaninsight.com|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> The abandoned match was ruled a 3\u20130 win in Russia's favour.<br>\nMontenegro finished fourth at the end of the campaign and placed 95th on the FIFA ranking list.<br>\nMontenegro participated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group E|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] and were placed with Poland, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Poland and Romania had been participants in the [[UEFA Euro 2016]], but Montenegro began by drawing 1\u20131 away to Romania, beating Kazakhstan 5\u20130 at home and defeating Denmark 1\u20130. However, they then lost 3\u20132 away to Armenia despite leading 2\u20130, and were defeated 2\u20131 at home by Poland. Montenegro then rebounded, beating Armenia 4\u20131 and Kazakhstan 3\u20130. They later eliminated Romania with a 1\u20130 victory, but losses to the Danes and Poles ended Montenegro's chance of qualifying.<br>\nHaving failed to reach the World Cup, Montenegro had a dismal performance in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C]]. The team was grouped with [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]. Montenegro only managed two victories, all against Lithuania, and suffered two losses to Serbia, one defeat to Romania at home and an away draw to the Romanian side as well. This effectively denied Montenegro a chance to qualify to the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] playoff.\n\n===Worst campaign===\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group A|EURO 2020 qualifiers]] for Montenegro have been the worst in the team's short history. After unsuccessful [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C|Nations League]] campaign, the team started off with a 1\u20131 away draw to Bulgaria, following a controversial penalty for the hosts. It was followed with a 1\u20135 loss at home to England despite having taken an early lead. <br>\nOn the day of the match with [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], Serbian coach [[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107]] and two players originated from Serbia, due to political reasons, abandoned the national team, betraying the squad in unprecedented condition before the two crucial matches for qualifiers. Montenegro managed to avoid defeat against Kosovo (1-1), however they lost to Czech Republic 0\u20133. The same result occurred in the rematch, one month later. With no chances to qualify directly, Montenegro failed to win the match against last placed Bulgaria (0-0), and lost to Kosovo (0-2).<br>\nAt the end of their worst campaign, Montenegro suffered the biggest defeat in history. On 14 November 2019, they were defeated against England in [[London]] 7-0.<br>\nExcept the fact that they finished qualifiers without single victory, Montenegro scored only three goals on eight matches, and conceded 22. Also, throughout the entire qualifying campaign the team had troubles with injuries of the key players, especially [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] and [[Stefan Savi\u0107]].\n\n==FIFA rankings==\n{{Main|Montenegro national football team records and statistics}}\nMontenegro national football team is present on [[FIFA rankings]] since June 2007.

The team's nickname is \"The Brave Falcons\" ({{lang-cnr|Hrabri Sokoli|italics=yes}}).\n\n===Stadium===\n{{Main|Podgorica City Stadium}}\nMontenegro play home matches at the [[Podgorica City Stadium]] ({{lang-cnr|Stadion pod Goricom|italics=yes}}). The stadium's capacity is 15,230, but international matches reduce this to between 10,700 and 13,000.\n\n===Camp FSCG===\n{{main|Camp FSCG}}\nThe Football Association of Montenegro owns Camp FSCG, a Montenegrin training ground. Built in 2007, the centre has a total area of 54,000 square metres.<ref>http://www.podgorica.me/sport</ref> It is located on ''\u0106emovsko polje'', a plain located in the outskirts of Podgorica outskirts between the settlements of [[Stari Aerodrom]] and [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]]. It consists of six pitches with stands and floodlights,<ref>http://fscg.me/istorija-savez/investicije</ref> and ''House of Football'' \u2013 the seat of the Football Association of Montenegro.<ref>http://cdm.me/sport/fudbal/video-zavirite-u-novu-kucu-fudbala/</ref>\n\nThe camp currently represents an important asset for the whole Montenegrin football system. The grounds are home to all Montenegrin national teams (men and women) and numerous local teams from Podgorica. CAMP FSCG meets the criteria for [[Montenegrin First League]] games and [[UEFA]] competitions for young players.\n\n===Kit===\nThe team kit is produced by the Italian company [[Legea]]. It is all-red with gold details to reflect the colours of the [[Flag of Montenegro|Montenegrin national flag]]. Before that, the kit providers were ''daCapo''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Manufacturer</span>\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Period</span>\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|SRB}} ''daCapo'' ||2007\u20132008\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Legea]] ||2008\u2013present\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF0000\" colspan=2|\n|}\n\n===Supporters===\nAt competitive matches, the Montenegrin home ground [[Podgorica City Stadium]] is often filled to capacity. The stadium is regarded as too small to meet the needs of the national team. Demand for the World Cup qualifier against Italy in 2009 was 30,000 tickets; 40,000 for the Euro 2012 qualifying match against England in 2011.\n\nMontenegro's loudest and most loyal supporters are named ''Ultra Crna Gora'' (\u0423\u043b\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430; ''Ultra Montenegro''). As an [[ultras]] group, their support consists of standing up and singing for 90 minutes both home and away. They occupy the north and south stands of [[Podgorica City Stadium]]. Choreography is usually performed at the beginning of games. ''Ultra Crna Gora'' consists of many subgroups, mostly named after Podgorica's neighborhoods and [[List of cities in Montenegro|Montenegrin towns]] in other parts of the country.\n\n==Players==\nIn [[FIFA|international football]], players can normally only play for one national team once they play in all or part of any match recognised as a full international by [[FIFA]]. However, an exception is made in cases where one or more newly independent states are created out of a former state. Based on current FIFA rules, a player will be eligible to play for Montenegro, even if he had previously represented Serbia and Montenegro or any other country, if at least one of the following statements applies:<ref>https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status%5ftransfer%5fen%5f25.pdf</ref>\n\n*The player was born in Montenegro;\n*At least one of their parents and/or at least one of their grandparents was born in Montenegro;\n*The player has lived in Montenegro continuously for any five-year period.\n\nDue to mixed ancestries, it is likely that a high percentage of the players eligible to play for Montenegro will also remain eligible to play for Serbia, and vice versa. However, once they have played for either Serbia or Montenegro in any competitive fixture, they are no longer eligible to play for any other nation.\n\n===Current squad===\nThe following players were

Bulgaria took the lead in the 11th minute with a goal from [[Stiliyan Petrov]]. [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored in the 61st minute to tie the game, before [[Igor Burzanovi\u0107]] put Montenegro ahead 82nd minute from a penalty. However, a last-minute equalizer from [[Blagoy Georgiev]] denied Montenegro their first competitive win. In their next match on 10 September, they achieved another notable result when they held the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] to a 0\u20130 draw.<br>\nAnother near-upset came in a narrow 2\u20131 loss against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. After [[Alberto Aquilani]]'s early strike, Vu\u010dini\u0107 quickly equalized, but Aquilani scored the winning goal ten minutes later. Their second match against Italy ended 2\u20130 in favour of the world champions. Another disappointment came when the team could only draw 0\u20130 against [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]], followed by a 2\u20132 draw against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] after being two goals down. On 5 September 2009, Montenegro took an early lead against Bulgaria in [[Sofia]] with [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] putting them 1\u20130 up, only for Bulgaria to recover and win 4\u20131. After drawing 1\u20131 with Cyprus, Montenegro finally registered their first competitive win, beating Georgia 2\u20131. They then drew 0\u20130 with the Republic of Ireland at [[Croke Park]]. They finished fifth in the group with nine points, below Cyprus on goal difference.\n\n===Golden era===\n[[File:Stevan Jovetic 2012 MNE.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Stevan Joveti\u0107]]\nDuring the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification campaign]], the team recorded further success. They opened their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over [[Wales national football team|Wales]]; [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] scored the only goal. A few days later, the team defeated Bulgaria 1\u20130 in Sofia. The next month, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 and then recorded a 0\u20130 draw in [[London]] against [[England national football team|England]]. On 4 June 2011, Montenegro drew 1\u20131 against Bulgaria, with [[Radomir \u0110alovi\u0107]] scoring for Montenegro early in the second half, but [[Ivelin Popov]] scoring minutes later, to keep Montenegro second in the group, behind England on goal difference.<br>\nMontenegro were beaten 2\u20131 by Wales in [[Cardiff]]. They were still second in Group G, but Switzerland closed the gap between them to only three points.<br>\nIn the June 2011 FIFA rankings, Montenegro recorded their highest ranking of 16th.<br>\nOn 7 October, Montenegro came back from 2\u20130 down to draw 2\u20132 against England in Podgorica, after [[Wayne Rooney]] was sent off. Wales beat Switzerland 2\u20130 to ensure Montenegro won a play-off place, putting the team two matches away from qualifying for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. In their last match in the qualifiers, Montenegro lost 2\u20130 to Switzerland in [[Basel]]. On 13 October, the draw for the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying play-offs]] was held in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]]. Montenegro were paired with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], but they lost 3\u20130 on aggregate and failed to qualify.<br>\nMontenegro were drawn in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group H|Group H]] in the qualifiers, along with England, [[Poland national football team|Poland]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] and [[San Marino national football team|San Marino]].<br>\nIn their first match, Montenegro tied against Poland in a 2\u20132 draw.

In their last match in 2012, Montenegro faced San Marino in Podgorica on 14 November, and won 3\u20130.\n<br>\nMontenegro played their fifth qualifier match against Moldova in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]] on 22 March 2013, winning 1\u20130 through Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107's goal. Montenegro then returned to Podgorica to play the second-placed England. The outcome was a 1\u20131 draw.\n<br>\nLeading their World Cup qualifying group, Montenegro hosted Ukraine on 7 June 2013. They suffered their first defeat in the group, losing 4\u20130. The match also saw Montenegro finish the match with nine men after [[Vladimir Volkov]] and [[Savo Pavi\u0107evi\u0107]] were sent off. Their last four matches yielded just a single point; a 1\u20131 draw in Poland. Their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign finished with a 5\u20132 home defeat to Moldova, and they finished third behind England and Ukraine.\n\n===Ups and downs===\nOn 23 February 2014 in [[Nice]], Montenegro were drawn for qualification in [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying Group G|Group G]] alongside [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Austria national football team|Austria]], Moldova and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]. Though they opened their campaign with a 2\u20130 win over Moldova, they failed to qualify with a 0\u20130 tie against Liechtenstein, a 1\u20130 loss to Austria and a 1\u20131 tie at home to Sweden.<br>\nOn 27 March 2015, Montenegro's home match against Russia was abandoned after 67 minutes due to crowd violence, after the Russian [[left-back]] [[Dmitri Kombarov]] was hit by a projectile. The score was 0\u20130 and Russia had missed a penalty moments before the match was abandoned. The Russian goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] was hit by a flare, causing a second 33-minute delay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-arrests-fans-for-football-match-bowl|title=Montenegro Arrests Fans for Football Violence|website=balkaninsight.com|publisher=Balkan Insight|date=31 March 2015|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> The abandoned match was ruled a 3\u20130 win in Russia's favour.<br>\nMontenegro finished fourth at the end of the campaign and placed 95th on the FIFA ranking list.<br>\nMontenegro participated in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group E|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] and were placed with Poland, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Poland and Romania had been participants in the [[UEFA Euro 2016]], but Montenegro began by drawing 1\u20131 away to Romania, beating Kazakhstan 5\u20130 at home and defeating Denmark 1\u20130. However, they then lost 3\u20132 away to Armenia despite leading 2\u20130, and were defeated 2\u20131 at home by Poland. Montenegro then rebounded, beating Armenia 4\u20131 and Kazakhstan 3\u20130. They later eliminated Romania with a 1\u20130 victory, but losses to the Danes and Poles ended Montenegro's chance of qualifying.<br>\nHaving failed to reach the World Cup, Montenegro had a dismal performance in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C]]. The team was grouped with [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]]. Montenegro only managed two victories, all against Lithuania, and suffered two losses to Serbia, one defeat to Romania at home and an away draw to the Romanian side as well. This effectively denied Montenegro a chance to qualify to the [[UEFA Euro 2020]] playoff.\n\n===Worst campaign===\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group A|EURO 2020 qualifiers]] for Montenegro have been the worst in the team's short history. After unsuccessful [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League C|Nations League]] campaign, the team started off with a 1\u20131 away draw to Bulgaria, following a controversial penalty for the hosts. It was followed with a 1\u20135 loss at home to England despite having taken an early lead. <br>\nOn the day of the match with [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], Serbian coach [[Ljubi\u0161a Tumbakovi\u0107]] and two players originated from Serbia, due to political reasons, abandoned the national team, betraying the squad in unprecedented condition before the two crucial matches for qualifiers. Montenegro managed to avoid defeat against Kosovo (1-1), however they lost to Czech Republic 0\u20133. The same result occurred in the rematch, one month later. With no chances to qualify directly, Montenegro failed to win the match against last placed Bulgaria (0-0), and lost to Kosovo (0-2).<br>\nAt the end of their worst campaign, Montenegro suffered the biggest defeat in history. On 14th November 2019, they were defeated against England in [[London]] 7-0.<br>\nExcept the fact that they finished qualifiers without single victory, Montenegro scored only three goals on eight matches, and conceded 22. Also, throughout the entire qualifying campaign the team had troubles with injuries of the key players, especially [[Stevan Joveti\u0107]] and [[Stefan Savi\u0107]].\n\n==FIFA rankings==\n{{Main|Montenegro national football team records and statistics}}\nMontenegro national football team is present on [[FIFA rankings]] since June 2007.

The team's nickname is \"The Brave Falcons\" ({{lang-cnr|Hrabri Sokoli|italics=yes}}).\n\n===Stadium===\n{{Main|Podgorica City Stadium}}\nMontenegro play home matches at the [[Podgorica City Stadium]] ({{lang-cnr|Stadion pod Goricom|italics=yes}}). The stadium's capacity is 15,230, but international matches reduce this to between 10,700 and 13,000.\n\n===Camp FSCG===\n{{main|Camp FSCG}}\nThe Football Association of Montenegro owns Camp FSCG, a Montenegrin training ground. Built in 2007, the centre has a total area of 54,000 square metres.<ref>http://www.podgorica.me/sport</ref> It is located on ''\u0106emovsko polje'', a plain located in the outskirts of Podgorica outskirts between the settlements of [[Stari Aerodrom]] and [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]]. It consists of six pitches with stands and floodlights,<ref>http://fscg.me/istorija-savez/investicije</ref> and ''House of Football'' \u2013 the seat of the Football Association of Montenegro.<ref>http://cdm.me/sport/fudbal/video-zavirite-u-novu-kucu-fudbala/</ref>\n\nThe camp currently represents an important asset for the whole Montenegrin football system. The grounds are home to all Montenegrin national teams (men and women) and numerous local teams from Podgorica. CAMP FSCG meets the criteria for [[Montenegrin First League]] games and [[UEFA]] competitions for young players.\n\n===Kit===\nThe team kit is produced by the Italian company [[Legea]]. It is all-red with gold details to reflect the colours of the [[Flag of Montenegro|Montenegrin national flag]]. Before that, the kit providers were ''daCapo''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Manufacturer</span>\n!style=\"background:#FF0000\"| <span style=\"color:white\">Period</span>\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|SRB}} ''daCapo'' ||2007\u20132008\n|-\n|align=\"Left\"| {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Legea]] ||2008\u2013present\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF0000\" colspan=2|\n|}\n\n===Supporters===\nAt competitive matches, the Montenegrin home ground [[Podgorica City Stadium]] is often filled to capacity. The stadium is regarded as too small to meet the needs of the national team. Demand for the World Cup qualifier against Italy in 2009 was 30,000 tickets; 40,000 for the Euro 2012 qualifying match against England in 2011.\n\nMontenegro's loudest and most loyal supporters are named ''Ultra Crna Gora'' (\u0423\u043b\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430; ''Ultra Montenegro''). As an [[ultras]] group, their support consists of standing up and singing for 90 minutes both home and away. They occupy the north and south stands of [[Podgorica City Stadium]]. Choreography is usually performed at the beginning of games. ''Ultra Crna Gora'' consists of many subgroups, mostly named after Podgorica's neighborhoods and [[List of cities in Montenegro|Montenegrin towns]] in other parts of the country.\n\n==Players==\nIn [[FIFA|international football]], players can normally only play for one national team once they play in all or part of any match recognised as a full international by [[FIFA]]. However, an exception is made in cases where one or more newly independent states are created out of a former state. Based on current FIFA rules, a player will be eligible to play for Montenegro, even if he had previously represented Serbia and Montenegro or any other country, if at least one of the following statements applies:<ref>https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/status%5ftransfer%5fen%5f25.pdf</ref>\n\n*The player was born in Montenegro;\n*At least one of their parents and/or at least one of their grandparents was born in Montenegro;\n*The player has lived in Montenegro continuously for any five-year period.\n\nDue to mixed ancestries, it is likely that a high percentage of the players eligible to play for Montenegro will also remain eligible to play for Serbia, and vice versa. However, once they have played for either Serbia or Montenegro in any competitive fixture, they are no longer eligible to play for any other nation.\n\n===Current squad===\nThe following players were called up for [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying|Euro 2020 qualifying]] game against [[England national football team|England]] on 14 November and friendly match against [[Belarus national football

Manning was the first elected sheriff of [[Lawrence_County,_South_Dakota|Lawrence County]], Dakota Territory which included [[Deadwood,_South_Dakota|Deadwood]]. He served several terms as sheriff, as well as operated saloons, several livery stables, and a cattle & horse ranch in nearby [[Belle_Fourche,_South_Dakota|Belle Fourche]] in South Dakota. \u00a0\n\n==Early life==\n\nJohn J. Manning was born in [[County_Kilkenny|County Kilkenny]], Ireland on Feb. 2, 1842 to parents James & Julia Manning. In 1847, the Manning family immigrated to the United States, and quickly settled in [[Highland,_Wisconsin|Highland, Iowa County, Wisconsin]]. John spent his adolescence years in Highland with his parents and older brother Thomas and a younger sister Mary. During that time, John's father was engaged in farming. John remained in Highland until 1860, and shortly thereafter headed West, initially to Colorado, and then Idaho, Montana, Dakota and Alaska.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deadwood Daily Pioneer Times |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2293024/the-daily-deadwood-pioneer-times/ |issue=pg.1, col.3 &4 |date=September 13, 1911}}</ref>\n\n==Montana Territory==\n\nJohn Manning remained in Highland, Wisconsin until 1860, and then headed West to Colorado at the time of the gold rush around Pikes Peak.
