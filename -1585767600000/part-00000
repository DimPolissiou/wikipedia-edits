The enfilade is at the centre on the first floor.]]\n\nThe '''Neva Enfilade''' of the [[Winter Palace]], St Petersburg, is a series of three large halls arranged in an [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] along the palace's massive facade facing the [[River Neva]].\n\nOriginally designed as a series of five state rooms by the architect [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Francesco Rastrelli]] in 1753, they were transformed into an enfilade of three vast halls in 1790 by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. Following a fire in 1837 they were rebuilt under the direction of [[Vasily Stasov]]. Frequently used as the palace ballrooms, they formed a processional route, and were the focus of the imperial court. In 1915, the last Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], had the enfilade transformed into a [[military hospital]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the enfilade, along with the remainder of the building, has been used as a series of exhibition halls of the [[State Hermitage Museum]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:NevaEnfilade.png|thumb|right|300px|The Winter Palace's Neva enfilade is shaded red.

The Tsaritsa found the small Winter palace of [[Peter the Great]] insufficiently grand, and had taken over the neighbouring, and grander, palace of Admiral General [[Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin]], this she had rebuilt to form her own Winter Palace.\n\nDuring the reign of Anna's successor, [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]], Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale&mdash;the present [[Baroque]] Winter Palace (externally the palace seen today); the Tsaritsa wanted the palace to exceed in beauty and size all other European royal palaces.{{r|Hermitage}} The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of national honour to the Empress, and to pay for it taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for Russia's wars. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles.{{sfnp|Orloff|Shvidkovsky|1996}} By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, an imperial Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion; at that time, the Neva enfilade contained five principal state rooms. Work continued during the short reign of Elizabeth's nephew Peter III and on into the reign of Peter's widow [[Catherine the Great]].\n\nDuring Catherine the Great's reign, Neoclassicism came into vogue, and the new Tsaritsa was a great admirer. Rastrelli was dismissed and new architects working in the new fashions were employed. During this period, the original ornate rococo decoration of the palace was replaced with the more simple and stark neoclassicism which is a hallmark of the Palace today. The Neva enfilade was completely redesigned between 1790\u201393 by the architect [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. Taking in the floor above, he transformed the original five rooms into three vast halls: the Concert Hall, the Great Hall and the Great Ante-Room. They were decorated in classical style with faux marbre and columns supporting life size statues.{{r|Hermitage}}\n\nFollowing a disastrous fire which destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interiors in 1837, the halls were recreated in similar style by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]].{{r|Hermitage}}\n\n==Court use of the enfilade==\n[[File:Winter Palacebanquet1874..jpg|thumb|left|A banquet in the Nicholas Hall in 1874]]\n\nUntil 1905, during the winter months, the Tsar and Tsaritsa were traditionally resident in the palace; this was the period of the Saint Petersburg [[social season]] and the first floor  [[piano nobile]] would be in near constant use. The remainder of the year the imperial couple resided elsewhere, and the palace housed the staff and the officials of the monarchy, who occupied the ground and second floors. The halls of the enfilade were designed to form an important part in the ceremonial life of the court, not just as ballrooms for festivities but for processional use. From the entrance to the private apartments at the western end of the Concert Hall, Imperial processions would proceed in state through the enfilade to the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan Staircase]] or turn and continue through the eastern state rooms.\n\nBefore 1917, during ceremonies and functions, access to the various hall of the enfilade was dictated by rank. Those who were most important were positioned closest to the beginning of an imperial procession in the Concert Hall, the lesser exalted in the Nicholas Hall and the least important in the Great Ante-Room.{{r|Sitwell}} The imperial court was very conscious of rank. This was particularly obvious amongst the ladies attached to the court. Etiquette dictated that all these ladies, regardless of age, wore white silk dresses with a low [[decolletage]] and a red or olive green velvet train with gold embroidery. On their heads they wore red or green [[kokoshnik]]s studded with jewels.{{r|Sitwell}} While other women present were allowed coloured dresses, the train and kokoshnik was mandatory court dress.\n\nFurther classification was given to the women's ranks by indication of whether they were \"Dames a Portrait\" or \"Demoiselles d'Honneur.\" The former, higher ranking class wore the Tsaritsa's portrait mounted in diamonds on their left breast, while the latter wore the Tsaritsa's monogram surrounded by diamonds. In between these two ranks were the \"Dames du Palais\" who like the \"Dames a portrait\" wore olive green, the lower ranking \"Demoiselles d'Honneur\" wore red.{{r|Sitwell}}\n\n[[File:Nicholas II of Russia painted by Earnest Lipgart.jpg|thumb|upright|Nicholas II, last Tsar of all the Russias, in the \n[[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|Nicholas Hall]].

Each Grand Duchess had her own colour, and all the ladies attached to the suite would wear it. Queen Victoria's foreign secretary, writing to her in 1894 of a state procession through the enfilade, recorded of the Grand Duchesses' colours that one \"is a particularly hideous shade of orange.\" The Foreign Secretary then went on to describe the \"8,000 to 10,000\" people present in the Winter palace's \"interminable halls\", and a particular \"Demoiselle d'Honneur\" who was \"so old that she was propped up against a wall.\" Overall, the splendour and size of the Winter Palace and its colourful and bejewelled ladies failed to impress the Foreign Secretary for he reported to the Queen that the Grand Church \"was not very large\" and that the assembled imperial court had \"an absence of beauty as compared with that seen at one of Your Majesty's drawing rooms.\" He did, however, concede that the Queen's granddaughter looked \"simply magnificent...the perfection of what one would imagine an Empress of Russia on her way to the altar would be.\"{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=110|ps=}}{{efn|Quoting [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]] to Queen Victoria; 14 November 1894.}} That wedding of Queen Victoria's granddaughter to the Tsar was to be one of the final huge gatherings at the Palace, however. The palace's state rooms had had their [[swan song]] during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] between 1855 and 1881.\n\nAlexander II was the last Tsar to use the Winter Palace extensively not only for governing the empire but also entertaining. Of special note were the Bals des Palmiers given at the palace. On these occasions, 100 palm trees were brought from the hot houses at Tsarskoe Selo; these would be scattered throughout the enfilade, and around them supper tables seating 15 people would be constructed. During the course of the evening the Tsar would make the rounds of the tables, eating a piece of bread or fruit at each, in order that the guests may say that they had dined with the Tsar.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|pp=190\u2013192|ps=}}\n\nFollowing the assassination of Alexander II, the Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=216|ps=}} The Imperial family then moved to the seclusion of the [[Palace of Gatchina]], some 40 miles from St. Petersburg.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=216|ps=}} When in St. Petersburg, the Imperial family resided at the [[Anichkov Palace]], but the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Alexander III, however, was not a lover of society and, when using the Winter Palace, preferred playing bridge in an anteroom to dancing. While most St Petersburg balls did not conclude until 6am, at the Winter Palace, from 2am the Tsar would dismiss the musicians from the orchestra one by one, until only the pianist and a fiddler remained, by which time his guests had taken the hint and gone.{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=221|ps=}}\n\nThe final imperial reception at the Winter Palace was a themed, fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of [[Alexis I of Russia|Alexei I]], which took place on 22 January 1903. The Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovitch]] recalled the occasion as \"the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low.\"{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=226|ps=}} The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei I]] and the Tsaritsa as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], all dressed in rich 17th century attire posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=227|ps=}} for what was to be their final photograph together.{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=64}} The following year Russia was at war, and the Tsar and Tsaritsa abandoned St Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Tsaritsa to be decadent and immoral{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=246|ps=}}) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo.\n\n==The Concert Hall==\n[[File:ConcerthallWinter Palace.jpg|thumb|right|The Concert Hall, the Winter Palace, St Petersburg. Looking towards the doors of [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|The Nicholas Hall]]. This room, closest to the private apartments was reserved for the court's elite. Watercolor by [[Alexander Kolb (artist)|Alexander Kolb]] (1860s).]]\n\n'''The Concert Hall''' has an [[architrave]] seemingly supported by paired Corinthian columns, the capitals of which serve as plinthes for life-size statues of the various [[muse]]s. It is decorated in a similar loose Baroque influenced neoclassical style as the Great Anteroom at the western end of the Enfilade. It is indicative of the size of the Winter Palace, that whereas most other royal palaces  such as [[Buckingham Palace]], [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz]] and [[Sanssouci]] all have [[music room]]s, the Winter Palace has a concert hall. This is because it was the intention of the builders of the Winter Palace that their palace should outshine all other royal palaces. In fact Catherine the Great, for whom the enfilade was designed, was delighted when she bought an art collection for the Winter palace that Frederick the Great, the creator of Sanssouci could not afford.\n\nSo it was, that from this vast double height hall that solemn Imperial processions began. On such occasions the Concert Hall would be reserved for  the highest ranking guest and members of the court.{{r|Sitwell}} At a given moment, four \"massive Ethiopians\", the Tsar's official bodyguards, fantastically dressed in scarlet trousers, gold jackets, white turbans and curved shoes, would ceremonially open the doors from the private [[Arabian Hall of the Winter Palace|Arabian Hall]] (''2 on plan above'') and the imperial procession would pass through the enfilade.{{sfnp|Massie|1967|p=129|ps=}}{{efn|Sitwell writes: \"These are no mere Negroes: they are Christian Abyssinians.\"}} The procession through would be preceded by the Marshal of the Court carrying a gold staff seven [[foot (length)|feet]] high topped with a diamond crown.{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=110|ps=}} On less formal occasions, as the hall's name suggests, it was used for concerts, balls and grand receptions.\n\nToday, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], the room houses the silver reliquary of [[St Alexander Nevsky]], formerly at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]]. The reliquary was brought to the Palace in 1922, where it was set up to obscure the now blocked, grand doors from which the Imperial family used to enter from the private apartments.\n\n==The Nicholas Hall==\n[[File:Grand NicholasHall.jpg|thumb|The Nicholas Hall, by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]] (1879)]]\nThe '''Nicholas Hall''' is located in the centre of the enfilade. The largest room in the palace at {{convert|1103|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, it was originally simply known as the Great Hall, and was the setting for many imperial balls and receptions.  Following the death of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in 1855, a large equestrian portrait of the late tsar was hung from the wall, and the hall was renamed the Nicholas Hall.\n\nWhile in the same architectural rhythm as the preceding Concert Hall, the architecture is more severe. Here, the architrave is immediately below the ceiling. The only ornamentation is the carving of the corinthian capitals and the [[entablature]].\n\nWriting in 1902, the [[Millicent Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Duchess of Sutherland]] and the American-born [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], herself the chatelaine of one of [[Blenheim Palace|Britain's great palaces]], described their impressions of a court ball held in the Nicholas Hall.\n\n::The Duchess of Sutherland wrote: \"The stairs of the palace were guarded by [[cossack]]s, with hundreds of [[footman|footmen]] in scarlet [[livery|liveries]], I have never in my life seen so brilliant a sight - the light, the uniforms, the enormous rooms, the crowd, the music, making a spectacle that was almost Barbaric in splendour...They seat at supper nearly four thousand people\"\n\n::While the Duchess of Marlborough recorded that dinner (she sat beside the Tsar) was protracted and comprised \"soups, caviar and monster sturgeons, meat and game, pates and primeurs, ices and fruits, all mounted on gold and silver plate fashioned by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain|Germain]]\"\n\nIronically, the Duchess of Sutherland then went on to describe the hungry peasants outside the gates - \"... all the want of penury of the peasants and this strange show to keep up the prestige of the aristocracy and the autocracy of one gentle, quiet little man.\"{{sfnp|Stuart|1982|p=97|ps=}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the hall was used as an infirmary.  It was restored in 1957, when the [[State Hermitage Museum]] was under the direction of [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]].{{sfnp|Norman|1998|p=283|ps=}}\n\n==The Great Antechamber==\n[[File:Avantsalle.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Ante-Chamber, the Winter Palace, St Petersburg, by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]] (1861)]]\n\nThe Great Ante-Chamber of the [[Winter Palace]] is the principal entrance hall to the [[State Apartments|state apartments]] of the palace. The first room of the [[piano nobile]] at the head of the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan staircase]], it formed the processional exit of the Neva enfilade, and presented a procession with a choice, either to descend the staircase and exit the palace, which happened once a year for the ceremony of blessing the waters of the Neva, or to turn right and continue through the next enfilade to the [[Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace|small throne room]] (''5'') or continue on through the [[Armorial Hall of the Winter Palace|Armorial Hall]] (''6'') and [[Military Gallery of the Winter Palace|Military Gallery]] (''7'') to the [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Room of the Winter Palace|Great Throne Room]] (''8'') or [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]] (''9'').\n\n==Exhibition halls==\nToday, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]] the halls of the Neva enfilade are preserved as \"palace interiors\" containing only minimal furniture they are used for exhibitions. Many of the mirrors which lined the interior walls opposite each window have been concealed behind exhibition boards which creates a utilitarian feel to the halls, and one has to look upwards to the carved [[captal]]s, statues, great chandeliers and moulded ceilings to gain an impression of the hall's glacial grandeur and classical architecture.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{notelist}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Hermitage\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=23 September 2008 |publisher=The State Hermitage Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208094716/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1.html |archivedate=8 February 2007|url-status=dead |mode=cs2}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sitwell\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/valse/parttwo.html |title=Valse des fleurs |last=Sitwell |first=Sacheverell |publisher=Alexander Palace |accessdate=12 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YTGxMLwU |archivedate=12 May 2015 |url-status=live |mode=cs2}}\n</ref>\n}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |last=Cowles |first=Virginia |year=1971 |title=The Romanovs |publisher=William Collins, Sons & Company |isbn=978-0-00-211724-1}}\n*{{citation |last=Kurth |first=Peter |year=1995 |title=Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra |publisher=Little, Brown and Company (UK) |isbn=0-316-50787-3}}\n*{{citation |last=Massie |first=Robert K. |title=Nicholas and Alexandra |publisher=Atheneum |year=1967}}\n*{{citation |last1=Maylunas |first1=Andrei |last2=Mironenko |first2=Sergei |year=1996 |title=A Lifelong Passion |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |isbn=0-297-81520-2}}\n*{{citation |last=Norman |first=Geraldine |year=1998 |title=The Hermitage: The Biography of a Great Museum |publisher=Fromm |isbn=0-88064-190-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hermitagebiograp0000norm }}\n*{{citation |last1=Orloff |first1=Alexander |last2=Shvidkovsky |first2=Dmitri |year=1996 |title=Saint Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars |publisher=Abbeville Press}}\n*{{citation |last=Stuart |first=D. |year=1982 |title=Dear Duchess: Millicent, Duchess of Sutherland (1867\u20131955) |publisher=Victor Gollancz}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation |last=Budberg |first=Moura |year=1969 |title=Great Palaces (The Winter Palace.

The Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Alexander Mikhailovitch]] recalled the occasion as \"the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low.\"{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=226|ps=}} The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as [[Alexis of Russia|Alexei I]] and the Tsaritsa as [[Maria Miloslavskaya]], all dressed in rich 17th century attire posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the [[Kremlin]],{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=227|ps=}} for what was to be their final photograph together.{{sfnp|Kurth|1995|p=64}} The following year Russia was at war, and the Tsar and Tsaritsa abandoned St Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Tsaritsa to be decadent and immoral{{sfnp|Cowles|1971|p=246|ps=}}) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo.\n\n==The Concert Hall==\n[[File:ConcerthallWinter Palace.jpg|thumb|right|The Concert Hall, the Winter Palace, St Petersburg. Looking towards the doors of [[Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace|The Nicholas Hall]]. This room, closest to the private apartments was reserved for the court's elite. Watercolor by [[Alexander Kolb (artist)|Alexander Kolb]] (1860s).]]\n\n'''The Concert Hall''' has an [[architrave]] seemingly supported by paired Corinthian columns, the capitals of which serve as plinthes for life-size statues of the various [[muse]]s. It is decorated in a similar loose Baroque influenced neoclassical style as the Great Anteroom at the western end of the Enfilade. It is indicative of the size of the Winter Palace, that whereas most other royal palaces  such as [[Buckingham Palace]], [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz]] and [[Sanssouci]] all have [[music room]]s, the Winter Palace has a concert hall. This is because it was the intention of the builders of the Winter Palace that their palace should outshine all other royal palaces. In fact Catherine the Great, for whom the enfilade was designed, was delighted when she bought an art collection for the Winter palace that Frederick the Great, the creator of Sanssouci could not afford.\n\nSo it was, that from this vast double height hall that solemn Imperial processions began. On such occasions the Concert Hall would be reserved for  the highest ranking guest and members of the court.{{r|Sitwell}} At a given moment, four \"massive Ethiopians\", the Tsar's official bodyguards, fantastically dressed in scarlet trousers, gold jackets, white turbans and curved shoes, would ceremonially open the doors from the private [[Arabian Hall of the Winter Palace|Arabian Hall]] (''2 on plan above'') and the imperial procession would pass through the enfilade.{{sfnp|Massie|1967|p=129|ps=}}{{efn|Sitwell writes: \"These are no mere Negroes: they are Christian Abyssinians.\"}} The procession through would be preceded by the Marshal of the Court carrying a gold staff seven [[foot (length)|feet]] high topped with a diamond crown.{{sfnp|Maylunas|Mironenko|1996|p=110|ps=}} On less formal occasions, as the hall's name suggests, it was used for concerts, balls and grand receptions.\n\nToday, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], the room houses the silver reliquary of [[St Alexander Nevsky]], formerly at the [[Alexander Nevsky Monastery]]. The reliquary was brought to the Palace in 1922, where it was set up to obscure the now blocked, grand doors from which the Imperial family used to enter from the private apartments.\n\n==The Nicholas Hall==\n[[File:Grand NicholasHall.jpg|thumb|The Nicholas Hall, by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]] (1879)]]\nThe '''Nicholas Hall''' is located in the centre of the enfilade. The largest room in the palace at {{convert|1103|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, it was originally simply known as the Great Hall, and was the setting for many imperial balls and receptions.  Following the death of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in 1855, a large equestrian portrait of the late tsar was hung from the wall, and the hall was renamed the Nicholas Hall.\n\nWhile in the same architectural rhythm as the preceding Concert Hall, the architecture is more severe. Here, the architrave is immediately below the ceiling. The only ornamentation is the carving of the corinthian capitals and the [[entablature]].\n\nWriting in 1902, the [[Millicent Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|Duchess of Sutherland]] and the American-born [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|Duchess of Marlborough]], herself the chatelaine of one of [[Blenheim Palace|Britain's great palaces]], described their impressions of a court ball held in the Nicholas Hall.\n\n::The Duchess of Sutherland wrote: \"The stairs of the palace were guarded by [[cossack]]s, with hundreds of [[footman|footmen]] in scarlet [[livery|liveries]], I have never in my life seen so brilliant a sight - the light, the uniforms, the enormous rooms, the crowd, the music, making a spectacle that was almost Barbaric in splendour...They seat at supper nearly four thousand people\"\n\n::While the Duchess of Marlborough recorded that dinner (she sat beside the Tsar) was protracted and comprised \"soups, caviar and monster sturgeons, meat and game, pates and primeurs, ices and fruits, all mounted on gold and silver plate fashioned by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain|Germain]]\"\n\nIronically, the Duchess of Sutherland then went on to describe the hungry peasants outside the gates - \"... all the want of penury of the peasants and this strange show to keep up the prestige of the aristocracy and the autocracy of one gentle, quiet little man.\"{{sfnp|Stuart|1982|p=97|ps=}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the hall was used as an infirmary.  It was restored in 1957, when the [[State Hermitage Museum]] was under the direction of [[Mikhail Illarionovich Artamonov|Mikhail Artamonov]].{{sfnp|Norman|1998|p=283|ps=}}\n\n==The Great Antechamber==\n[[File:Avantsalle.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Ante-Chamber, the Winter Palace, St Petersburg, by [[Konstantin Ukhtomsky]] (1861)]]\n\nThe Great Ante-Chamber of the [[Winter Palace]] is the principal entrance hall to the [[State Apartments|state apartments]] of the palace. The first room of the [[piano nobile]] at the head of the [[Jordan Staircase of the Winter Palace|Jordan staircase]], it formed the processional exit of the Neva enfilade, and presented a procession with a choice, either to descend the staircase and exit the palace, which happened once a year for the ceremony of blessing the waters of the Neva, or to turn right and continue through the next enfilade to the [[Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace|small throne room]] (''5'') or continue on through the [[Armorial Hall of the Winter Palace|Armorial Hall]] (''6'') and [[Military Gallery of the Winter Palace|Military Gallery]] (''7'') to the [[St George's Hall, and Apollo Room of the Winter Palace|Great Throne Room]] (''8'') or [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace|Grand Church]] (''9'').\n\n==Exhibition halls==\nToday, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]] the halls of the Neva enfilade are preserved as \"palace interiors\" containing only minimal furniture they are used for exhibitions. Many of the mirrors which lined the interior walls opposite each window have been concealed behind exhibition boards which creates a utilitarian feel to the halls, and one has to look upwards to the carved [[captal]]s, statues, great chandeliers and moulded ceilings to gain an impression of the hall's glacial grandeur and classical architecture.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{notelist}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Hermitage\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=23 September 2008 |publisher=The State Hermitage Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208094716/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1.html |archivedate=8 February 2007|url-status=dead |mode=cs2}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sitwell\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/valse/parttwo.html |title=Valse des fleurs |last=Sitwell |first=Sacheverell |publisher=Alexander Palace |accessdate=12 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YTGxMLwU |archivedate=12 May 2015 |url-status=live |mode=cs2}}\n</ref>\n}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |last=Cowles |first=Virginia |year=1971 |title=The Romanovs |publisher=William Collins, Sons & Company |isbn=978-0-00-211724-1}}\n*{{citation |last=Kurth |first=Peter |year=1995 |title=Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra |publisher=Little, Brown and Company (UK) |isbn=0-316-50787-3}}\n*{{citation |last=Massie |first=Robert K. |title=Nicholas and Alexandra |publisher=Atheneum |year=1967}}\n*{{citation |last1=Maylunas |first1=Andrei |last2=Mironenko |first2=Sergei |year=1996 |title=A Lifelong Passion |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |isbn=0-297-81520-2}}\n*{{citation |last=Norman |first=Geraldine |year=1998 |title=The Hermitage: The Biography of a Great Museum |publisher=Fromm |isbn=0-88064-190-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hermitagebiograp0000norm }}\n*{{citation |last1=Orloff |first1=Alexander |last2=Shvidkovsky |first2=Dmitri |year=1996 |title=Saint Petersburg: Architecture of the Tsars |publisher=Abbeville Press}}\n*{{citation |last=Stuart |first=D. |year=1982 |title=Dear Duchess: Millicent, Duchess of Sutherland (1867\u20131955) |publisher=Victor Gollancz}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation |last=Budberg |first=Moura |year=1969 |title=Great Palaces (The Winter Palace.

He is the co-founder and public face of [[Cash Money Records]] which he founded with his older brother [[Ronald \"Slim\" Williams]] in 1992. Birdman released his [[Birdman (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 2002, and has gone on to release four solo studio albums in total. Aside from his solo career, he is also a member of the hip-hop duo [[Big Tymers]], along with producer [[Mannie Fresh]].\n\nAlong with his solo work and numerous releases with the Big Tymers, Birdman has released a collaboration album and numerous tracks with fellow rapper and ward [[Lil Wayne]], whom he discovered and took under his wing at age nine. Birdman has also made his name by contributing to the making of YMCMB (Young Money Cash Money Billionaires), a combination of the former's \"Cash Money\" and Lil Wayne's [[Young Money Entertainment]], formerly an imprint under the label. Birdman has also founded the project and hip hop supergroup ''Rich Gang'', bringing attention to artists such as [[Young Thug]] and [[Rich Homie Quan]].\n\n==Early life==\nBirdman was born Bryan Christopher Brooks on February 15, 1969 at [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]] in [[New Orleans]] to Johnnie Williams and Gladys Brooks. For almost a month after his birth, he did not have a given name, which led to people simply calling him \"Baby\", a nickname he retains to this day. Williams did not sign the birth certificate, which led to Bryan taking his mother's surname at birth. As a child, Brooks and his family lived on top of a bar, which was owned by their father. His mother, Gladys, became ill and died in 1975 when Bryan was five years old.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"complex.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/04/birdman-new-video-ms-gladys-featuring-neno-calvin|title=Birdman Honors His Mother in the Video for \"Ms. Gladys\"|website=Complex|accessdate=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"xxlmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/05/birdman-mother-shot/|title=Birdman Reveals His Mother Was Shot When He Was 2 Years Old - XXL|website=XXL Mag|accessdate=27 April 2018}}</ref> After their mother's death, Birdman and his siblings Kim, Ronald and Ray were taken in by their uncle and spent two or three years in [[Prince George, British Columbia]], Canada, followed by two years in foster care upon their return to New Orleans.

In 1992, Bryan came up with the idea to form their own record label, and wanted to name it \"[[Cash Money Records]]\". Bryan and Slim would then travel to nightclubs all over Louisiana to see who was playing and try and recruit artists to the fledgling label. Their first signed artist was a local rapper named Kilo G, who released the label's first ever project, a [[horrorcore]] album titled \"The Sleepwalker\" in 1992.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shawnsetaro/2015/05/05/baby-money-inside-the-early-years-of-birdmans-cash-money-records/|title=Baby Money: Inside The Early Years Of Birdman's Cash Money Records|last=Setaro|first=Shawn|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackeconomics.co.uk/wp/birdman-cash-money-records-the-story/|title=Birdman & Cash Money Records \u2013 The story {{!}} Black Economics|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> Bryan and Slim continued to recruit more and more artists, and Bryan was able to convince his friend and local [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mannie Fresh]] to become Cash Money's in-house producer. By the mid-1990s, Cash Money had grown to a popular independent label in the south, with most of their fanbase located in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. In 1995, Cash Money artist Lil' Slim was introduced to 12-year-old [[Lil Wayne|Dwayne Carter]] at a local block party, and after hearing him rap, brought him to Baby's attention, and soon after Carter was signed to Cash Money as the youngest artist on the label. Carter was placed into a group with another young rapper, 14-year-old [[B.G. (rapper)|Christopher Dorsey]], and the two would be known as \"Baby D\" and \"Lil Doogie\", [[The B.G.'z]]. During this time, Baby himself also began to rap as a member of the group 32 Golds, going by the name B-32.<ref name=\"forbes.com\"/> Despite their regional popularity, the label suffered many setbacks in the mid-1990s, with a number of the \"first generation\" of Cash Money artists leaving the label citing financial issues as the main reason. In addition to this, Kilo G, Pimp Daddy and Yella Boy were all murdered in the mid-90s.<ref name=\"forbes.com\"/> The only two artists to remain were Baby D and Lil Doogie, who renamed themselves [[Lil Wayne]] and [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]] respectively in 1997. The same year, Baby and Slim recruited two new artists, [[Turk (rapper)|Turk]] and [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], and the four were placed together in a new group, known as the [[Hot Boys]].

The lyrics were allegedly used on \"Respect\" and other tracks from the rappers' collaboration album ''Like Father, Like Son'' and Birdman's ''5 * Stunna''.<ref name=\"copyright\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8335706.stm |title= Rapper Wayne sued over copyright |publisher=BBC News |date=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n===Conflict with Lil Wayne===\nOn December 4, 2014, just five days before ''[[Tha Carter V]]'' was scheduled to be released, Wayne issued a statement saying the album would not be released due to his displeasure with Birdman refusing to release the album, although it had been completed. Wayne also expressed his feelings by stating he felt he and his creative partner were being held \"prisoner\". Lil Wayne filed a lawsuit. On January 20, 2015, Wayne self-released ''Sorry 4 the Wait 2'', a sequel to his 2011 mixtape, to compensate for the continued delay of ''Tha Carter V''. Upon the release of ''Sorry for the Wait 2'', it was noted that Wayne disses Birdman and Cash Money Records several times throughout. Birdman was reported to be upset with this. In late January 2015, Lil Wayne filed a $51 million lawsuit against Birdman and Cash Money over the delay of ''Tha Carter V''.\n\nIn January 2015, Wayne stated that when he leaves Cash Money, he would take [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Nicki Minaj]] with him. On June 22, TMZ reported new details on the lawsuit. According to documents filed by Lil Wayne, Birdman and Cash Money had mismanaged [[Young Money]], including Drake and Minaj. The documents alleged that Birdman and Cash Money haven't paid people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} \"Free C5\" became the mantra to get money to the unpaid artist. In June 2015, Wayne joined Jay-Z's Tidal as an artist owner and exclusively released a single on the service titled \"Glory.\" On July 4, 2015, Wayne released Free Weezy Album exclusively through Tidal under Young Money and Republic Records. On July 15, prosecutors allege Birdman and Young Thug conspired to murder Lil Wayne and were involved in the April 26 shooting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} On July 16, Birdman filed a $50 million lawsuit against Jay Z's Tidal streaming service over Lil Wayne's ''Free Weezy Album''. The lawsuit claims that Cash Money Records exclusively owns the rights to Lil Wayne's music, although he is now independent and the label no longer owns these rights.\n\nDue to the frustration of the entire situation, Lil Wayne had tweeted in 2016 how he planned to retire since he felt \u201cmentally defeated\u201d. Many rappers had rushed to his defence and pleaded him to not do so, including [[Kendrick Lamar]], one of the delayed album's features.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, Birdman took to Instagram to announce that he had accepted a plaque in honor of Cash Money Records having sold one billion units.\n\nOn September 13, 2018, it was announced that Young Money was no longer a joint business venture with Cash Money. Ownership of the imprint was granted entirely to Lil Wayne as part of the legal settlements with Birdman that were finalized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Other ventures==\n\n===Oil business===\nIn early 2010, Birdman formed an oil and gas exploration company, Bronald Oil and Gas, LLC. The company was a joint venture founded by Birdman and his brother Slim, and the name was a combination of the brothers' first names, Bryan and Ronald. Evidence of the company's actual business operations was scant, limited mostly to a website and the appearance of a \"pumpjack\" tattoo on the side of Birdman's head.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heatingoil.com/blog/rapper-mogul-birdman-unveils-indie-oil-business123/ |title=Rapper Mogul Birdman Unveils Indie Oil Company |publisher=HeatingOil.com |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2012-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228135618/http://www.heatingoil.com/blog/rapper-mogul-birdman-unveils-indie-oil-business123/ |archivedate=2012-02-28 }}</ref> The website indicated that the company's strategy would be to first develop existing land holdings and seek out new oil and gas leases.

rapper, record executive and entrepreneur. He is the co-founder and public face of [[Cash Money Records]] which he founded with his older brother [[Ronald \"Slim\" Williams]] in 1992. Birdman released his [[Birdman (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 2002, and has gone on to release four solo studio albums in total. Aside from his solo career, he is also a member of the hip-hop duo [[Big Tymers]], along with producer [[Mannie Fresh]].\n\nAlong with his solo work and numerous releases with the Big Tymers, Birdman has released a collaboration album and numerous tracks with fellow rapper and ward [[Lil Wayne]], whom he discovered and took under his wing at age nine. Birdman has also made his name by contributing to the making of YMCMB (Young Money Cash Money Billionaires), a combination of the former's \"Cash Money\" and Lil Wayne's [[Young Money Entertainment]], formerly an imprint under the label. Birdman has also founded the project and hip hop supergroup ''Rich Gang'', bringing attention to artists such as [[Young Thug]] and [[Rich Homie Quan]].\n\n==Early life==\nBirdman was born Bryan Christopher Brooks on February 15, 1969 at [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]] in [[New Orleans]] to Johnnie Williams and Gladys Brooks. For almost a month after his birth, he did not have a given name, which led to people simply calling him \"Baby\", a nickname he retains to this day. Williams did not sign the birth certificate, which led to Bryan taking his mother's surname at birth. As a child, Brooks and his family lived on top of a bar, which was owned by their father. His mother, Gladys, became ill and died in 1975 when Bryan was five years old.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"complex.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/04/birdman-new-video-ms-gladys-featuring-neno-calvin|title=Birdman Honors His Mother in the Video for \"Ms. Gladys\"|website=Complex|accessdate=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"xxlmag.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/05/birdman-mother-shot/|title=Birdman Reveals His Mother Was Shot When He Was 2 Years Old - XXL|website=XXL Mag|accessdate=27 April 2018}}</ref> After their mother's death, Birdman and his siblings Kim, Ronald and Ray were taken in by their uncle and spent two or three years in [[Prince George, British Columbia]], Canada, followed by two years in foster care upon their return to New Orleans.

In 1992, Bryan came up with the idea to form their own record label, and wanted to name it \"[[Cash Money Records]]\". Bryan and Slim would then travel to nightclubs all over Louisiana to see who was playing and try and recruit artists to the fledgling label. Their first signed artist was a local rapper named Kilo G, who released the label's first ever project, a [[horrorcore]] album titled \"The Sleepwalker\" in 1992.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shawnsetaro/2015/05/05/baby-money-inside-the-early-years-of-birdmans-cash-money-records/|title=Baby Money: Inside The Early Years Of Birdman's Cash Money Records|last=Setaro|first=Shawn|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackeconomics.co.uk/wp/birdman-cash-money-records-the-story/|title=Birdman & Cash Money Records \u2013 The story {{!}} Black Economics|last=admin|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> Bryan and Slim continued to recruit more and more artists, and Bryan was able to convince his friend and local [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Mannie Fresh]] to become Cash Money's in-house producer. By the mid-1990s, Cash Money had grown to a popular independent label in the south, with most of their fanbase located in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. In 1995, Cash Money artist Lil' Slim was introduced to 12-year-old [[Lil Wayne|Dwayne Carter]] at a local block party, and after hearing him rap, brought him to Baby's attention, and soon after Carter was signed to Cash Money as the youngest artist on the label. Carter was placed into a group with another young rapper, 14-year-old [[B.G. (rapper)|Christopher Dorsey]], and the two would be known as \"Baby D\" and \"Lil Doogie\", [[The B.G.'z]]. During this time, Baby himself also began to rap as a member of the group 32 Golds, going by the name B-32.<ref name=\"forbes.com\"/> Despite their regional popularity, the label suffered many setbacks in the mid-1990s, with a number of the \"first generation\" of Cash Money artists leaving the label citing financial issues as the main reason. In addition to this, Kilo G, Pimp Daddy and Yella Boy were all murdered in the mid-90s.<ref name=\"forbes.com\"/> The only two artists to remain were Baby D and Lil Doogie, who renamed themselves [[Lil Wayne]] and [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]] respectively in 1997. The same year, Baby and Slim recruited two new artists, [[Turk (rapper)|Turk]] and [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], and the four were placed together in a new group, known as the [[Hot Boys]].

The lawsuit claims that Cash Money Records exclusively owns the rights to Lil Wayne's music, although he is now independent and the label no longer owns these rights.\n\nDue to the frustration of the entire situation, Lil Wayne had tweeted in 2016 how he planned to retire since he felt \u201cmentally defeated\u201d. Many rappers had rushed to his defence and pleaded him to not do so, including [[Kendrick Lamar]], one of the delayed album's features.\n\nOn April 12, 2017, Birdman took to Instagram to announce that he had accepted a plaque in honor of Cash Money Records having sold one billion units.\n\nOn September 13, 2018, it was announced that Young Money was no longer a joint business venture with Cash Money. Ownership of the imprint was granted entirely to Lil Wayne as part of the legal settlements with Birdman that were finalized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Other ventures==\n\n===Oil business===\nIn early 2010, Birdman formed an oil and gas exploration company, Bronald Oil and Gas, LLC. The company was a joint venture founded by Birdman and his brother Slim, and the name was a combination of the brothers' first names, Bryan and Ronald.

In reference to the photo, B.B. King stated, \n\"Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they\u2019d hold up. They had tubes, and they\u2019d get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn\u2019t being made anymore.

Initially, Sarah refused to adapt to her grandfather's traditional cultural practice, such as eating [[Chicken feet#Chinese cuisine|chicken feet]] for breakfast, and the local community who she thought were disgusting. Despite the best efforts of her grandfather to re-create a familiar environment for Sarah by recreating western dishes that Sarah is familiar with using local substitutes, Sarah only ate [[Potato chip|chip]]s that she brought over from New York and refused to communicate with her grandfather.\n\nDefeated, Sarah's grandfather turned to Ah Bao, a neighbour who claims to speak English, to translate his instructions in Chinese and Cantonese to Sarah. Annoyed but later amused at his poor command of English, Sarah starts to take an interest in the surrounding neighbourhood. She also reveals that she can actually understand and speak Chinese, much to her grandfather's relief. Slowly, she starts interacting with the children around the neighbourhood, who included her in their activities, and starts adapting to the local environment. She also began to interact with her grandfather and a bond starts to form between them.\n\nBetween the scenes of interactions between Sarah and her grandfather, there were also flashbacks that revealed the strained relationship between Sarah's mother and grandfather. It was revealed that Sarah's mother, unmarried and pregnant with Sarah, had a strong argument with her father (Sarah's grandfather) who was strongly against her moving to New York City to live with her boyfriend. She disregarded his advice and ran away from home, never contacting him until asking if Sarah can stay with him, while pursuing a career as a fashion designer whilst balancing her role of a single mother after Sarah's father abandoned her.\n\nOver time, the bond between Sarah and her grandfather deepened, despite occasional tension created by differences between her contemporary, [[social media]]-influenced lifestyle and her grandfather's conservative values. Sarah had warmed to the community so much that as the time draws closer to her departure, she became reluctant to leave. Above all, she did not want to leave her grandfather alone, as she had learnt of his various health ailments that he had hid from everyone over the years. Sarah thus prodded her grandfather to embrace new media so that she could communicate with him overseas and also tried desperately to get her mother and grandfather to reconcile.\n\nBefore Sarah's departure, Sarah's grandfather got Ah Bao to film a video to give to Sarah's mother when he dies. Inside, he apologised for not being a good father, his admiration for raising Sarah single-handedly as well as him bequeathing assets to her and Sarah. Ah Bao, defying his promise to keep the video secret, sends the touching video to Sarah's mother. Touched by his words, Sarah's mother hurriedly returns home and reconciles with her father after many years of estrangement.\n\nIt was shown in the film's closing credits that Sarah's grandfather flew to New York together with Sarah and her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[imdbname:7552743|Sarah Tan Qin Lin]] (of [[Kampilan]] films) as Sarah Lim Si Jia\n* [[Ti Lung]] as Lim Chun Gen, Sarah's grandfather\n* [[Jessica Hsuan]] as Sophia Lin, Sarah's mother\n* Jayson Tan as Ah Bao, Sarah's friend\n* Lenna Lim as Ivy\n\n==Themes==\nThe director herself stated that ''The Kid from the Big Apple'' was about family values and wanted to convey the message of filial piety through the film.<ref name=\"nst20160909\" /> Specifically, she wanted to portray the importance of communication between grandparents and their grandchildren.<ref name=\"nst20160909\" /> The importance of father-daughter relationships is also conveyed in the film.<ref name=\"mypaper20160310\">{{cite web  |url= http://mypaper.sg/chinese-lifestyle/lao-wai-gong-yu-shang-xiao-sun-nu-20160310 | title= \u8001\u5916\u516c\u9047\u4e0a\u5c0f\u5b59\u5973 | author=\u7f57\u7471\u73b2 |date=10 March 2016|accessdate= 1 November 2016|work=[[Mypaper]]|language=zh}}</ref> Actress Sarah Tan said that \"I think after watching this, you will think of home as well\".<ref name=\"star20160323\">{{cite web  |url= http://www.star2.com/entertainment/movies/movie-news/2016/03/23/the-kid-from-the-big-apple-is-going-to-be-a-star/ | title= This tween is going to be a star one day | author=Cheang, Michael |date=23 March 2016|accessdate= 1 November 2016|work=[[Star Media Group (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref> For promoting family values, ''The Kid from the Big Apple'' won the Special Jury Awards at the 28th edition of the Malaysian Film Festival.<ref name=\"nst20160909\" />\n\nTeong also portrayed traditional Malaysian practices in this film as a reaction to her perception that the \"actual (Malaysian traditional) culture and tradition is being forgotten and ignored, just for the sake of making profit\".<ref name=\"star20160310\" /> As such, the film was completely filmed in Malaysia and features traditional cultural practices, superstitions and dialects.<ref name=\"star20160310\" /> However, the show was deliberately not \"too Malaysian\" as the director felt that the film had the potential for an overseas release.<ref name=\"star20160310\" />\n\n==Production==\n''The Kid from the Big Apple'' is the directorial debut of Jess Teong, who had previously worked in the entertainment industry as a singer, model, actress and film producer at various stages in her career. The film was conceived because Teong felt angry about the rampant over-reliance of smartphones and over-commercialization of local cultural practices in Malaysia after returning to Malaysia from an overseas work stint. Thus, the script of the movie was partly influenced by its director's own childhood experience.<ref name=\"star20160310\" />\n\nAfter almost 2 years of searching for a suitable child actress to portray Sarah, she met Qin Lin, and felt that she was perfectly suited for this role. This was because Qin Lin had both met Teong's criteria such as \"not being too technical with her acting\" and had the appropriate personality for the role. However, Teong had to spend 2 months training Qin Lin to prepare her for her bilingual role. The role is Qin Lin's first role in a full-length feature film. She had previously made her acting debut on [[Astro Xiao Tai Yang]] in 2014.<ref name=\"star20160323\" />\n\nMost of the scenes in ''The Kid from the Big Apple'' were filmed at an apartment block in Taman Yulek, [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur]].<ref name=\"star20160310\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Kid from the Big Apple'' made its debut at the 7th Macau International Movie Festival in December 2015, where it won several film awards.<ref name=\"malaymail20160309\" /> The film made its cinematic debut in its home market of [[Malaysia]] and Singapore on 10 March 2016.<ref name=\"st20160309\">{{cite news|author= Wai Yee, Yip |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/ti-lung-loves-being-a-granddad |title=Ti Lung loves being a granddad |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |date= 9 March 2016 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref> It was subsequently released internationally in [[Taiwan]] and Hong Kong on 11 March 2016 and 21 April 2016 respectively.<ref name=\"malaymail20160309\">{{cite news|url=http://movie.mtm.mo/index.php?act=pps&smid=68&dyj=11 |title=Award-winning \u2018The Kid from The Big Apple\u2019 to open in local cinemas tomorrow |newspaper=Malay Mail Online |date= 9 March 2016 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical Response===\nThe film received mixed reviews by film critics.

The film stars [[imdbname:7552743|Sarah Tan]] as Sarah, an 11-year-old girl from New York City who was forced to move to rural [[Malaysia]] to stay with her grandfather. The film garnered several awards at the [[7th Macau International Movie Festival]] and the 28th [[Malaysian Film Festival]].<ref name=\"star20160310\">{{cite web  |url= http://www.star2.com/entertainment/movies/movie-news/2016/03/10/the-kid-from-the-big-apple-will-melt-your-hearts/ | title= The Kid From The Big Apple will melt your hearts | author=Cheang, Michael |date=10 March 2016|accessdate= 1 November 2016|work=[[Star Media Group (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref><ref name=\"nst20160909\">{{cite web  |url= http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/09/172086/28th-malaysian-film-festival-big-names-big-wins| title= 28th Malaysian Film Festival: Big names, big wins | author=Chua, Dennis |date=9 September 2016|accessdate= 1 November 2016|work=[[New Straits Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSarah reluctantly moved to Malaysia to stay with a grandfather whom she had never met before as her mother had to visit China to resolve work-related problems. Initially, Sarah refused to adapt to her grandfather's traditional cultural practice, such as eating [[Chicken feet#Chinese cuisine|chicken feet]] for breakfast, and the local community who she thought were disgusting. Despite the best efforts of her grandfather to re-create a familiar environment for Sarah by recreating western dishes that Sarah is familiar with using local substitutes, Sarah only ate [[Potato chip|chip]]s that she brought over from New York and refused to communicate with her grandfather.\n\nDefeated, Sarah's grandfather turned to Ah Bao, a neighbour who claims to speak English, to translate his instructions in Chinese and Cantonese to Sarah. Annoyed but later amused at his poor command of English, Sarah starts to take an interest in the surrounding neighbourhood. She also reveals that she can actually understand and speak Chinese, much to her grandfather's relief. Slowly, she starts interacting with the children around the neighbourhood, who included her in their activities, and starts adapting to the local environment. She also began to interact with her grandfather and a bond starts to form between them.\n\nBetween the scenes of interactions between Sarah and her grandfather, there were also flashbacks that revealed the strained relationship between Sarah's mother and grandfather. It was revealed that Sarah's mother, unmarried and pregnant with Sarah, had a strong argument with her father (Sarah's grandfather) who was strongly against her moving to New York City to live with her boyfriend. She disregarded his advice and ran away from home, never contacting him until asking if Sarah can stay with him, while pursuing a career as a fashion designer whilst balancing her role of a single mother after Sarah's father abandoned her.\n\nOver time, the bond between Sarah and her grandfather deepened, despite occasional tension created by differences between her contemporary, [[social media]]-influenced lifestyle and her grandfather's conservative values. Sarah had warmed to the community so much that as the time draws closer to her departure, she became reluctant to leave. Above all, she did not want to leave her grandfather alone, as she had learnt of his various health ailments that he had hid from everyone over the years. Sarah thus prodded her grandfather to embrace new media so that she could communicate with him overseas and also tried desperately to get her mother and grandfather to reconcile.\n\nBefore Sarah's departure, Sarah's grandfather got Ah Bao to film a video to give to Sarah's mother when he dies. Inside, he apologised for not being a good father, his admiration for raising Sarah single-handedly as well as him bequeathing assets to her and Sarah. Ah Bao, defying his promise to keep the video secret, sends the touching video to Sarah's mother. Touched by his words, Sarah's mother hurriedly returns home and reconciles with her father after many years of estrangement.\n\nIt was shown in the film's closing credits that Sarah's grandfather flew to New York together with Sarah and her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[imdbname:7552743|Sarah Tan Qin Lin]] (of [[Kampilan]] films) as Sarah Lim Si Jia\n* [[Ti Lung]] as Lim Chun Gen, Sarah's grandfather\n* [[Jessica Hsuan]] as Sophia Lin, Sarah's mother\n* Jayson Tan as Ah Bao, Sarah's friend\n* Lenna Lim as Ivy\n\n==Themes==\nThe director herself stated that ''The Kid from the Big Apple'' was about family values and wanted to convey the message of filial piety through the film.<ref name=\"nst20160909\" /> Specifically, she wanted to portray the importance of communication between grandparents and their grandchildren.<ref name=\"nst20160909\" /> The importance of father-daughter relationships is also conveyed in the film.<ref name=\"mypaper20160310\">{{cite web  |url= http://mypaper.sg/chinese-lifestyle/lao-wai-gong-yu-shang-xiao-sun-nu-20160310 | title= \u8001\u5916\u516c\u9047\u4e0a\u5c0f\u5b59\u5973 | author=\u7f57\u7471\u73b2 |date=10 March 2016|accessdate= 1 November 2016|work=[[Mypaper]]|language=zh}}</ref> Actress Sarah Tan said that \"I think after watching this, you will think of home as well\".<ref name=\"star20160323\">{{cite web  |url= http://www.star2.com/entertainment/movies/movie-news/2016/03/23/the-kid-from-the-big-apple-is-going-to-be-a-star/ | title= This tween is going to be a star one day | author=Cheang, Michael |date=23 March 2016|accessdate= 1 November 2016|work=[[Star Media Group (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}</ref> For promoting family values, ''The Kid from the Big Apple'' won the Special Jury Awards at the 28th edition of the Malaysian Film Festival.<ref name=\"nst20160909\" />\n\nTeong also portrayed traditional Malaysian practices in this film as a reaction to her perception that the \"actual (Malaysian traditional) culture and tradition is being forgotten and ignored, just for the sake of making profit\".<ref name=\"star20160310\" /> As such, the film was completely filmed in Malaysia and features traditional cultural practices, superstitions and dialects.<ref name=\"star20160310\" /> However, the show was deliberately not \"too Malaysian\" as the director felt that the film had the potential for an overseas release.<ref name=\"star20160310\" />\n\n==Production==\n''The Kid from the Big Apple'' is the directorial debut of Jess Teong, who had previously worked in the entertainment industry as a singer, model, actress and film producer at various stages in her career. The film was conceived because Teong felt angry about the rampant over-reliance of smartphones and over-commercialization of local cultural practices in Malaysia after returning to Malaysia from an overseas work stint. Thus, the script of the movie was partly influenced by its director's own childhood experience.<ref name=\"star20160310\" />\n\nAfter almost 2 years of searching for a suitable child actress to portray Sarah, she met Qin Lin, and felt that she was perfectly suited for this role. This was because Qin Lin had both met Teong's criteria such as \"not being too technical with her acting\" and had the appropriate personality for the role. However, Teong had to spend 2 months training Qin Lin to prepare her for her bilingual role. The role is Qin Lin's first role in a full-length feature film. She had previously made her acting debut on [[Astro Xiao Tai Yang]] in 2014.<ref name=\"star20160323\" />\n\nMost of the scenes in ''The Kid from the Big Apple'' were filmed at an apartment block in Taman Yulek, [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur]].<ref name=\"star20160310\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Kid from the Big Apple'' made its debut at the 7th Macau International Movie Festival in December 2015, where it won several film awards.<ref name=\"malaymail20160309\" /> The film made its cinematic debut in its home market of [[Malaysia]] and Singapore on 10 March 2016.<ref name=\"st20160309\">{{cite news|author= Wai Yee, Yip |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/ti-lung-loves-being-a-granddad |title=Ti Lung loves being a granddad |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |date= 9 March 2016 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref> It was subsequently released internationally in [[Taiwan]] and Hong Kong on 11 March 2016 and 21 April 2016 respectively.<ref name=\"malaymail20160309\">{{cite news|url=http://movie.mtm.mo/index.php?act=pps&smid=68&dyj=11 |title=Award-winning \u2018The Kid from The Big Apple\u2019 to open in local cinemas tomorrow |newspaper=Malay Mail Online |date= 9 March 2016 |accessdate=1 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical Response===\nThe film received mixed reviews by film critics.
