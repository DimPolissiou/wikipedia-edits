The word ''the'' as in phrases like \"the more the better\", has a distinct origin and etymology and by chance has evolved to be identical to the definite article.<ref>\"the, adv.1.\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2016. Web. 11 March 2016.</ref> (See the Wiktionary entry ''[[wikt:the#Etymology 2|the]]''.)\n\n=== Geographical names ===\nAn area in which the use or non-use of ''the'' is sometimes problematic is with [[toponym|geographic name]]s. Names of rivers, seas, mountain ranges, deserts, island groups ([[archipelago]]es) and the like are generally used with the definite article (''the Rhine'', ''the North Sea'', ''the Alps'', ''the Sahara'', ''the [[Hebrides]]''). Names of continents, individual islands, countries, regions, administrative units, cities and towns mostly do not take the article (''Europe'', ''[[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]'', ''Austria'', ''Scandinavia'', ''Yorkshire'', ''Madrid''). However, there are certain exceptions:\n\n* Countries and territories the names of which derive from common nouns such as \"kingdom\" or \"republic\" take the article: ''the United States'', ''the United Kingdom'', ''the Soviet Union'', ''the Czech Republic''.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/grammarandbeyond/newsletter/2011/11/using-the-with-the-names-of-countries Using \u2018the\u2019 with the Names of Countries]</ref>\n* Countries and territories the names of which derive from \"island\" or \"land\", however, only take the definite article if they represent a plural noun: ''the Netherlands'', ''the [[Falkland Islands]]'', ''the [[Faroe Islands]]'', and ''the Cayman Islands'', even ''the Philippines'' or ''the Comoros'' do, though the plural noun \"islands\" is omitted there. The (singular) ''Greenland'' on the other hand does not take the definite article, and neither does ''[[Christmas Island]]'' or ''[[Norfolk Island]]''. Exceptions include \"the North Island\" (of New Zealand).\n* Certain countries and regions the names of which derive from mountain ranges, rivers, deserts, etc., are sometimes used with an article even though in the singular (''the Lebanon'', ''the Sudan'', ''the Yukon''),<ref>Swan, Michael ''How English Works'', p. 25</ref> but this usage is declining, although [[the Gambia]] remains the recommended name of that country. Since the independence of [[Ukraine]] (formerly sometimes called ''the Ukraine''), most style guides have advised dropping the article<ref>[http://www.infoukes.com/faq/the_ukraine/ Ukraine or \"the Ukraine\"?] by Andrew Gregorovich, infoukes.com</ref> (in some other languages there is a [[Name of Ukraine#Preposition usage in Ukrainian, Russian and other Slavic languages|similar issue involving prepositions]]). Use of ''the Argentine'' for [[Argentina]] is considered old-fashioned.\n*Some names include an article, such as [[the Bronx]] or [[The Hague]]. \n*Names beginning with a common noun followed by ''of'' may take the article, as in ''the [[Isle of Wight]]'' or ''the [[Isle of Portland]]'' (compare ''Christmas Island''). The same applies to names of institutions: ''Cambridge University'', but ''the University of Cambridge''.\n\n== Abbreviations for \"the\" and \"that\" ==\n[[File:Barred Thorn after \u00c6lfric.svg|thumb|Barred thorn (after \u00c6lfric)]]\nSince \"the\" is one of the most frequently used words in English, at various times short abbreviations for it have been found:\n\n*Barred [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]:&nbsp;the earliest abbreviation, it is used in manuscripts in the [[Old English language]]. It is the letter '''[[\u00fe]]''' with a bold horizontal stroke through the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]], and it represents the word ''\u00fe\u00e6t'', meaning \"the\" or \"that\" (neuter [[nominative|nom.]] / [[accusative|acc.]]).\n*'''\u00fe\u0364''' and '''\u00fe\u036d'''&nbsp;([[\u00fe]] with a superscript ''e'' or ''t'') appear in [[Middle English]] manuscripts for \"\u00fee\" and \"\u00feat\" respectively.\n*'''y\u0364''' and '''y\u036d'''&nbsp;are developed from ''\u00fe\u0364'' and ''\u00fe\u036d'' and appear in Early Modern manuscripts and in print (see [[#Ye form|''Ye'' form]] below).\n\nOccasional proposals have been made by individuals for an abbreviation.  In 1916, Legros & Grant included in their classic printers' handbook ''Typographical Printing-Surfaces'', a proposal for a letter similar to '''\u0126''' to represent \"Th\", thus abbreviating \"the\" to \u0127e.<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fontblog/archive/2006/08/10/missed-opportunity-for-ligatures.aspx Missed Opportunity for Ligatures]</ref>  Why they did not propose reintroducing to the English language \"''\u00fe''\", for which limited quantities of blocks may have already been available for use in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] texts, or the ''y\u0364'' form is unknown.\n\n=== ''Ye'' form ===\n{{See also|Ye olde}}\nIn Middle English, ''the'' (\u00fee) was frequently abbreviated as a ''\u00fe'' with a small ''e'' above it, similar to the abbreviation for ''that'', which was a ''\u00fe'' with a small ''t'' above it. During the latter [[Middle English]] and [[Early Modern English]] periods, the letter [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] (\u00fe) in its common script, or [[cursive]] form, came to resemble a ''y'' shape. As a result, the use of a ''y'' with an ''e'' above it ([[File:EME ye.svg|10px]]) as an abbreviation became common. This can still be seen in reprints of the 1611 edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in places such as Romans 15:29, or in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Historically, the article was never pronounced with a ''y'' sound, even when so written.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:English grammar]]\n[[Category:English words]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|English definite article}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Other uses|The (disambiguation)}}\n{{technical reasons|The #1s|the band|The No.1s}}\n'''''The''''' {{IPAc-en|\u00f0|\u0259|,_|\u00f0|i\u02d0|audio=En-us-the-unstressed.ogg}} is a grammatical [[Article (grammar)|article]] in [[English language|English]], denoting persons or things already mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners or readers.

This is different from many other languages which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers.\n\n== Pronunciation ==\nIn most dialects, \"the\" is pronounced as {{IPA|/\u00f0\u0259/}} (with the [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} followed by a [[schwa]]) when followed by a [[consonant]] sound, and as {{IPA|/\u00f0i\u02d0/}} (homophonous with ''[[thee]]'') when followed by a vowel sound or used as an [[Weak and strong forms in English|emphatic form]].<ref name=mw>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the|work=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary|title=the \u2013 definition}}</ref> In modern [[American English]], however, there is an increasing tendency to limit the usage of the latter pronunciation to emphatic purposes and use the former even before a vowel.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladefoged|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter Ladefoged|last2=Johnson|first2=Keith|year=2010|title=A Course in Phonetics|edition=6th|place=Boston|publisher=Wadsworth|page=110}}</ref> The same change is happening in [[New Zealand English]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hay|first1=Jennifer|year=2008|title=New Zealand English|place=Edinburgh|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|page=44}}</ref>\n\nIn some Northern England [[dialect]]s of English, ''the'' is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u032a\u0259]}} (with a [[voiceless dental plosive|dental t]]) or as a [[glottal stop]], usually written in [[eye dialect]] as {{angbr|t}}; in some dialects it reduces to nothing. This is known as [[definite article reduction]].\n\nIn dialects that do not have the voiced dental fricative {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, ''the'' is pronounced with the [[voiced dental plosive]], as in {{IPA|/d\u032a\u0259/}} or {{IPA|/d\u032ai\u02d0/}}).\n\n== Etymology ==\n''The'' and ''that'' are common developments from the same [[Old English language|Old English]] system. Old English had a definite article ''[[:wikt:se#Old English|se]]'' (in the masculine [[grammatical gender|gender]]), ''[[:wikt:seo#Old English|s\u0113o]]'' (feminine), and [[That|''\u00fe\u00e6t'']] (neuter). In [[Middle English]], these had all [[merger (phonology)|merged]] into ''\u00fee'', the ancestor of the [[Modern English]] word ''the''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=the&allowed_in_frame=0|title=''The'' and ''That'' Etymologies|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nThe principles of the use of the definite article in English are described under \"[[English articles#Use of articles|Use of articles]]\".  The word ''the'' as in phrases like \"the more the better\", has a distinct origin and etymology and by chance has evolved to be identical to the definite article.<ref>\"the, adv.1.\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2016. Web. 11 March 2016.</ref> (See the Wiktionary entry ''[[wikt:the#Etymology 2|the]]''.)\n\n=== Geographical names ===\nAn area in which the use or non-use of ''the'' is sometimes problematic is with [[toponym|geographic name]]s. Names of rivers, seas, mountain ranges, deserts, island groups ([[archipelago]]es) and the like are generally used with the definite article (''the Rhine'', ''the North Sea'', ''the Alps'', ''the Sahara'', ''the [[Hebrides]]''). Names of continents, individual islands, countries, regions, administrative units, cities and towns mostly do not take the article (''Europe'', ''[[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]'', ''Austria'', ''Scandinavia'', ''Yorkshire'', ''Madrid''). However, there are certain exceptions:\n\n* Countries and territories the names of which derive from common nouns such as \"kingdom\" or \"republic\" take the article: ''the United States'', ''the United Kingdom'', ''the Soviet Union'', ''the Czech Republic''.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/grammarandbeyond/newsletter/2011/11/using-the-with-the-names-of-countries Using \u2018the\u2019 with the Names of Countries]</ref>\n* Countries and territories the names of which derive from \"island\" or \"land\", however, only take the definite article if they represent a plural noun: ''the Netherlands'', ''the [[Falkland Islands]]'', ''the [[Faroe Islands]]'', and ''the Cayman Islands'', even ''the Philippines'' or ''the Comoros'' do, though the plural noun \"islands\" is omitted there. The (singular) ''Greenland'' on the other hand does not take the definite article, and neither does ''[[Christmas Island]]'' or ''[[Norfolk Island]]''. Exceptions include \"the North Island\" (of New Zealand).\n* Certain countries and regions the names of which derive from mountain ranges, rivers, deserts, etc., are sometimes used with an article even though in the singular (''the Lebanon'', ''the Sudan'', ''the Yukon''),<ref>Swan, Michael ''How English Works'', p. 25</ref> but this usage is declining, although [[the Gambia]] remains the recommended name of that country. Since the independence of [[Ukraine]] (formerly sometimes called ''the Ukraine''), most style guides have advised dropping the article<ref>[http://www.infoukes.com/faq/the_ukraine/ Ukraine or \"the Ukraine\"?] by Andrew Gregorovich, infoukes.com</ref> (in some other languages there is a [[Name of Ukraine#Preposition usage in Ukrainian, Russian and other Slavic languages|similar issue involving prepositions]]). Use of ''the Argentine'' for [[Argentina]] is considered old-fashioned.\n*Some names include an article, such as [[the Bronx]] or [[The Hague]]. \n*Names beginning with a common noun followed by ''of'' may take the article, as in ''the [[Isle of Wight]]'' or ''the [[Isle of Portland]]'' (compare ''Christmas Island''). The same applies to names of institutions: ''Cambridge University'', but ''the University of Cambridge''.\n\n== Abbreviations for \"the\" and \"that\" ==\n[[File:Barred Thorn after \u00c6lfric.svg|thumb|Barred thorn (after \u00c6lfric)]]\nSince \"the\" is one of the most frequently used words in English, at various times short abbreviations for it have been found:\n\n*Barred [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]:&nbsp;the earliest abbreviation, it is used in manuscripts in the [[Old English language]]. It is the letter '''[[\u00fe]]''' with a bold horizontal stroke through the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]], and it represents the word ''\u00fe\u00e6t'', meaning \"the\" or \"that\" (neuter [[nominative|nom.]] / [[accusative|acc.]]).\n*'''\u00fe\u0364''' and '''\u00fe\u036d'''&nbsp;([[\u00fe]] with a superscript ''e'' or ''t'') appear in [[Middle English]] manuscripts for \"\u00fee\" and \"\u00feat\" respectively.\n*'''y\u0364''' and '''y\u036d'''&nbsp;are developed from ''\u00fe\u0364'' and ''\u00fe\u036d'' and appear in Early Modern manuscripts and in print (see [[#Ye form|''Ye'' form]] below).\n\nOccasional proposals have been made by individuals for an abbreviation.  In 1916, Legros & Grant included in their classic printers' handbook ''Typographical Printing-Surfaces'', a proposal for a letter similar to '''\u0126''' to represent \"Th\", thus abbreviating \"the\" to \u0127e.<ref>[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fontblog/archive/2006/08/10/missed-opportunity-for-ligatures.aspx Missed Opportunity for Ligatures]</ref>  Why they did not propose reintroducing to the English language \"''\u00fe''\", for which limited quantities of blocks may have already been available for use in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] texts, or the ''y\u0364'' form is unknown.\n\n=== ''Ye'' form ===\n{{See also|Ye olde}}\nIn Middle English, ''the'' (\u00fee) was frequently abbreviated as a ''\u00fe'' with a small ''e'' above it, similar to the abbreviation for ''that'', which was a ''\u00fe'' with a small ''t'' above it. During the latter [[Middle English]] and [[Early Modern English]] periods, the letter [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] (\u00fe) in its common script, or [[cursive]] form, came to resemble a ''y'' shape. As a result, the use of a ''y'' with an ''e'' above it ([[File:EME ye.svg|10px]]) as an abbreviation became common. This can still be seen in reprints of the 1611 edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] in places such as Romans 15:29, or in the [[Mayflower Compact]]. Historically, the article was never pronounced with a ''y'' sound, even when so written.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:English grammar]]\n[[Category:English words]]\n", "name_user": "94.49.210.94", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEtymology)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The"}
