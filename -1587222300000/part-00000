On this date, during his helicopter insertion for a reconnaissance and time sensitive targeting close air support mission, Sergeant Chapman's aircraft came under heavy machine gun fire and received a direct hit from a rocket propelled grenade which caused a United States Navy sea-air-land team member to fall from the aircraft. Though heavily damaged, the aircraft egressed the area and made an emergency landing seven kilometers away. Once on the ground Sergeant Chapman established communication with an AC-130 gunship to insure the area was secure while providing close air support coverage for the entire team. He then directed the gunship to begin the search for the missing team member. He requested, coordinated, and controlled the helicopter that extracted the stranded team and aircrew members. These actions limited the exposure of the aircrew and team to hostile fire. Without regard for his own life Sergeant Chapman volunteered to rescue his missing team member from an enemy strong hold. Shortly after insertion, the team made contact with the enemy. Sergeant Chapman engaged and killed two enemy personnel. He continued to advance reaching the enemy position then engaged a second enemy position, a dug-in machine gun nest. At this time, the rescue team came under effective enemy fire from three directions. From close range he exchanged fire with the enemy from minimum personal cover until he succumbed to multiple wounds. His engagement and destruction of the first enemy position and advancement on the second position enabled his team to move to cover and break enemy contact. In his own words, his Navy sea-air-land team leader credits Sergeant Chapman unequivocally with saving the lives of the entire rescue team.

Upon reaching the bunker, Sergeant Chapman assaulted and cleared the position, killing all enemy occupants. With complete disregard for his own life, Sergeant Chapman deliberately moved from cover only 12 meters from the enemy, and exposed himself once again to attack a second bunker, from which an emplaced machine gun was firing on his team. During this assault from an exposed position directly in the line of intense fire, Sergeant Chapman was struck and injured by enemy fire. Despite severe, mortal wounds, he continued to fight relentlessly, sustaining a violent engagement with multiple enemy personnel before making the ultimate sacrifice.

On this date, during his helicopter insertion for a reconnaissance and time sensitive targeting close air support mission, Sergeant Chapman's aircraft came under heavy machine gun fire and received a direct hit from a rocket propelled grenade which caused a United States Navy sea-air-land team member to fall from the aircraft. Though heavily damaged, the aircraft egressed the area and made an emergency landing seven kilometers away. Once on the ground Sergeant Chapman established communication with an AC-130 gunship to insure the area was secure while providing close air support coverage for the entire team. He then directed the gunship to begin the search for the missing team member. He requested, coordinated, and controlled the helicopter that extracted the stranded team and aircrew members. These actions limited the exposure of the aircrew and team to hostile fire. Without regard for his own life Sergeant Chapman volunteered to rescue his missing team member from an enemy strong hold. Shortly after insertion, the team made contact with the enemy. Sergeant Chapman engaged and killed two enemy personnel. He continued to advance reaching the enemy position then engaged a second enemy position, a dug-in machine gun nest. At this time, the rescue team came under effective enemy fire from three directions. From close range he exchanged fire with the enemy from minimum personal cover until he succumbed to multiple wounds. His engagement and destruction of the first enemy position and advancement on the second position enabled his team to move to cover and break enemy contact. In his own words, his Navy sea-air-land team leader credits Sergeant Chapman unequivocally with saving the lives of the entire rescue team.

An example is the introduction of [[invasive species]], like the [[Asian carp]] introduced into the [[United States|US]], which has become a nuisance due to unexpected proliferation and behaviour.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/resilience-bullying/201008/principle-one-road-hell-is-paved-good-intentions |journal=Psychology Today |series=Resilience to Bullying |first1=Izzy |last1=Kalman |title=Principle Number One: The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |date=August 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother meaning of the phrase is that individuals may have the intention to undertake good actions but nevertheless fail to take action.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/the+road+to+hell+is+paved+with+good+intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.com/[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |work=The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy |edition=Third  |year=2005 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org/[[Cambridge University Press]] |work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus |edition=Third |year=2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref> This inaction may be due to [[procrastination]], [[laziness]] or other subversive vice.<ref>{{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGiREb_p238C&pg=PA33 |title=101 American English proverbs: understanding language and culture through commonly used sayings |first1=Harry |last1=Collis |first2=Mario |last2=Risso |chapter=The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |isbn=9780844254128 |year=1992 |location=Lincolnwood, Ill |publisher=Passport Books |url=https://archive.org/details/101americanengli00harr_0 }}</ref> As such, the saying is an admonishment that a good intention is meaningless unless followed through.<ref>{{cite book |title=Psychosocial Basis of Health Care |first1=Charles L., editor |last1=Bowden |first2=Alvin George, editor |last2=Burstein |page=98 |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |year=1983 |isbn=0-683-00993-1}}</ref>\n\nMoral certainty can be used to justify the harm done by failing policies and actions. Those with good intentions believe their practices are good for the group; it is self-evident to them. They justify [[collateral damage]] in the belief they do a greater good. The [[Nazi concentration camps]] were created to hold so-called \"racially undesirable elements\" of German society. The [[GULAG]] system was introduced in order to isolate disloyal elements not contributing to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The [[Inquisition]], though much lesser in scale than the previous two examples, was established to eradicate [[heretics]] in religious states. The harm done is clearly seen, and acknowledged, but is written off as a 'price worth paying'.\n\nOn a personal level, taking a subjectively \"good action\" can land one in a horrific emotional and/or physical state of being, e.g., a soldier goes off to war to fight for the subjective good of their country and ends up with  [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].\n\n==Studies==\n[[Psychology|Psychological]] studies of the effect of intention upon task completion by professors [[Peter Gollwitzer]], Paschal Sheeran and Sheina Orbell indicate that there is some truth in the proverb.<ref>{{citation |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=38 |first1=Peter |last1=Gollwitzer |first2=Paschal |last2=Sheeran |chapter=Implementation intentions and goal achievement |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Qhwr7jGyFsC&pg=PA70 |isbn=9780120152384 |date=2006-05-30}}</ref>  [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]] are especially prone to having their [[Implementation intention|intention]]s backfire in this way.<ref>{{citation |title=Implementation Intentions, Perfectionism, and Goal Progress: Perhaps the Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=31 |pages=902&ndash;912 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/0146167204272311 |pmid=15951362 |issue=7 |last1=Powers |first1=T.

The modern expression, \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\", was first published in [[Henry G. Bohn]]'s ''A Hand-book of Proverbs'' in 1855.<ref>{{citation |url=https://archive.org/details/ahandbookprover01raygoog/page/n525 |title=A Hand-book of Proverbs |first1=Henry |last1=Bohn |year=1855}}</ref> An earlier iteration, \"Hell is full of good meanings and wishes\", was published in 1670 in ''A Collection of English Proverbs'' collected by [[John Ray]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://archive.org/details/acompleatcollec00raygoog/page/n33 |title=A Collection of English Proverbs |first1=John |last1=Ray |year=1670}}</ref> The earliest known text resembling this phrase occurs in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'': \"facilis descensus Averno (the descent to hell is easy)\".<ref>{{citation |title=Analogous Proverbs In Ten Languages |chapter=Hell is paved with good intentions |first1=Mrs E. B. |last1=Mawr |year=1885 |publisher=Elliot Stock}}</ref>\n\nA biblical resemblance can be found in [[Ecclesiasticus]] 21:10, \"The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.\"<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bible.com/bible/546/SIR.21.10.KJVA |title=King James Bible}}</ref> The proverb is commonly misattributed to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] who supposedly wrote ({{circa}} 1150), \"''L'enfer est plein de bonnes volont\u00e9s ou d\u00e9sirs''\" (hell is full of good wishes or desires).<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9re1vfFh04sC&pg=PA542 |title=The American Heritage dictionary of idioms |first1=Christine |last1=Ammer |isbn=9780395727744 |year=1997}}</ref> This citation was made in 1640, some five hundred years after his death, and this text has not been found in any of his published works.\n\nAnother resemblance also can be found in one [[Hadith]] that [[Muhammad]] said: \"Paradise is surrounded by hardships, and the Fire is surrounded by desires.\"\n\n==Meaning==\nA common interpretation of the saying is that wrongdoings or evil actions are often masked by good intentions; or even that good intentions, when acted upon, may have [[unintended consequences]]. An example is the introduction of [[invasive species]], like the [[Asian carp]] introduced into the [[United States|US]], which has become a nuisance due to unexpected proliferation and behaviour.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/resilience-bullying/201008/principle-one-road-hell-is-paved-good-intentions |journal=Psychology Today |series=Resilience to Bullying |first1=Izzy |last1=Kalman |title=Principle Number One: The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |date=August 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother meaning of the phrase is that individuals may have the intention to undertake good actions but nevertheless fail to take action.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/the+road+to+hell+is+paved+with+good+intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.com/[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |work=The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy |edition=Third  |year=2005 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-intentions |title=The road to hell is paved with good intentions |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org/[[Cambridge University Press]] |work=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus |edition=Third |year=2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref> This inaction may be due to [[procrastination]], [[laziness]] or other subversive vice.<ref>{{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGiREb_p238C&pg=PA33 |title=101 American English proverbs: understanding language and culture through commonly used sayings |first1=Harry |last1=Collis |first2=Mario |last2=Risso |chapter=The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions |isbn=9780844254128 |year=1992 |location=Lincolnwood, Ill |publisher=Passport Books |url=https://archive.org/details/101americanengli00harr_0 }}</ref> As such, the saying is an admonishment that a good intention is meaningless unless followed through.<ref>{{cite book |title=Psychosocial Basis of Health Care |first1=Charles L., editor |last1=Bowden |first2=Alvin George, editor |last2=Burstein |page=98 |publisher=Williams & Wilkins |year=1983 |isbn=0-683-00993-1}}</ref>\n\nMoral certainty can be used to justify the harm done by failing policies and actions. Those with good intentions believe their practices are good for the group; it is self-evident to them. They justify [[collateral damage]] in the belief they do a greater good. The [[Nazi concentration camps]] were created to hold so-called \"racially undesirable elements\" of German society. The [[GULAG]] system was introduced in order to isolate disloyal elements not contributing to the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The [[Inquisition]] was established to eradicate [[heretics]] in religious states. The harm done is clearly seen, and acknowledged, but is written off as a 'price worth paying'.\n\nOn a personal level, taking a subjectively \"good action\" can land one in a horrific emotional and/or physical state of being, e.g., a soldier goes off to war to fight for the subjective good of their country and ends up with  [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].\n\n==Studies==\n[[Psychology|Psychological]] studies of the effect of intention upon task completion by professors [[Peter Gollwitzer]], Paschal Sheeran and Sheina Orbell indicate that there is some truth in the proverb.<ref>{{citation |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=38 |first1=Peter |last1=Gollwitzer |first2=Paschal |last2=Sheeran |chapter=Implementation intentions and goal achievement |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Qhwr7jGyFsC&pg=PA70 |isbn=9780120152384 |date=2006-05-30}}</ref>  [[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionists]] are especially prone to having their [[Implementation intention|intention]]s backfire in this way.<ref>{{citation |title=Implementation Intentions, Perfectionism, and Goal Progress: Perhaps the Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=31 |pages=902&ndash;912 |year=2005 |doi=10.1177/0146167204272311 |pmid=15951362 |issue=7 |last1=Powers |first1=T.

One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the movement of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi and [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Triepshi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's influence in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim local civilians were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Triepshi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

{{IPA-sh|\u0261\u01d4si\u0272e|pron}}, {{lang-sq|Gucia}})  is a small [[town]] in north-eastern [[Montenegro]]. According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the movement of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi and [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood from Triepshi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood from Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's influence in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim local civilians were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.
