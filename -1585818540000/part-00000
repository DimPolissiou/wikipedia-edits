More specifically, scholastics like Thomas Aquinas and later Thomists (such as [[Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez]]) are often interpreted as holding that a human action can be free even though the agent in some strong sense could not do otherwise than he did. Whereas Aquinas is often interpreted to maintain rational compatibilism (i.e., an action can be determined by rational cognition and yet free), later Thomists such as B\u00e1\u00f1ez develop a sophisticated theory of theological determinism, according to which actions of free agents, despite being free, are, on a higher level, determined by infallible divine decrees manifested in the form of \"[[physical premotion]]\" (praemotio physica), a deterministic intervention of God into the will of a free agent required to reduce the will from potency to act. A strongly incompatibilist view of freedom was, on the other hand, developed in the Franciscan tradition, especially by [[Duns Scotus]], and later upheld and further developed by Jesuits, esp. [[Luis de Molina]] and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]].

As his directorial debut being a low budget film and crew are mostly new to the industry, he could not find the contacts to reach out to the big stars. However, the Vishal manages to get Shalini's email and sends her a short film of his script. She's impressed by his pilot gives an appointment to hear his story. They meet in a restaurant where Vishal narrates his story.\n\nThe scene now moves to a high school college principal Radha Krishna (Srikanth Ayangar) taking his only daughter Mitra ([[Nivetha Thomas]]) to school. There she meets Rahul ([[Sree Vishnu]]), Rambabu \"Rambo\" ([[Rahul Ramakrishna]]), and Rakesh \"Rocky\" ([[Priyadarshi Pulikonda]]) famous as 'R3' batch who are last benchers and failing their grades for several years. One day they fool around and try to steal their answer sheets and make a fool of themselves in the Chemistry class. Mitra is like them, in the aspect that she doesn't have an interest in studying. Instead, she likes classical dance and wants to be a national level dancer. Her parents divorced when she was young and she chose to live with her mother. After her mother passed away she had no other option left to live with her father. She takes a liking to the R3 gang and starts hanging out with them. Disappointed by her low grades, her father decides to enroll her in a Math tuition class which is run by her father's best friend. Having no rapport with her father, Mitra decides to run away from home to pursue her career. R3 batch supports her decision, and she devises a perfect plan for them to execute. Later her Math teacher takes advantage of her and harasses her sexually. She is sad and tells her father about it, but he dismisses it as pathetic excuse for skipping tuition. Mitra is heartbroken, her father is unable to help her and this makes her question her insecurity. She hatches a fake plan to get herself kidnapped by R3 and use the money to learn dance and run away from home. The R3 gang follow the plan perfectly and secure 10 lakh rupees from Mitra's father. Later Mitra runs away from home and moves to Hyderabad for living her dream.\n\nMeanwhile R3 gang bash the Math teacher on Mitra's behalf, and unknowingly injure an innocent person (later revealed as Vishal's dad). Meanwhile, Radha informs his cop friend Srinu (Harshavardhan) and asks him to investigate on R3. Srinu starts the investigation, but considers R3 as innocent. Mitra is excited to perform on stage and invites R3 to watch her performance. She forgets her phone while leaving for the dance studio. She is kidnapped again, this time by real thugs who are even willing to sell her for human trafficking. The thugs contact R3 for money as Mitra tells them that they are her only point of contact.The R3 batch is worried and decides to beg, borrow or steal money to save Mitra.\n\nVishal narrates half of the script to Shalini and promises to narrate the rest another day after making some minor developments. Later Shalini starts travelling with Vishal for the film, and falls for him. She introduces Vishal to some of the well known people in the film Industry and waits to propose to him for the marriage. Vishal receives a call from his mother, who tells him that his father was met with an accident. They need 10 lakh rupees for the surgery, and Shalini helps him out with the money. She gets the money from the bank by one of her agents, and drives Vishal to his father with the money. Meanwhile, Rocky sees this as an easy opportunity to get 10 lakh rupees for saving Mitra. They pelt a stone on Shalini's car in route, which leads to a car crash and steal the money. Rahul drops his phone which has the thug's contact on it at the crash scene (A mentally challenged person picks it up later). Vishal and Shalini are admitted to a local hospital and Vishal is hesitant to ask Shalini for more money for his father's surgery.\n\nMeanwhile, the thugs try to contact Rahul but to no avail. Then they decide to sell her and start moving to pick up point. Rahul and Vishal realize that the phone was dropped at the crash site, both race to the crash site and deduce that the mentally challenged must've picked up the phone and start hunting for him in the city. Meanwhile, one of the thugs gifts Mitra's bag to his daughter. R3 and thug's daughter end up in the same auto-rickshaw and they realize that it is Mitra's bag. They investigate his daughter for his whereabouts and track him down. Meanwhile, Vishal manages to track down the mentally challenged and chases after him. They all run into each other and on realizing it try to disperse. Then Rahul contacts kidnappers to save Mitra but the kidnappers refuse his deal and delete his contact. While transporting Mitra to their place, Mitra creates havoc in the car of thugs which leads to hit into a motorcycle and end up creating a huge ruckus. This leads to the police trying to document the issue for insurance purposes. They are surprised to discover Mitra and save her.\n\nMeanwhile, Vishal's sister informs Vishal that operation was completed successfully. He realizes that Shalini arranged the money again for his father, and He comes to thank her, then Shalini suddenly proposes him for marriage. Vishal is confused and Shalini promises to do his film even if he was not ready to accept her proposal. Vishal asks her for some time to think. Then they receive a parcel in the hospital which contains the 10 lakhs which was stolen by R3 initially.\n\nMeanwhile, Srinu makes Radha realise on the mistakes he made while disciplining his daughter. Then Radha decides to get Mitra back and wholeheartedly apologize her. Later in a police station Mitra contacts Rahul to pick her up. But Rahul refused to come instead to call her father because they have realised they had done a big mistake. Her father is the correct person to handle the situation for setting right and Rahul hopes all for good. Then Mitra calls her father and Radha receives her warmly in the station.\n\nThen finally the film ends with Radha supporting his daughter's decision by enrolling her in a classical dance academy and bashing his friend in front of his students along with Mitra.

As his directorial debut being a low budget film and crew are mostly new to the industry, he could not find the contacts to reach out to the big stars. However, the Vishal manages to get Shalini's email and sends her a short film of his script. She's impressed by his pilot gives an appointment to hear his story. They meet in a restaurant where Vishal narrates his story. \n\nThe scene now moves to a high school college principal Radha Krishna (Srikanth Ayangar) taking his only daughter Mitra ([[Nivetha Thomas]]) to school. There she meets Rahul ([[Sree Vishnu]]), Rambabu \"Rambo\" ([[Rahul Ramakrishna]]), and Rakesh \"Rocky\" ([[Priyadarshi Pulikonda]]) famous as 'R3' batch who are last benchers and failing their grades for several years. One day they fool around and try to steal their answer sheets and make a fool of themselves in the Chemistry class. Mitra is like them, in the aspect that she doesn't have an interest in studying. Instead, she likes classical dance and wants to be a national level dancer. Her parents divorced when she was young and she chose to live with her mother. After her mother passed away she had no other option left to live with her father. She takes a liking to the R3 gang and starts hanging out with them. Disappointed by her low grades, her father decides to enroll her in a Math tuition class which is run by her father's best friend. Having no rapport with her father, Mitra decides to run away from home to pursue her career. R3 batch supports her decision, and she devises a perfect plan for them to execute. Later her Math teacher takes advantage of her and harasses her sexually. She is sad and tells her father about it, but he dismisses it as pathetic excuse for skipping tuition. Mitra is heartbroken, her father is unable to help her and this makes her question her insecurity. She hatches a fake plan to get herself kidnapped by R3 and use the money to learn dance and run away from home. The R3 gang follow the plan perfectly and secure 10 lakh rupees from Mitra's father. Later Mitra runs away from home and moves to Hyderabad for living her dream.  \n\nMeanwhile R3 gang bash the Math teacher on Mitra's behalf, and unknowingly injure an innocent person (later revealed as Vishal's dad). Meanwhile Radha informs his cop friend Srinu (Harshavardhan) and asks him to investigate on R3. Srinu starts the investigation, but considers R3 as innocent. Mitra is excited to perform on stage and invites R3 to watch her performance. She forgets her phone while leaving for the dance studio. She is kidnapped again, this time by real thugs who are even willing to sell her for human trafficking. The thugs contact R3 for money as Mitra tells them that they are her only point of contact.The R3 batch is worried and decides to beg, borrow or steal money to save Mitra. \n\nVishal narrates half of the script to Shalini and promises to narrate the rest another day after making some minor developments. Later Shalini starts travelling with Vishal for the film, and falls for him. She introduces Vishal to some of the well known people in the film Industry and waits to propose to him for the marriage. Vishal receives a call from his mother, who tells him that his father was met with an accident. They need 10 lakh rupees for the surgery, and Shalini helps him out with the money. She gets the money from the bank by one of her agents, and drives Vishal to his father with the money. Meanwhile Rocky sees this as an easy opportunity to get 10 lakh rupees for saving Mitra. They pelt a stone on Shalini's car in route, which leads to a car crash and steal the money. Rahul drops his phone which has the thug's contact on it at the crash scene (A mentally challenged person picks it up later). Vishal and Shalini are admitted to a local hospital and Vishal is hesitant to ask Shalini for more money for his father's surgery.  \n\nMeanwhile the thugs try to contact Rahul but to no avail. Then they decide to sell her and start moving to pick up point. Rahul and Vishal realize that the phone was dropped at the crash site, both race to the crash site and deduce that the mentally challenged must've picked up the phone and start hunting for him in the city. Meanwhile one of the thugs gifts Mitra's bag to his daughter. R3 and thug's daughter end up in the same auto-rickshaw and they realize that it is Mitra's bag. They investigate his daughter for his whereabouts and track him down. Meanwhile Vishal manages to track down the mentally challenged and chases after him. They all run into each other and on realizing it try to disperse. Then Rahul contacts kidnappers to save Mitra but the kidnappers refuse his deal and delete his contact. While transporting Mitra to their place, Mitra creates havoc in the car of thugs which leads to hit into a motorcycle and end up creating a huge ruckus. This leads to the police trying to document the issue for insurance purposes. They are surprised to discover Mitra and save her. \n\nMeanwhile Vishal's sister informs Vishal that operation was completed successfully. He realizes that Shalini arranged the money again for his father, and He comes to thank her, then Shalini suddenly proposes him for marriage. Vishal is confused and Shalini promises to do his film even if he was not ready to accept her proposal. Vishal asks her for some time to think. Then they receive a parcel in the hospital which contains the 10 lakhs which was stolen by R3 initially. \n\nMeanwhile Srinu makes Radha realise on the mistakes he made while disciplining his daughter. Then Radha decides to get Mitra back and wholeheartedly apologize her. Later in a police station Mitra contacts Rahul to pick her up. But Rahul refused to come instead to call her father because they have realised they had done a big mistake. Her father is the correct person to handle the situation for setting right and Rahul hopes all for good. Then Mitra calls her father and Radha receives her warmly in the station. \n\nThen finally the film ends with Radha supporting his daughter's decision by enrolling her in a classical dance academy and bashing his friend in front of his students along with Mitra.
