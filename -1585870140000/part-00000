He was known for the highly experimental nature of his creative work.<ref name=\"nzepc.auckland\">Roger Horrocks, \u201cLeigh Davis,\u201d ''Ka mate ka ora: a new zealand journal of poetry and poetics'', no.9, 2010 (http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/kmko/)</ref>\n\n==Life==\nDavis was born in [[Raetihi]], completed an M.A. Honours degree in English at [[Auckland University]] (including a thesis on the poetry of [[Allen Curnow]]), then studied Commerce subjects towards an M.B.A. at [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]]. In 1980 he married Susan Unwin whom he had met as a fellow student and they had four children - Greer, Henry, India and Betty.\n\nDavis worked for several years as a Treasury analyst, then in 1985 joined the [[merchant bank]] of [[Michael Fay (banker)|Michael Fay]] and [[David Richwhite]]. He became a principal of their company in 1993, before forming his own venture, Jump Capital, a [[private equity fund]], in 1999. He was active as a [[patron of the arts]], becoming a Trustee of the Arts Foundation (2006\u201309) and sponsor of the [[Auckland]] art installation site Jar.\n\nIn 2008 Davis was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]]. He devoted the final year of his life to the completion of two large projects, ''Nameless'' and ''Stunning Debut of the Repairing of a Life''. The latter book records his successful struggle to regain the power of writing after the disruption caused by two brain operations and a course of [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]].\n\n==Career==\nDavis\u2019s literary career began with the book-length poetic sequence ''Willy\u2019s Gazette'' which won the Best New Zealand First Book of Poetry Award in 1983. It was described by Elizabeth Caffin in ''The Oxford History of New Zealand Literature'' in English as \u201ca rich, clever, and sophisticated exploration (in mock [[sonnet]] form) of the arbitrary and purely conventional nature of cultural signs.\u201d<ref>Elizabeth Caffin, \u201cPoetry,\u201d ''The Oxford History of New Zealand Literature in English''. ed. Terry Sturm, Second Edition, Auckland, OUP, 1998, p.481</ref>\n\nWith his friends Alex Calder and Roger Horrocks, Davis co-edited the magazine And which ran for four issues between 1983 and 1985. This provided a platform for some of New Zealand\u2019s most experimental prose and poetry writers, and also broke new ground in [[literary criticism]] by applying [[post-structuralist]] theory to local literature and art. The magazine \u201cmade a considerable impact on contemporary New Zealand literary studies\u201d according to Hugh Lauder, editor of ''Landfall''.<ref>Hugh Lauder, \u201cInterview \u2013 Debate with Leigh Davis,\u201d ''Landfall'' 155, September 1985, pp.310-19</ref>  And Mark Williams wrote in ''The Journal of New Zealand Literature'': \u201c''And'' went further towards initiating that long awaited renovation of local literary habits than any previous New Zealand little magazine since ''Freed'', and perhaps since ''Phoenix''.\u201d<ref>Mark Williams, \u201cOn the Margins?: New Zealand Little Magazines from ''Freed'' to ''And, The Journal of New Zealand Literature'', No.5, 1987, pp.86-87</ref>\n\nBetween 1985 and 1998 Davis directed most of his energies to his business career. Then in 1998 he returned to writing with ''Station of Earth-bound Ghosts''. This was the first of a series of large mixed-media projects in which he worked with artists from other fields (such as designers Stephen Canning and Christine Hansen). ''Station'' consisted of a series of texts in the form of flags which were hung the length of Auckland\u2019s Central Railway Station concourse. The work incorporated many elements in juxtaposition (in the manner of [[Ezra Pound]]\u2019s ''Cantos''), and was based primarily on the famous [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] historical figure [[Te Kooti]].\n\nThis was followed in 1999 by ''Te Tangi a te Matuhi'', a book in a box, which combined reproductions of the flags with work by Maori and [[Pakeha]] contributors, and a CD of related music. These flags began to be exhibited again in 2010 at Jar (589 New North Road, [[Kingsland, Auckland]]).\n\n''The Book of Hours'' (2001) was another book in a box (with visual elements by artist John Reynolds). This long poem by Davis was inspired by a yacht race and its patterns of movement.\n\n''General Motors'' (2001) was a sequence of poems that focused on a 16th-century painting by [[Il Garofalo|Garofalo]] ([[Benvenuto Tisi]]) of \u201c[[Saint Nicholas of Tolentino]] Reviving the Birds.\u201d [[Marjorie Perloff]] has written enthusiastically about the work\u2019s \u201cenigmatic layering of word and image.\u201d<ref>Marjorie Perloff, \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching By\u201d (http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/perloff/articles/davis.html)</ref> In collaboration with artist Stephen Bambury and others, ''General Motors'' was produced both as a limited-edition book and as an on-line, partly animated text on Davis\u2019s website jackbooks.com. The digital and physical versions each represented an experiment in re-thinking the genre of poetry and the medium of the book.\n\n''Anarchy'' (2006) was an \u201comnibus\u201d work, presented as a text/image exhibition at the Starkwhite Gallery in Auckland. Davis later expanded the project (with the help of Bambury and others) under the title of ''Nameless'' to include music, performance and installations. This is scheduled for publication in book form in 2011, together with the companion volume, ''Redux'', edited by Bambury, which will include a DVD realisation.\n\nDavis\u2019s final poetry book, ''Stunning Debut of the Repairing of a Life'', was published by [[Otago University Press]] in 2010 and won the Kathleen Grattan Poetry Award for that year.\n\nDavis also contributed shorter poems to magazines such as ''Parallax'', ''Splash'', and ''Brief Description of the Whole World''. His essays on art represent another large body of work which he planned to publish as a single collection under the title ''Art Knowledge''.\n\nIn 2009 the obituary in New Zealand\u2019s ''National Business Review'' described Davis as \u201can avant-gardist in both his creative and business careers,\u201d \u201ca complex and intriguing individual,\u201d and one of Auckland\u2019s \u201chighest achievers.\u201d<ref>\u201cLeigh Davis \u2013 avant garde in business, arts, adventure,\u201d ''National Business Review'', 9 October 2009</ref>\n\nHe was a controversial figure in the literary world during his lifetime, due both to the avant-garde nature of his writing and to his involvement in the business world which (according to [[Iain Sharp]]) \u201cinfuriated most of the literati who still expected artists and poets to register in public their unceasing opposition to [[Mammon]].\u201d<ref>Iain Sharp, \u201cNew Zealand,\u201d ''The Oxford Guide to Contemporary Writing'', ed. [[John Sturrock (writer)|John Sturrock]], Oxford, OUP, 1996, p.294</ref>  Davis\u2019s work tended to be received with greater interest among visual artists. In an obituary for the on-line literary magazine ''Ka Mate Ka Ora'', Roger Horrocks wrote: \u201cThe scope and experimental energy of Leigh\u2019s work make it unique in contemporary New Zealand poetry\u2026.The extent to which this highly original writer was ignored or marginalised during his lifetime is likely to amaze future readers.\u201d<ref name=\"nzepc.auckland\" />\n\n==Awards==\n:1983:  Best New Zealand First Book of Poetry Award\n:2010:  [[Kathleen Grattan Award]] for Poetry (posthumously)\n\n==Bibliography==\nEach year links to its corresponding \"[year] in poetry\" or \"[year] in literature\" article:\n*1983: ''Willy\u2019s Gazette'', Wellington, Jack Books\n*1999: ''Te Tangi a te Matuhi'', Auckland, Jack Books\n*1999: ''Willy\u2019s Gazette, Second Edition'', Auckland, Brief Description of the Whole World\n*2001: ''The Book of Hours'', Auckland, Jack Books\n*2001: ''General Motors'', Auckland, Jack Books\n*2010: ''Stunning Debut of the Repairing of a Life'', Dunedin, Otago University Press\n*2010: ''Nameless'', Auckland, Jack Books [in press]\n*2010: ''Redux'', ed.

{"title_page": "Chad Taylor (writer)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n'''Chad Taylor''' (born 1964) is a New Zealand writer.\n\n==Life==\nChad Taylor is a New Zealand author of novels, short stories and screenplays. He was born in [[Auckland]]. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Elam. He was the recipient of the [[Buddle Findlay Sargeson Fellowship]] for literature in 2001 and the [[University of Auckland]] Literary Fellow in 2003. His work has been translated in Germany, Italy and France. In 2006 he was one of 12 New Zealand authors invited to tour France for Les Belles Etrangeres.<ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10417170</ref> He appeared at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in 2012. He currently resides in New Zealand.\n\n==Work==\nTaylor's style can be described as [[neo-noir]]. His themes include murder and love, sex, reality, identity and life in an intense, urban environment. ''The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'' (1998) described him as:\n\n<blockquote>\nA writer of uncompromisingly contemporary fictions of transience and shifting realities in the modern city. Born and educated in Auckland, where his work is largely set, he graduated BFA at Elam and has carried that interest into the strong visual quality of his writing... The fictions often work on the edge of such conventions as the murder story ('No Sun, No Rain'), futuristic fantasy ('Somewhere in the 21st Century') or romance triangle (''Pack of Lies'', 'Calling Doctor Dollywell'), often through unreliable or unattractive narrators... As these literary norms are subverted, perceptions of reality and identity are challenged. Strong visual representations, especially of sex and clothing, and filmic treatment with fragmentary and mobile scenes and chronology, provide metaphorical access to these internal concerns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/profiles/taylor,%20chad |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209175428/http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/Writers/Profiles/Taylor,%20Chad |archive-date=9 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGuardian Critic [[Maxim Jakubowski]] described Taylor's novel ''Electric'' (2003) as \"entropy noir\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/25/featuresreviews.guardianreview19</ref> and praised ''Shirker'' (2000) for its \"existential anomie.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/25/crimebooks</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nMuch more ambitious, and weaving a seductive web of existential anomie, is Chad Taylor's ''Shirker'', a fascinating and obsessive novel from New Zealand with shades of Paul Auster's ''New York Trilogy''. Ellerslie Penrose, a part-time futures broker, finds a junkie's body in an Auckland dumpster, steals his wallet and embarks on a hallucinatory journey into the shadow life of the dead man. This brings him into contact with fantasy bordellos, mysterious manuscripts, bizarre antiques dealers, and a sleazy nest of quirky happenstance. Oddly detached from its subject matter, this is as hypnotic as they come; it's also miles away from the conventions of your average country-cottage crime or pig-headed cop yarn. One for the connoisseurs.\n</blockquote>\n\nTaylor acknowledged the \"noir\" label in a 2009 interview:<ref>http://primastoria.com/feature/conversation-with-chad-taylor</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nI\u2019ve basically deconstructed crime novels: I\u2019ve taken aspects of crime novels, rewritten them, taken them apart. People used to ask me, \u201cWhat do you write?\u201d... I just don\u2019t know. But you have come up with a word for what you do. \u2018Noir\u2019 kind of fits it.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1998, his novel ''Heaven'' was made into a feature film by [[Miramax]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120697/</ref> The film was produced by Sue Rogers, directed by Scott Reynolds and starred [[Martin Donovan]]. Taylor has also written for film including the original screenplay for the short film ''Funny Little Guy'' (1994), directed by Chris Graves.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0336259/</ref> In May 2003 the NZ Listener listed him as one of \"New Zealand's Top Ten Novelists Under 40.\"\n\n''Electric'' (2003) is set in Auckland during the power cuts that blacked out the city in 1998. ''Time Out London'' selected the novel as Book of the Week on 22 January 2003. ''Time Out'' critic Roger Howard described ''Electric'' as a story of chaos and urban malaise:\n\n<blockquote>\nHis setting is a New Zealand you won't see in ''Lord of the Ring''s: a city suffering from the same urban malaise as glitzier metropolises on other continents. Our protagonist, Samuel Usher, is a drug addict who supports himself by recovering data from damaged computers. He falls in with a couple of drifters who occupy themselves with recondite mathematics. But the favoured activity for all three involves powders on polished surfaces. When Jules dies in mysterious circumstances, Usher sets off to find out why. Thematically, Taylor's concerns are twofold: the infinite extent of digitised culture; and the limitless flood of narcotics (not to mention the global industry behind it). ''Electric'' looks at what happens when chaos rises up to warp these apparently unassailable worlds.<ref>http://chadtaylor.mobi/electric.html</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe novel ''Departure Lounge'' (2006) is based on the 1979 ''[[Erebus Aircraft Accident|Erebus crash]]''. ''Washington Post'' critic [[Jonathan Yardley]] compared the novel's style to Raymond Chandler:\n<blockquote>\nHis style owes a lot to Raymond Chandler and lesser apostles of noir, but at the same time it's very much his own. His prose is spare but with a strong undercurrent of emotion; \"cool\" certainly is the word for him, but there's a good deal of heat beneath.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050801612.html</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''Houston Chronicle'' critic P.G. Koch described ''Departure Lounge'' as a crime novel that played with expectations of the genre:\n\n<blockquote>\nNew Zealand writer Chad Taylor plays with the crime/noir genre for his own philosophical purposes in an open-ended way that subverts reassuring convention. In ''Departure Lounge'', we first glimpse a newscast tragedy \u2014 a plane that has vanished in Antarctica \u2014 before moving on to the book's narrator, Mark Chamberlain, as he shoots pool with Rory, a real estate developer who is short on scruples and whose apartment Mark later burgles... For all its nighttime street life of taxis and clubs, this is an oddly silent book. It is as if we move through its impeccable structure seeking resolution the same way that Mark ghosts through all those houses he breaks into. Taylor in effect has taken the not-knowing at the mystery genre's core and enshrined it, occupied its amorphous territory and made of it, as in this slight book's emotional peak, a luminous art.<ref>http://www.chron.com/life/books/article/New-in-mysteries-1883760.php</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 2008 UK ''Guardian'' critic [[Maxim Jakubowski]] described Chad Taylor as a cult author:\n<blockquote>\nTaylor is a minimalist whose tortured characters populate a world where silence and night form a disconsolate backdrop for their musings and meanderings across a landscape of bleak, concrete cities... (He has) a profound empathy for the losers in our midst and an acute sense of place and the bizarre in everyday life.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/09/creaturesfromadifferentboo</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nTaylor's 2009 novel ''The Church of John Coltrane'' (2009) was a sequel to ''Heaven''.<ref>http://chadtaylor.mobi/coltrane.html</ref>\n\nIn 2013 New Zealand director  [[Jonathan King (film director)|Jonathan King]] began filming Taylor's original screenplay ''REALITi''<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3084128/</ref> in Wellington, New Zealand. The film is a science fiction / noir set in the near future. Taylor has described it as a \"talkie\" and \"a science fiction film with no special effects.\"<ref>http://chadtaylormarginalia.blogspot.com/2013/01/watch-this-space.html\n</ref> The cast of ''REALITi'' includes Nathan Meister, [[Michelle Langstone]], Miranda Manasiadis, [[Graham McTavish]] , Tim Wong and Aroha White. The film premiered at the New Zealand International Film Festival and at [[Fantastic Fest]]. [[Harry Knowles]] reviewed the movie at [[Ain't It Cool News]]:\n<blockquote>This is a deliberately paced mind bender ... A societal science fiction horror film. Now, it isn\u2019t horror in the bogeyman sense, it\u2019s horror because the idea of chemicals that can reprogram your perception of reality toward a corporate or governmental agenda is not only terrifying, but ingested intelligence is something that some scientists and tech watchers are predicting as being something that will be in our world in very short order. We\u2019ve heard that the powers that be have figured out how to suppress and alter memories and this film plays with that disconcerting reality. Nathan Meister does a great job of being off center throughout the film. He\u2019s having colliding realities that are not discernable to his senses, but he\u2019s feeling things are slipping. He\u2019s trying to understand what happened to him, and navigating this bad trip is... well, the fun of this film.

He was born in [[Auckland]]. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Elam. He was the recipient of the [[Buddle Findlay Sargeson Fellowship]] for literature in 2001 and the [[University of Auckland]] Literary Fellow in 2003. His work has been translated in Germany, Italy and France. In 2006 he was one of 12 New Zealand authors invited to tour France for Les Belles Etrangeres.<ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10417170</ref> He appeared at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in 2012. He currently resides in New Zealand.\n\n==Work==\nTaylor's style can be described as [[neo-noir]]. His themes include murder and love, sex, reality, identity and life in an intense, urban environment. ''The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'' (1998) described him as:\n\n<blockquote>\nA writer of uncompromisingly contemporary fictions of transience and shifting realities in the modern city. Born and educated in Auckland, where his work is largely set, he graduated BFA at Elam and has carried that interest into the strong visual quality of his writing... The fictions often work on the edge of such conventions as the murder story ('No Sun, No Rain'), futuristic fantasy ('Somewhere in the 21st Century') or romance triangle (''Pack of Lies'', 'Calling Doctor Dollywell'), often through unreliable or unattractive narrators... As these literary norms are subverted, perceptions of reality and identity are challenged. Strong visual representations, especially of sex and clothing, and filmic treatment with fragmentary and mobile scenes and chronology, provide metaphorical access to these internal concerns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/profiles/taylor,%20chad |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209175428/http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/Writers/Profiles/Taylor,%20Chad |archive-date=9 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nGuardian Critic [[Maxim Jakubowski]] described Taylor's novel ''Electric'' (2003) as \"entropy noir\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/25/featuresreviews.guardianreview19</ref> and praised ''Shirker'' (2000) for its \"existential anomie.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/25/crimebooks</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nMuch more ambitious, and weaving a seductive web of existential anomie, is Chad Taylor's ''Shirker'', a fascinating and obsessive novel from New Zealand with shades of Paul Auster's ''New York Trilogy''. Ellerslie Penrose, a part-time futures broker, finds a junkie's body in an Auckland dumpster, steals his wallet and embarks on a hallucinatory journey into the shadow life of the dead man. This brings him into contact with fantasy bordellos, mysterious manuscripts, bizarre antiques dealers, and a sleazy nest of quirky happenstance. Oddly detached from its subject matter, this is as hypnotic as they come; it's also miles away from the conventions of your average country-cottage crime or pig-headed cop yarn. One for the connoisseurs.\n</blockquote>\n\nTaylor acknowledged the \"noir\" label in a 2009 interview:<ref>http://primastoria.com/feature/conversation-with-chad-taylor</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nI\u2019ve basically deconstructed crime novels: I\u2019ve taken aspects of crime novels, rewritten them, taken them apart. People used to ask me, \u201cWhat do you write?\u201d... I just don\u2019t know. But you have come up with a word for what you do. \u2018Noir\u2019 kind of fits it.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1998, his novel ''Heaven'' was made into a feature film by [[Miramax]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120697/</ref> The film was produced by Sue Rogers, directed by Scott Reynolds and starred [[Martin Donovan]]. Taylor has also written for film including the original screenplay for the short film ''Funny Little Guy'' (1994), directed by Chris Graves.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0336259/</ref> In May 2003 the NZ Listener listed him as one of \"New Zealand's Top Ten Novelists Under 40.\"\n\n''Electric'' (2003) is set in Auckland during the power cuts that blacked out the city in 1998. ''Time Out London'' selected the novel as Book of the Week on 22 January 2003. ''Time Out'' critic Roger Howard described ''Electric'' as a story of chaos and urban malaise:\n\n<blockquote>\nHis setting is a New Zealand you won't see in ''Lord of the Ring''s: a city suffering from the same urban malaise as glitzier metropolises on other continents. Our protagonist, Samuel Usher, is a drug addict who supports himself by recovering data from damaged computers. He falls in with a couple of drifters who occupy themselves with recondite mathematics. But the favoured activity for all three involves powders on polished surfaces. When Jules dies in mysterious circumstances, Usher sets off to find out why. Thematically, Taylor's concerns are twofold: the infinite extent of digitised culture; and the limitless flood of narcotics (not to mention the global industry behind it). ''Electric'' looks at what happens when chaos rises up to warp these apparently unassailable worlds.<ref>http://chadtaylor.mobi/electric.html</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe novel ''Departure Lounge'' (2006) is based on the 1979 ''[[Erebus Aircraft Accident|Erebus crash]]''.
