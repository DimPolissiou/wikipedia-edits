Margaux, who was an actress and model, died of a [[phenobarbital|barbiturate]] overdose at age 42 in 1996.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were [[Hadley Richardson]] (1891\u20131979) and [[Nobel Prize]]\u2013laureate novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899\u20131961), who committed suicide four months before she was born.

She received notice for her acting and was nominated as \"Best Newcomer\" for the [[Golden Globe Award]] that year. Her highest profile role came with her role in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979), a [[romantic comedy]] in which she plays Tracy, a high school student and Allen's lover.

The main difficulty is in [[saccade]] initiation, but there is also impaired cancellation of the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]]. Patients have to turn their head in order to compensate for the lack of eye movement initiation in order to follow an object or see objects in their [[peripheral vision]], but they often exceed their target. There is controversy regarding whether OMA should be considered an [[apraxia]], since apraxia is the inability to perform a learned or skilled motor action to command, and saccade initiation is neither a learned nor a skilled action.<ref name=Galvaez>Galvaez-Jimenez N, Tuite P, Bhatia K, editors.

Some common delays are seen in speech, reading and motor development<ref name=Galvaez />\n\n== Causes ==\n\nOMA is a neurological condition. Although some brain imaging studies of people with OMA reveal a normal brain, some MRI studies have revealed unusual appearance of some brain areas, in particular the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and/or fourth ventricle. Oculomotor apraxia can be acquired or [[congenital]]. Sometimes no cause is found, in which case it is described as [[idiopathic]]<ref name=Tada />\n\nA person may be born with the parts of the brain for eye movement control not working, or may manifest poor eye movement control in childhood. If any part of the brain that controls eye movement becomes damaged, then OMA may develop.<ref name=Le_Ber />  One of the potential causes is bifrontal hemorrhages. In this case, OMA is associated with bilateral lesions of the [[frontal eye fields]] (FEF), located in the caudal middle frontal gyrus. The FEF control voluntary eye movements, including saccades, smooth pursuit and vergence. OMA can also be associated with bilateral hemorrhages in the parietal eye fields (PEF). The PEF surround the posterior, medial segment of the intraparietal sulcus. They have a role in reflexive saccades, and send information to the FEF. Since the FEF and PEF have complementary roles in voluntary and reflexive production of saccades, respectively, and they get inputs from different areas of the brain, only bilateral lesions to both the FEF and PEF will cause persistent OMA.  Patients with either bilateral FEF or bilateral PEF damage (but not both FEF and PEF) have been shown to regain at least some voluntary saccadic initiation some time after their hemorrhages. Other causes of OMA include brain tumors and cardiovascular problems,.<ref>Chen, J, Thurtell, M. Acquired ocular motor apraxia due to bifrontal haemorrhages.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar & Rinehart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> After two years of leasing them to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), Hearst sold her the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' in 1939; she merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/devil-and-mr-hearst/|title=The Devil and Mr. Hearst|last=Frank|first=Dana|date=June 22, 2000|website=The Nation}}</ref>, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', the sale of the ''[[Omaha Daily Bee]]'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon to fit television schedules and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. \n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]'' to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''. After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' \u2013 merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American'' one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html|title=The Press: Quiet Deal|date=1959-08-31|work=Time|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''. In turn, the ''Examiner'' became an evening publication, absorbing the ''[[The San Francisco Call|News-Call-Bulletin]]''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'' to form the ''New York World Journal Tribune'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.\n\nThe 1962 merger of the ''Herald-Express'' and ''Examiner'' in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company's demise, with the ''Herald Examiner'' ceasing publication November 2, 1989.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Last Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Strike| url=https://library.csun.edu/SCA/Peek-in-the-Stacks/Examiner| date=February 3, 2014| website=[[California State University Northridge]] [[Oviatt Library]]| accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper shifts===\nHearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring [[Arbor House]] in 1978 and [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/arts/donald-fine-75-publisher-of-suspenseful-best-sellers.html|title=Donald Fine, 75, Publisher Of Suspenseful Best Sellers|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=1997-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Hearst acquires leading book publisher| agency=United Press International| accessdate=28 August 2018| url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/13/Hearst-acquires-leading-book-publisher/5505350888400/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the company sold the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Herald American]]'' \u2014the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's ''Record-American & Advertiser'' with the ''Herald-Traveler'' \u2014 to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/18/Murdoch-Hearst-agree-on-sale-of-Boston-Herald-American/3484406443600/|title=Murdoch, Hearst agree on sale of Boston Herald American|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> which renamed the paper as ''[[The Boston Herald]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/us/boston-newspaper-renamed.html|title=Boston Newspaper Renamed|last=Ap|date=1982-12-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> competing to this day with the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hearst bought the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and that same year closed the 213-year-old ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'' after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell|A.S.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar & Rinehart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> After two years of leasing them to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), Hearst sold her the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' in 1939; she merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/devil-and-mr-hearst/|title=The Devil and Mr. Hearst|last=Frank|first=Dana|date=June 22, 2000|website=The Nation}}</ref>, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', the sale of the ''[[Omaha Daily Bee]]'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon to fit television schedules and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. \n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]'' to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''. After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' \u2013 merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American'' one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html|title=The Press: Quiet Deal|date=1959-08-31|work=Time|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''. In turn, the ''Examiner'' became an evening publication, absorbing the ''[[The San Francisco Call|News-Call-Bulletin]]''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'' to form the ''New York World Journal Tribune'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.\n\nThe 1962 merger of the ''Herald-Express'' and ''Examiner'' in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company's demise, with the ''Herald Examiner'' ceasing publication November 2, 1989.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Last Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Strike| url=https://library.csun.edu/SCA/Peek-in-the-Stacks/Examiner| date=February 3, 2014| website=[[California State University Northridge]] [[Oviatt Library]]| accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper shifts===\nHearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring [[Arbor House]] in 1978 and [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/arts/donald-fine-75-publisher-of-suspenseful-best-sellers.html|title=Donald Fine, 75, Publisher Of Suspenseful Best Sellers|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=1997-08-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Hearst acquires leading book publisher| agency=United Press International| accessdate=28 August 2018| url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/13/Hearst-acquires-leading-book-publisher/5505350888400/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the company sold the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Herald American]]'' \u2014the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's ''Record-American & Advertiser'' with the ''Herald-Traveler'' \u2014 to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/18/Murdoch-Hearst-agree-on-sale-of-Boston-Herald-American/3484406443600/|title=Murdoch, Hearst agree on sale of Boston Herald American|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> which renamed the paper as ''[[The Boston Herald]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/us/boston-newspaper-renamed.html|title=Boston Newspaper Renamed|last=Ap|date=1982-12-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> competing to this day with the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hearst bought the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and that same year closed the 213-year-old ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'' after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell|A.S.

The festival was originally called Big Valley Jamboree and was first established by Father [[Lucien Larr\u00e9]], as a fundraiser for his Bosco Homes for emotionally disturbed youth.    \n\nIn the early 1990s the Vinet family of Alberta took over management of the event, and in 1992 they expanded the event into Camrose, Alberta, to host two country festivals.   \n\n  [[File:Big Valley Jamboree Backstage Pass.jpg|thumb|Backstage pass for the Craven and Camrose events. ]]  \n\nA successor event, the Kinsmen Rock'N the Valley rock music festival, ran until 2004.

King [[Mindaugas]] was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic [[King of Lithuania]] in 1253. The expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the [[Grand Duke]] [[Gediminas]] (reigned 1316\u20131341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the [[Black Sea]]. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the [[Hanseatic league]], offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and [[knights]] to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]] (1297\u20131382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).\n\nIn 1569 the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed through the union of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel \u2013 [[vytin\u0117]], used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania.\n \nThe Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called [[Constitution of 3 May]], declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[Szlachta]], were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.{{by whom|date=January 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of [[capitalism]].\n\n===Lithuania in the 20th century===\n\n[[File:The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933 -1939.jpg|thumb|left|310px|The [[Bank of Lithuania]] building in [[Kaunas]], 1933\u20131939]]\n\nOn 16 February 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania.

King [[Mindaugas]] was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic [[King of Lithuania]] in 1253. The expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the [[Grand Duke]] [[Gediminas]] (reigned 1316\u20131341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the [[Black Sea]]. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the [[Hanseatic league]], offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and [[knights]] to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]] (1297\u20131382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).\n\nIn 1569 the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed through the union of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel \u2013 [[vytin\u0117]], used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania.\n \nThe Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called [[Constitution of 3 May]], declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[Szlachta]], were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.{{by whom|date=January 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of [[capitalism]].\n\n===Lithuania in the 20th century===\n\n[[File:The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933 -1939.jpg|thumb|left|310px|The [[Bank of Lithuania]] building in [[Kaunas]], 1933\u20131939]]\n\nOn 16 February 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania.

The oldest school here is senior secondary co-ed school, built by the late Seth Shri Dedraj Khaitan. Now there are about 50 schools and colleges in Losal. Total resident population of Losal is about 30,000 in addition to more than 15,000 students studying in local institutions.\n\nShri Dedraj Khaitan was the brother of Shri Mukha Lal Khaitan, one of the biggest jute traders of Calcutta in pre-independence era. Sri Mukha Lal Khaitan and Shri Dedraj Khaitan then established Losal's first School called Sri Ded Raj Khaitan School and its first Hospital, now both run by State Government of Rajasthan. Smt. Gulab Devi Khaitan, wife of Shri Dedraj khaitan also laid the foundation stone of first and only library in Losal to promote education in the town. They also constructed the first Girls hostel in Sikar today known as Krishna Chatrawaas for Dalit girls. Smt. Gulab Devi Khaitan was the sister of Seth Sri [[Jamnalal Bajaj]], noted industrialist, philanthropist, freedom fighter and a very close associate of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Haripura is a small village under Losal municipal corporation, is native palace of Kargil sahid Syodana Ram Bijarniya. \nThe town is witnessing accelerated growth recently with the development of several educational institutions, real estate projects and town development activities. Many of these projects are being developed by an infrastructure development company which is part of the business group of Shri Hargovind Khaitan, the only son of late Shri Dedraj Khaitan. The company is working to transform people's lives in rural and semi urban areas by providing better amenities, infrastructure and access to opportunities. The main objectives of these initiatives are:\n# Provide dwelling units to all the village citizens with clean water supply and sanitation facilities, \n# Apart from upgrading existing schools, establishment of few colleges, world class vocational training institutions in construction, carpentry, welding, natural art; computer maintenance and services, IT Enabled Services, BPO and a Call Center, \n# Enable people in the town to get quality healthcare through tele-medicine and also through mobile clinics,\n4)\tPromotion of horticulture products, apart from agriculture in collaboration with nearby agricultural universities and research institutions, \n5)\tPromotion of agro-processing industries for value addition to horticulture produce,\n6)\tCreation of dairy farms for providing additional non-farm revenue to farmers, \n7)\tProvision of employment to all employable people of the village through additional jobs in dairy, agro-processing, construction, handicraft and tourism enterprises.\n8) Losal not a village but it is city\n\nLosal is a Municipality city in the Sikar district, Rajasthan.

Once they are ionized, they are trapped transversely by the electron beam. Since the trapped ions stay on the electron beam and kick electrons out of orbit, the results of this ion trapping are harmful for the performance of electron storage rings.

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land; Indians were not usually permitted to do so. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed from Iowa in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].\n\n===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860===\n\n{{Main|Michigan Territory|Wisconsin Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Iowa Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Iowa [[Seal of Iowa#Iowa territorial seal|Territorial Seal]]]]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]] who settled along the western banks of the [[Mississippi River]], founding the modern day cities of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]].<ref name=Settlers/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://co.jackson.ia.us/history.htm|title=Jackson County, Iowa History Information|publisher=Jackson County, Iowa|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref> On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].

On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>\"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa\", Marcus L.

The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985===\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly.

By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name=\"iaarch\" />\n\nThe arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name=\"iaarch\">Alex, Lynn M.

Trade continued in furs and lead, but disease and forced population movement decimated Indian cultures and economies. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] that surrendered much of [[Illinois]] to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Indians from Iowa.\n\nThe Sauk and Meskwaki were pushed out of the Mississippi valley in 1832, out of the [[Iowa River]] valley in 1843, and out of Iowa altogether in 1846. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the [[Meskwaki Settlement]] remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land; Indians were not usually permitted to do so. The [[Ho-Chunk]] were removed from Iowa in 1850, and the [[Sioux|Dakota]] were removed by the late 1850s. Western Iowa around modern [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]] was used as a way station for other tribes being moved west, including the [[Potawatomi]].\n\n===U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860===\n\n{{Main|Michigan Territory|Wisconsin Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Iowa Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Iowa territorial seal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Iowa [[Seal of Iowa#Iowa territorial seal|Territorial Seal]]]]\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.<ref name=Settlers>{{cite web|url=http://publications.iowa.gov/135/1/history/7-1.html|title=History of Iowa|publisher=Iowa State University|author=Schwieder, Dorothy|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> Primarily, they were families from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]] who settled along the western banks of the [[Mississippi River]], founding the modern day cities of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Bellevue, Iowa|Bellevue]].<ref name=Settlers/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://co.jackson.ia.us/history.htm|title=Jackson County, Iowa History Information|publisher=Jackson County, Iowa|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref> On July 4, 1838, the [[U.S. Congress]] established the [[Territory of Iowa]].

On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>\"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa\", Marcus L.

The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]].

The introduction of railroads in the 1850s and 1860s transformed Iowa into a major agricultural producer.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first farm-related industries developed in the 1870s, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985===\n\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly.
