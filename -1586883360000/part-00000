Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u09ae}} ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09ae}} ''gram'' (CCVC) \"village\" or {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09c1\u09b2}} ''iskul'' (VC.CVC) for {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09c1\u09b2}} ''skul'' (CCVC) \"school\".\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Bengali alphabet|Bengali Braille}}\n[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|An example of handwritten Bengali.

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]].

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/>\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\"/> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.

Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09b9\u09af\u09cb\u0997\u09bf\u09a4\u09be}} '''''sh\u00f4'''-h\u00f4-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' \"cooperation\", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n===Consonant clusters===\n{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side).

However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]].

The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a4}} {{IPA|[m'''\u0254'''t]}} \"opinion\" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} \"mind\", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4]]'' {{lang|bn|(\u09cd)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cd}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|\u09a8}} in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09a8}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} in {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09be\u09ae\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u0261amla]}}).\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09bf}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| \u09bf}} (called {{lang|bn|\u0987-\u0995\u09be\u09b0}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c1}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c2}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c3}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c7}} {{IPA|[me~m\u025b]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09c8}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cb}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09cc}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel {{IPA|[\u0254]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|\u09ae}} {{IPA|[m\u0254]}}.\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u0987}} {{IPA|[moj]}} \"ladder\" and in {{lang|bn|\u0987\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6}} {{IPA|[ili\u0283]}} \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|\u0987}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| \u09bf)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''h\u00f4s\u00f4nt\u00f4'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''ch\u00f4ndr\u00f4bindu'' {{lang|bn|(\u0981)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|\u099a\u09be\u0981\u09a6}} {{IPA|[t\u0283\u00e3d]}} \"moon\"), the postposed ''\u00f4nusbar'' {{lang|bn|(\u0982)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be}} {{IPA|[ba\u014bla]}} \"Bengali\") and the postposed ''bis\u00f4rg\u00f4'' {{lang|bn|(\u0983)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0989\u0983!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} \"ouch!\") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c1\u0983\u0996}} {{IPA|[duk\u02b0\u02d0\u0254]}} \"sorrow\").\n\nThe [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u099e\u09cd\u099c\u09a8}} ''jukt\u00f4b\u00eanj\u00f4n'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|\u0964}} ''da\u1e5bi'' \u2013 the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] \u2013 have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/>\n\nUnlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|\u09a4}} ''t\u00f4'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|\u09e9}} \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0}} ''tr\u00f4'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|\u098f}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n===Orthographic depth===\nThe Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\"/> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|\u09b6}}, {{lang|bn|\u09b7}}, and {{lang|bn|\u09b8}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|\u09b8}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u0996\u09b2\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sk\u02b0\u0254lon]}} \"fall\", {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09a8}} {{IPA|[sp\u0254ndon]}} \"beat\", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[\u0282]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09b7\u09cd\u099f}} {{IPA|[k\u0254\u0282\u0288\u0254]}} \"suffering\", {{lang|bn|\u0997\u09cb\u09b7\u09cd\u09a0\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u0261o\u0282\u0288\u02b0i]}} \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|\u099c}} and {{lang|bn|\u09af}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|\u09a3}} {{IPA|[\u0273]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|\u099f}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a0}}, {{lang|bn|\u09a1}} and {{lang|bn|\u09a2}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09a4}} {{IPA|[\u025bto]}} \"so much\", {{lang|bn|\u098f\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a1\u09c7\u09ae\u09c0}} {{IPA|[\u025bkademi]}} \"academy\", {{lang|bn|\u0985\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ac\u09be}} {{IPA|[\u025bmiba]}} \"amoeba\", {{lang|bn|\u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09be}} {{IPA|[d\u025bk\u02b0a]}} \"to see\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4}} {{IPA|[b\u025bsto]}} \"busy\", {{lang|bn|\u09ac\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09b0\u09a3}} {{IPA|[b\u025bkor\u0254n]}} \"grammar\".\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[\u0254]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0\u09b8\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09a4\u09bf}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09ae}} {{IPA|[k\u0254m]}} \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|\u09b7}} {{IPA|[\u0282]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u09b0\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09b7}} {{IPA|[rukk\u02b0o]}} \"coarse\") or {{IPA|[kk\u02b0o]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09a4\u09bf}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0oti]}} \"harm\") or even {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254]}} (as in {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae\u09a4\u09be}} {{IPA|[kk\u02b0\u0254mota]}} \"capability\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n===Uses===\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.\n\n===Romanisation===\n{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}\n\nThere are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name=IAST1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212100431/http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit/sanskrit3.html\n | archivedate=12 February 2007\n | title=Learning International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration\n | work=Sanskrit 3 \u2013 Learning transliteration\n | publisher=Gabriel Pradiipaka & Andr\u00e9s Muni | accessdate=20 November 2006\n}}</ref> \"Indian languages Transliteration\" or [[ITRANS]] (uses upper case letters suited for [[ASCII]] keyboards),<ref name=ITRANS1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | title=ITRANS&nbsp;\u2013 Indian Language Transliteration Package\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | publisher=Avinash Chopde\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123020111/http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/\n | archive-date=23 January 2013\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref> and the [[National Library at Kolkata romanisation]].<ref name=NatLib>{{cite web\n | url=http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | title=Annex-F: Roman Script Transliteration\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | date=1 April 1999\n | work=Indian Standard: Indian Script Code for Information Interchange&nbsp;\u2013 ISCII\n | publisher=[[Bureau of Indian Standards]]\n | page=32\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716225648/http://varamozhi.sourceforge.net/iscii91.pdf\n | archive-date=16 July 2012\n | url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Bengali grammar}}\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n===Word order===\nAs a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name=\"tb16\">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name=UCLA1>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | title=Bengali\n | accessdate=20 November 2006\n | work=UCLA Language Materials project\n | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715213818/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=84&menu=004\n | archive-date=15 July 2007\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nYes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|\u0995\u09bf}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|\u09a8\u09be}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name=\"tb\"/> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-\u0997\u09c1\u09b2\u09cb}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].\n\nIn most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided in to 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in term of usages, cases are generally grouped in to only 4 categories.\n\n{| style=\"align:center; width:60%; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Singular noun inflection\n!\n!

Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-\u099f\u09be}} ''-\u1e6da'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-\u099c\u09a8}} ''-j\u00f4n'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=141\u2013142}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+ Measure words\n|-\n!

However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|\u09b6\u09c1\u09a7\u09c1 \u098f\u0995'''\u099c\u09a8''' \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964}} ''Shudhu \u00eak-'''j\u00f4n''' thakbe.''

Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name=\"huq_sarkar\">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is {{lang|bn|\u09b8\u09c7 \u09b6\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u0995}} ''se shikkh\u00f4k'', (literally \"he teacher\").<ref name=\"hacce-bangali\">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkh\u00f4k hocche''.

The Pretoria government tendered the project, winning the concession for a private railway company in 1870, promising areas of 850 farms as payment guarantee. The construction project had to be postponed because the licensed company was unable to obtain the capital initially required. After several years of preparation, the government decided to take control of the construction in 1876. The Portuguese engineer and officer Joaquim Jos\u00e9 Machado carried out a new survey of land in 1881 and 1882 to find an ideal route, as some gold fields on both sides of the [[Crocodile River (Mpumalanga)|Crocodile River]] should have easy access to a rail connection.<ref name=\"Goldfelder\">Anonymus, [H. Haevernick]: ''Die Goldfelder von Transvaal. Begleitworte zur Karte''. In: Dr. A. Petermanns Mitteilungen, 31. Bd., [[Justus Perthes]], Gotha 1885, S. 89</ref>\n\nIn 1872, the colonial administration of Mozambique granted, for the first time, a concession to build a railway line from Maputo to Pretoria. A corresponding agreement was concluded in 1875 between the government of the Republic of Transvaal and that of Portuguese East Africa. However, it was only on March 1, 1890, that the route from Maputo to the Mozambican border station [[Ressano Garcia]] was opened.<ref name=\"R\u00f6ll-1912\">[http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Portugiesisch-Ostafrika%3A+Mosambik Portugiesisch-Ostafrika: Mosambik].

These terrain characteristics also delayed the construction of an efficient road. In addition, in the 1880s, a financing contract worth half a million pounds on the [[Amsterdam]] [[Euronext Amsterdam|capital market]] was eventually lost. Construction began on June 2, 1887 and was completed after seven years on October 20, 1894, so that the entire route was opened to traffic on November 2, 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/seven-year-long-construction-delagoa-bay-railway-line-starts%C2%A0%C2%A0|work=South African History Online|accessdate=2014-06-24|title=The seven-year long construction of Delagoa Bay railway line starts.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230104507/http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/seven-year-long-construction-delagoa-bay-railway-line-starts%C2%A0%C2%A0|archivedate=2013-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/building-delagoa-bay-railway-line-completed%C2%A0-it-be-opened-traffic-2-november-1894|work=South African History Online|accessdate=2014-06-24|title=Building of the Delagoa Bay railway line is completed.

The Pretoria government tendered the project, winning the concession for a private railway company in 1870, promising areas of 850 farms as payment guarantee. The construction project had to be postponed because the licensed company was unable to obtain the capital initially required. After several years of preparation, the government decided to take control of the construction in 1876. The Portuguese engineer and officer Joaquim Jos\u00e9 Machado carried out a new survey of land in 1881 and 1882 to find an ideal route, as some gold fields on both sides of the [[Crocodile River (Mpumalanga)|Crocodile River]] should have easy access to a rail connection.<ref name=\"Goldfelder\">Anonymus, [H. Haevernick]: ''Die Goldfelder von Transvaal. Begleitworte zur Karte''. In: Dr. A. Petermanns Mitteilungen, 31. Bd., [[Justus Perthes]], Gotha 1885, S. 89</ref>\n\nIn 1872, the colonial administration of Mozambique granted, for the first time, a concession to build a railway line from Maputo to Pretoria. A corresponding agreement was concluded in 1875 between the government of the Republic of Transvaal and that of Portuguese East Africa. However, it was only on March 1, 1890, that the route from Maputo to the Mozambican border station [[Ressano Garcia]] was opened.<ref name=\"R\u00f6ll-1912\">[http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Portugiesisch-Ostafrika%3A+Mosambik Portugiesisch-Ostafrika: Mosambik].

These terrain characteristics also delayed the construction of an efficient road. In addition, in the 1880s, a financing contract worth half a million pounds on the [[Amsterdam]] [[Euronext Amsterdam|capital market]] was eventually lost. Construction began on June 2, 1887 and was completed after seven years on October 20, 1894, so that the entire route was opened to traffic on November 2, 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/seven-year-long-construction-delagoa-bay-railway-line-starts%C2%A0%C2%A0|work=South African History Online|accessdate=2014-06-24|title=The seven-year long construction of Delagoa Bay railway line starts.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230104507/http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/seven-year-long-construction-delagoa-bay-railway-line-starts%C2%A0%C2%A0|archivedate=2013-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/building-delagoa-bay-railway-line-completed%C2%A0-it-be-opened-traffic-2-november-1894|work=South African History Online|accessdate=2014-06-24|title=Building of the Delagoa Bay railway line is completed.

(The other three are [[Middle Temple]], [[Inner Temple]] and [[Gray's Inn]].) Lincoln's Inn is recognised as being one of the world's most prestigious professional bodies of judges and lawyers.\n\nLincoln's Inn is situated in [[Holborn]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], just on the border with the [[City of London]] and the [[City of Westminster]], and across the road from [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], [[Royal Courts of Justice]] and [[King's College London]]'s [[Maughan Library]]. The nearest tube station is [[Holborn tube station]] or [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]].\n\nLincoln's Inn is the largest Inn, covering {{convert|11|acre|ha|abbr=off}}. It is believed to be named after [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the 12th and early 13th centuries, the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. Then two events happened which ended this form of legal education: firstly, a [[papal bull]] in 1218 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the [[common law]], rather than [[canon law]];<ref>Bellot (1902) p. 32</ref> and secondly, a decree by [[Henry III of England]] on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London.<ref>Douthwaite (1886) p.2</ref> The secular lawyers migrated to the hamlet of [[Holborn]], near to the law courts at [[Westminster Hall]] and outside the City.<ref name=\"counselmagazine1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.counselmagazine.co.uk/articles/uncommon-counsel-2-barts-butchers-and-barristers|title=Uncommon counsel (2): Barts, butchers and barristers|publisher=Counsel|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles & Holborn Civil Parish Map 1870.png|thumb|250px|left|A map showing the boundaries of the Inn in 1870]]\n\nAs with the other Inns of Court, the precise date of founding of Lincoln's Inn is unknown. The Inn can claim the oldest records \u2013 its \"black books\" documenting the minutes of the governing council go back to 1422, and the earliest entries show that the inn was at that point an organised and disciplined body.<ref>Barton (1928) p.7</ref> The [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|third Earl of Lincoln]] had encouraged lawyers to move to Holborn, and they moved to [[Thavie's Inn]], one of the [[Inns of Chancery]], later expanding into [[Furnival's Inn]] as well.<ref>Barton (1928) p.256</ref> It is felt that Lincoln's Inn became a formally organised inn of court soon after the earl's death in 1310.<ref>Spilsbury (1850) p.32</ref>\n\nAt some point before 1422, the greater part of \"Lincoln's Inn\", as they had become known, after the Earl, moved to the estate of [[Ralph Neville]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], near [[Chancery Lane]]. They retained Thavie's and Furnival's Inn, using them as \"training houses\" for young lawyers, and fully purchased the properties in 1550 and 1547 respectively.<ref>Barton (1928) p.257</ref> In 1537, the land Lincoln's Inn sat on was sold by Bishop [[Richard Sampson]] to a [[Bencher]] named William Suliard, and his son sold the land to Lincoln's Inn in 1580.<ref>Barton (1928) p.258</ref> The Inn became formally organised as a place of legal education thanks to a decree in 1464, which required a [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Reader]] to give  lectures to the law students there.<ref>Ringrose (1909) p.81</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, the Inn was not a particularly prosperous one, and the Benchers, particularly [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], are credited with fixing this situation.<ref>Pulling (1884) p.142</ref>\n\n==Structure and governance==\n[[File:New Hall of Lincoln's Inn, London by Henry Fox Talbot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|New Hall of Lincoln's Inn, London, by [[Henry Fox Talbot]], circa 1841/46]]\nLincoln's Inn had no constitution or fundamental form of governance, and legislation was divided into two types; statutes, passed by the Governors (see below) and ordinances issued by the Society (all the Fellows of the Inn). A third method used was to have individual Fellows promise to fulfill a certain duty; the first known example is from 1435, and starts \"Here folowen certaynes covenantes and promyses made to the felloweshippe of Lyncoll' Yne\".<ref>Simpson (1970) p.247</ref> The increase of the size of the Inn led to a loss of its partially democratic nature, first in 1494 when it was decided that only Benchers and Governors should have a voice in [[call to the Bar|calling people to the Bar]] and, by the end of the sixteenth century, Benchers were almost entirely in control.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.256</ref>\n\nAdmissions were recorded in the black books and divided into two categories: Clerks (''Clerici'') who were admitted to Clerks' Commons; and Fellows ''Socii'' who were admitted to Fellows' Commons. All entrants swore the same oath regardless of category, and some Fellows were permitted to dine in Clerks' Commons as it cost less, making it difficult for academics to sometimes distinguish between the two \u2013 Walker, the editor of the Black Books, maintains that the two categories were one and the same. During the 15th century, the Fellows began to be called Masters, and the gap between Masters and Clerks gradually grew, with an order in 1505 that no Master was to be found in Clerks' Commons unless studying a point of law there.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.243</ref> By 1466, the Fellows were divided into Benchers, those \"[[Bar (law)|at the Bar]]\" (''ad barram'', also known as \"utter barristers\" or simply \"barristers\"), and those \"not at the Bar\" (''extra barram''). By 1502, the ''extra barram'' Fellows were being referred to as \"inner barristers\", in contrast to the \"utter\" or \"outer\" barristers.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.250</ref>\n\nIn [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]]'s time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be [[called to the Bar]] was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward.<ref name=\"heward\">Lord Mansfield: A Biography of William Murray 1st Earl of Mansfield 1705\u20131793 Lord Chief Justice for 32 years.

In Lincoln's Inn, the idea of a Bencher was believed to have begun far earlier than elsewhere; there are records of four Benchers being sworn in 1440.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.133</ref>\n\n[[William Searle Holdsworth|William Holdsworth]] and the editor of the Black Books both concluded that Benchers were, from the earliest times, the governors of the Inn, unlike other Inns who started with [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Readers]].<ref>Simpson (1970) p.242</ref> A.W.B. Simpson, writing at a later date, decided based on the Black Books that the Benchers were not the original governing body, and that the Inn was instead ruled by Governors (or ''gubernatores''), sometimes called Rulers, who led the Inn. The Governors were elected to serve a year-long term, with between four and six sitting at any one time.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.245</ref>\n\nThe first record of Benchers comes from 1478, when John Glynne was expelled from the Society for using \"presumptious and unsuitable words\" in front of the governors and \"other fellows of the Bench\", and a piece of legislation passed in 1489 was \"ordained by the governors and other the worshipfuls of the Bench\"{{clarify|date=November 2012|reason=What does this mean? Is there a typo?}}. By the late 15th century, the ruling group were the Governors (who were always Benchers) with assistance and advice from the other \"masters of the Bench\", and occasional votes from the entire Society.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.248</ref> The Benchers were still subordinate to the Governors, however; a note from 1505 shows the admission of two Benchers \"to aid and advice for the good governing of the Inn, but not to vote\". The practice of using Governors died out in 1572 and, from 1584, the term was applied to Benchers, with the power of a Governor and a new Bencher being synonymous.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.249</ref>\n\nThere are approximately 296 Benchers as of November 2013{{When|date=November 2013}}, with the body consisting of those members of the Inn elected to high judicial office, those who have sat as [[Queen's Counsel]] for six or seven years and some of the more distinguished \"junior\" barristers (those barristers who are not Queen's Counsel). There are also \"additional benchers\"\u2014members of the Inn who have been successful in a profession other than the law, who have the rights of a normal bencher except that they cannot hold an office, such as Treasurer. In addition there are \"honorary benchers\", who hold all the rights of a Bencher except the right to vote and the right to hold an office. These are people of \"sufficient distinction\" who have been elected by the Inn, and includes people such as [[Margaret Thatcher]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].\n\nIn common with the other Inns, Lincoln's Inn also has a \"Royal Bencher\"\u2014a member or members of the Royal Family who have been elected Benchers. The present Royal Bencher is [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] who was elected after the death of the previous incumbent [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].  In 1943, when she was elected as Royal Bencher, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] became the first female Bencher in any Inn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/benchers.asp |title=Lincolns Inn History \u2013 Benchers |publisher=Lincoln's Inn |accessdate=2009-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014200352/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/benchers.asp |archivedate=14 October 2008 }}</ref> His Royal Highness Prince Andrew Duke of York was elected a Royal Bencher in December 2012.\n\n==Buildings and architectural points of note==\nThe Inn is situated between [[Chancery Lane]] and Lincoln's Inn Fields, north of [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]]s and south of [[Gray's Inn]]. The Inn is surrounded by a brick wall separating it from the neighbourhood; this was first erected in 1562, and it is said that [[Ben Jonson]] did some of the brickwork.<ref name=ed1>Edward (1860) p.96</ref> The only surviving part is that on the western side between the North Lawn and the Fields. As well as the major buildings discussed below, the Inn consists of three squares; Old Square, Old Buildings, [[Stone Buildings]] and Hardwicke buildings.\n\n[[File:Lincoln's Inn 20130413 126.jpg|thumb|The two specimens of early 16th century mural paintings upon plaster were uncovered in the pictured room when the original building of 1538 was partially reconstructed in the years 1969\u20131970 and after preservation were replaced in the same building.]]\n\nFirst built in 1683, New Square, sometimes known as Serle Court,<ref>Spilsbury (1850 p.35</ref> finished in about 1697. New Square was originally named Serle's Court because it was built as a compromise between the Inn and Henry Serle over ownership of the land. A compromise was made in 1682, and Serle built eleven brick sets of chambers on three sides of the square between 1682 and 1693.<ref>Spilsbury (1850 p.81</ref> Alterations were made in 1843, when the open area in the middle was replaced by gardens and lawns.

The eastern side along Chancery Lane and the western backing onto the North Lawn. These provide the standard layout of 'staircases' of working chambers. From the North Lawn there is no access but the west range provides a fine institutional range of some distinction.\n\nNo. 10 was originally provided by the Inn to strengthen its ties with [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] (which used to be held in the Old Hall) as the office of the [[Six Clerks]] of the [[Court of Chancery]], with the Inn taking it back when the Clerks were abolished and the Court moved to the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in 1882.<ref name=\"chambers\"/> It is currently used as the headquarters of the [[Inns of Court & City Yeomanry]], part of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The Officers Mess facilities make use of the principal rooms. Lincoln's Inn has maintained a corps of volunteers in times of war since 1585, when 95 members of the Inn made a pledge to protect [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] against Spain. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] gave the then-temporary unit the epithet \"The Devil's Own\", which remains attached to the Regiment to this day.<ref name=\"chambers\"/> There is a large War Memorial between New Square and the North lawn containing the names of the members of the Inn killed in the First World War and World War 2.\n\n[[File:Lincoln's Inn 20130413 145 - Copy (2).jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln's Inn, building 1 to 4]]\n\nOld Square and Old Buildings were built between 1525 and 1609, initially running between numbers 1 and 26. Although 1 exists near the Gatehouse, the others now only run from 16 to 24, with some buildings having been merged to the point where the entrances for 25 and 26 now frame windows, not doorways. Hardwicke Buildings was built in the 1960s, was originally named 'Hale Court', between the east range of New Square name changed in the 1990s. The buildings of Lincoln's Inn in Old Square, New Square and Stone Buildings are normally divided into four or five floors of [[Chambers (law)|chambers]], with residential flats on the top floor.

The Old Hall is 71 feet long and 32 feet wide, although little remains of the original size and shape; it was significantly altered in 1625, 1652, 1706 and 1819.<ref name=w2>Barton (1928) p.261</ref> A former librarian reported that it was \"extensively remodelled\" by [[Francis Bernasconi]] in 1800. This remodelling led to the covering of the oak beams with a curved plaster ceiling, \"a most barbarous innovation\".<ref name=w2/> The weight of the plaster created the risk that the roof would collapse, and between 1924 and 1927 [[John William Simpson|Sir John Simpson]] dismantled the entire hall, straightening warped timbers, removing the plaster, replacing any unserviceable sections and then putting the entire hall back together. It was reopened on 22 November 1928 by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref name=linn1>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/oldhall.asp |title=Lincoln's Inn History \u2013 Old Hall |publisher=Lincoln's Inn |accessdate=2009-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603090117/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/oldhall.asp |archivedate=3 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAs well as its use for revels, [[moot court|moots]] and feasts, the Old Hall was also used as a court. The [[Master of the Rolls]] sat there between 1717 and 1724 while the Rolls Court was being rebuilt, and [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot|Lord Talbot]] used it as a court in 1733. From 1737 onward it was used to house the [[Court of Chancery]], a practice that ended with the opening of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]].<ref name=\"w2\"/> The Hall's most famous use as a court is in the start of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]'', which opens with \"London.

It is bordered by the Lincoln Inn chambers, and is visible from the western Gatehouse.  Centred on the New Square Lawn is Jubilee Fountain.  After the original fountain from 1970 was removed, William Pye installed the new Jubilee fountain in 2003, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williampye.com/works/jubilee-fountain |title=Jubilee Fountain \u2013 Work William Pye Water Sculpture |publisher=Williampye.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>  The construction of the fountain was funded by David Shirley.  \nThe Jubilee fountain is a two tier fountain centered in New Square.  The top level of the fountain creates arches in the air with the water, and the lower level has complementary tiny fountains.  A photo of the fountain can be found on the designer's website\n\n===East  Terrace Underground development, New Library and New Teaching Facilities===\nThe Inn has self funded a major improvement and extension of its facilities from 2016 to 2018. The Inn being a [[conservation area]] and consisting of [[listed buildings]] could not simply add modern structures within the precincts without considerable difficulty of their impact on the current layout and planning objections by interest groups, as well indeed from members of the Inn. The improvement requirements for the Library and teaching activities were partly addressed by demolition of the Under Treasurer's House on the north side of the Library, which was a post-WW2 building, replacing it with an extension to the Reading Rooms and Book Stack. The solution of providing a 150-seat Lecture Theatre and Tutorial Rooms was to exploit the space under the large east terrace of the Great Hall. \n\nThe Inn decided to name the new education suite the Ashworth Centre after Mercy Ashworth, one of the first women to be called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn. On 13 December 2018, The Queen along with the Duke of York (Royal Bencher of the Inn) officially opened the Ashworth Centre and re-opened the Great Hall after its renovation (originally opened by Queen Victoria in 1845).\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:Bloye shield on Fountain Court, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham 1.JPG|thumb|An approximation of the arms (but the lion should be [[purpure]] in colour)]]\nFor many years, the Inn used the arms of the [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|3rd Earl of Lincoln]] as their own; in [[blazon]], a \"lion [[Rampant|rampant]] [[purpure]] in a field [[Or (heraldry)|or]]\", which is a purple lion on a gold field. Around 1699, Sir Richard Holford discovered the Inn's own coat of arms on a manuscript, granted to them in 1516.

(The other three are [[Middle Temple]], [[Inner Temple]] and [[Gray's Inn]].) Lincoln's Inn is recognised as being one of the world's most prestigious professional bodies of judges and lawyers.\n\nLincoln's Inn is situated in [[Holborn]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], just on the border with the [[City of London]] and the [[City of Westminster]], and across the road from [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], [[Royal Courts of Justice]] and [[King's College London]]'s [[Maughan Library]]. The nearest tube station is [[Holborn tube station]] or [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]].\n\nLincoln's Inn is the largest Inn, covering {{convert|11|acre|ha|abbr=off}}. It is believed to be named after [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the 12th and early 13th centuries, the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. Then two events happened which ended this form of legal education: firstly, a [[papal bull]] in 1218 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the [[common law]], rather than [[canon law]];<ref>Bellot (1902) p. 32</ref> and secondly, a decree by [[Henry III of England]] on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London.<ref>Douthwaite (1886) p.2</ref> The secular lawyers migrated to the hamlet of [[Holborn]], near to the law courts at [[Westminster Hall]] and outside the City.<ref name=\"counselmagazine1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.counselmagazine.co.uk/articles/uncommon-counsel-2-barts-butchers-and-barristers|title=Uncommon counsel (2): Barts, butchers and barristers|publisher=Counsel|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles & Holborn Civil Parish Map 1870.png|thumb|250px|left|A map showing the boundaries of the Inn in 1870]]\n\nAs with the other Inns of Court, the precise date of founding of Lincoln's Inn is unknown. The Inn can claim the oldest records \u2013 its \"black books\" documenting the minutes of the governing council go back to 1422, and the earliest entries show that the inn was at that point an organised and disciplined body.<ref>Barton (1928) p.7</ref> The [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|third Earl of Lincoln]] had encouraged lawyers to move to Holborn, and they moved to [[Thavie's Inn]], one of the [[Inns of Chancery]], later expanding into [[Furnival's Inn]] as well.<ref>Barton (1928) p.256</ref> It is felt that Lincoln's Inn became a formally organised inn of court soon after the earl's death in 1310.<ref>Spilsbury (1850) p.32</ref>\n\nAt some point before 1422, the greater part of \"Lincoln's Inn\", as they had become known, after the Earl, moved to the estate of [[Ralph Neville]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], near [[Chancery Lane]]. They retained Thavie's and Furnival's Inn, using them as \"training houses\" for young lawyers, and fully purchased the properties in 1550 and 1547 respectively.<ref>Barton (1928) p.257</ref> In 1537, the land Lincoln's Inn sat on was sold by Bishop [[Richard Sampson]] to a [[Bencher]] named William Suliard, and his son sold the land to Lincoln's Inn in 1580.<ref>Barton (1928) p.258</ref> The Inn became formally organised as a place of legal education thanks to a decree in 1464, which required a [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Reader]] to give  lectures to the law students there.<ref>Ringrose (1909) p.81</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, the Inn was not a particularly prosperous one, and the Benchers, particularly [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], are credited with fixing this situation.<ref>Pulling (1884) p.142</ref>\n\n==Structure and governance==\n[[File:New Hall of Lincoln's Inn, London by Henry Fox Talbot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|New Hall of Lincoln's Inn, London, by [[Henry Fox Talbot]], circa 1841/46]]\nLincoln's Inn had no constitution or fundamental form of governance, and legislation was divided into two types; statutes, passed by the Governors (see below) and ordinances issued by the Society (all the Fellows of the Inn). A third method used was to have individual Fellows promise to fulfill a certain duty; the first known example is from 1435, and starts \"Here folowen certaynes covenantes and promyses made to the felloweshippe of Lyncoll' Yne\".<ref>Simpson (1970) p.247</ref> The increase of the size of the Inn led to a loss of its partially democratic nature, first in 1494 when it was decided that only Benchers and Governors should have a voice in [[call to the Bar|calling people to the Bar]] and, by the end of the sixteenth century, Benchers were almost entirely in control.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.256</ref>\n\nAdmissions were recorded in the black books and divided into two categories: Clerks (''Clerici'') who were admitted to Clerks' Commons; and Fellows ''Socii'' who were admitted to Fellows' Commons. All entrants swore the same oath regardless of category, and some Fellows were permitted to dine in Clerks' Commons as it cost less, making it difficult for academics to sometimes distinguish between the two \u2013 Walker, the editor of the Black Books, maintains that the two categories were one and the same. During the 15th century, the Fellows began to be called Masters, and the gap between Masters and Clerks gradually grew, with an order in 1505 that no Master was to be found in Clerks' Commons unless studying a point of law there.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.243</ref> By 1466, the Fellows were divided into Benchers, those \"[[Bar (law)|at the Bar]]\" (''ad barram'', also known as \"utter barristers\" or simply \"barristers\"), and those \"not at the Bar\" (''extra barram''). By 1502, the ''extra barram'' Fellows were being referred to as \"inner barristers\", in contrast to the \"utter\" or \"outer\" barristers.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.250</ref>\n\nIn [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]]'s time, there was no formal legal education, and the only requirement for a person to be [[called to the Bar]] was for him to have eaten five dinners a term at Lincoln's Inn, and to have read the first sentence of a paper prepared for him by the steward.<ref name=\"heward\">Lord Mansfield: A Biography of William Murray 1st Earl of Mansfield 1705\u20131793 Lord Chief Justice for 32 years.

The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn, which were used for dining and during [[moot court|moots]], and the term originally had no significance. In Lincoln's Inn, the idea of a Bencher was believed to have begun far earlier than elsewhere; there are records of four Benchers being sworn in 1440.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.133</ref>\n\n[[William Searle Holdsworth|William Holdsworth]] and the editor of the Black Books both concluded that Benchers were, from the earliest times, the governors of the Inn, unlike other Inns who started with [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Readers]].<ref>Simpson (1970) p.242</ref> A.W.B. Simpson, writing at a later date, decided based on the Black Books that the Benchers were not the original governing body, and that the Inn was instead ruled by Governors (or ''gubernatores''), sometimes called Rulers, who led the Inn. The Governors were elected to serve a year-long term, with between four and six sitting at any one time.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.245</ref>\n\nThe first record of Benchers comes from 1478, when John Glynne was expelled from the Society for using \"presumptious and unsuitable words\" in front of the governors and \"other fellows of the Bench\", and a piece of legislation passed in 1489 was \"ordained by the governors and other the worshipfuls of the Bench\"{{clarify|date=November 2012|reason=What does this mean? Is there a typo?}}. By the late 15th century, the ruling group were the Governors (who were always Benchers) with assistance and advice from the other \"masters of the Bench\", and occasional votes from the entire Society.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.248</ref> The Benchers were still subordinate to the Governors, however; a note from 1505 shows the admission of two Benchers \"to aid and advice for the good governing of the Inn, but not to vote\". The practice of using Governors died out in 1572 and, from 1584, the term was applied to Benchers, with the power of a Governor and a new Bencher being synonymous.<ref>Simpson (1970) p.249</ref>\n\nThere are approximately 296 Benchers as of November 2013{{When|date=November 2013}}, with the body consisting of those members of the Inn elected to high judicial office, those who have sat as [[Queen's Counsel]] for six or seven years and some of the more distinguished \"junior\" barristers (those barristers who are not Queen's Counsel). There are also \"additional benchers\"\u2014members of the Inn who have been successful in a profession other than the law, who have the rights of a normal bencher except that they cannot hold an office, such as Treasurer. In addition there are \"honorary benchers\", who hold all the rights of a Bencher except the right to vote and the right to hold an office. These are people of \"sufficient distinction\" who have been elected by the Inn, and includes people such as [[Margaret Thatcher]], former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].\n\nIn common with the other Inns, Lincoln's Inn also has a \"Royal Bencher\"\u2014a member or members of the Royal Family who have been elected Benchers. The present Royal Bencher is [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]] who was elected after the death of the previous incumbent [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].  In 1943, when she was elected as Royal Bencher, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] became the first female Bencher in any Inn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/benchers.asp |title=Lincolns Inn History \u2013 Benchers |publisher=Lincoln's Inn |accessdate=2009-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014200352/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/benchers.asp |archivedate=14 October 2008 }}</ref> His Royal Highness Prince Andrew Duke of York was elected a Royal Bencher in December 2012.\n\n==Buildings and architectural points of note==\nThe Inn is situated between [[Chancery Lane]] and Lincoln's Inn Fields, north of [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]]s and south of [[Gray's Inn]]. The Inn is surrounded by a brick wall separating it from the neighbourhood; this was first erected in 1562, and it is said that [[Ben Jonson]] did some of the brickwork.<ref name=ed1>Edward (1860) p.96</ref> The only surviving part is that on the western side between the North Lawn and the Fields. As well as the major buildings discussed below, the Inn consists of three squares; Old Square, Old Buildings, [[Stone Buildings]] and Hardwicke buildings.\n\n[[File:Lincoln's Inn 20130413 126.jpg|thumb|The two specimens of early 16th century mural paintings upon plaster were uncovered in the pictured room when the original building of 1538 was partially reconstructed in the years 1969\u20131970 and after preservation were replaced in the same building.]]\n\nFirst built in 1683, New Square, sometimes known as Serle Court,<ref>Spilsbury (1850 p.35</ref> finished in about 1697. New Square was originally named Serle's Court because it was built as a compromise between the Inn and Henry Serle over ownership of the land. A compromise was made in 1682, and Serle built eleven brick sets of chambers on three sides of the square between 1682 and 1693.<ref>Spilsbury (1850 p.81</ref> Alterations were made in 1843, when the open area in the middle was replaced by gardens and lawns.

From 'within' it appears as a cul de sac rather than a square, the two ranges closed to the north with a third which originally contained the library. The eastern side along Chancery Lane and the western backing onto the North Lawn. These provide the standard layout of 'staircases' of working chambers. From the North Lawn there is no access but the west range provides a fine institutional range of some distinction.\n\nNo. 10 was originally provided by the Inn to strengthen its ties with [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] (which used to be held in the Old Hall) as the office of the [[Six Clerks]] of the [[Court of Chancery]], with the Inn taking it back when the Clerks were abolished and the Court moved to the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in 1882.<ref name=\"chambers\"/> It is currently used as the headquarters of the [[Inns of Court & City Yeomanry]], part of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The Officers Mess facilities make use of the principal rooms. Lincoln's Inn has maintained a corps of volunteers in times of war since 1585, when 95 members of the Inn made a pledge to protect [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] against Spain. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] gave the then-temporary unit the epithet \"The Devil's Own\", which remains attached to the Regiment to this day.<ref name=\"chambers\"/> There is a large War Memorial between New Square and the North lawn containing the names of the members of the Inn killed in the First World War and World War 2.\n\n[[File:Lincoln's Inn 20130413 145 - Copy (2).jpg|thumb|left|Lincoln's Inn, building 1 to 4]]\n\nOld Square and Old Buildings were built between 1525 and 1609, initially running between numbers 1 and 26. Although 1 exists near the Gatehouse, the others now only run from 16 to 24, with some buildings having been merged to the point where the entrances for 25 and 26 now frame windows, not doorways. Hardwicke Buildings was built in the 1960s, was originally named 'Hale Court', between the east range of New Square name changed in the 1990s. The buildings of Lincoln's Inn in Old Square, New Square and Stone Buildings are normally divided into four or five floors of [[Chambers (law)|chambers]], with residential flats on the top floor. The buildings are used both by [[barrister]]s and [[solicitor]]s and other professional bodies.<ref name=\"chambers\"/>\n\n===Old Hall===\n[[File:Lincoln's Inn Old Hall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lincoln's Inn Old Hall]]\nThe Old Hall dates from at least 1489, when it replaced the smaller \"bishops hall\". The Old Hall is 71 feet long and 32 feet wide, although little remains of the original size and shape; it was significantly altered in 1625, 1652, 1706 and 1819.<ref name=w2>Barton (1928) p.261</ref> A former librarian reported that it was \"extensively remodelled\" by [[Francis Bernasconi]] in 1800. This remodelling led to the covering of the oak beams with a curved plaster ceiling, \"a most barbarous innovation\".<ref name=w2/> The weight of the plaster created the risk that the roof would collapse, and between 1924 and 1927 [[John William Simpson|Sir John Simpson]] dismantled the entire hall, straightening warped timbers, removing the plaster, replacing any unserviceable sections and then putting the entire hall back together. It was reopened on 22 November 1928 by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref name=linn1>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/oldhall.asp |title=Lincoln's Inn History \u2013 Old Hall |publisher=Lincoln's Inn |accessdate=2009-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603090117/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/oldhall.asp |archivedate=3 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAs well as its use for revels, [[moot court|moots]] and feasts, the Old Hall was also used as a court. The [[Master of the Rolls]] sat there between 1717 and 1724 while the Rolls Court was being rebuilt, and [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot|Lord Talbot]] used it as a court in 1733. From 1737 onward it was used to house the [[Court of Chancery]], a practice that ended with the opening of the [[Royal Courts of Justice]].<ref name=\"w2\"/> The Hall's most famous use as a court is in the start of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Bleak House]]'', which opens with \"London.

The bell would also chime between 12:30 and 1:00 pm when a Bencher had died.<ref name=\"TheChapel\" /> Inside the chapel are six stained glass windows, three on each side, designed by the [[Abraham van Linge|Van Linge]] family.<ref> Barton (1928) p.264</ref>\n\nThe chapel's first [[pipe organ]] was a Flight & Robson model installed in 1820.<ref name=AES2011>{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/events/130/specialevents/?ID=2708 |title=AES London 2011 Organ Recital |publisher=[[Audio Engineering Society]] |accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref> A substantial William Hill organ replaced it in 1856; a model designed at the peak of his skill, with thick lead and tin pipes,<ref>{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Thistlethwaite |title=The making of the Victorian organ |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-66364-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bowkJFC9rekC&pg=PA237 237]}}</ref> a set of pedals, and three manuals.<ref name=AES2011/> During its service years it was rebuilt nine times, the final overhaul carried out in 1969.

The Inn's membership had grown to the point where the Old Hall was too small for meetings, and so the Benchers decided to construct a new hall, also containing sizable rooms for their use, and a library. The new building was designed by [[Philip Hardwick]], with the foundation stone laid on 20 April 1843 by [[James Lewis Knight-Bruce]], the Treasurer.<ref>Barton (1928) p.267</ref>\n\nThe building was completed by 1845, and opened by [[Queen Victoria]] on 30 October.<ref name=\"linn3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/greathall.asp |title=Lincolns Inn History \u2013 Great Hall |publisher=Lincoln's Inn |accessdate=2009-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017154305/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/greathall.asp |archivedate=17 October 2008 }}</ref> The Hall is 120 feet long, 45 feet wide, and 62 feet high, much larger than the Old Hall.<ref>Barton (1928) p.268</ref> The Great Hall is used for the [[call to the Bar]], as a dining place and for concerts arranged through the Bar Musical Society.<ref name=\"linn3\"/>\n\nThe lower ground floor was divided by a mezzanine in 2007 and the upper part became the Members Common Room for informal dining and with a lounge. It replaced the Junior Common Room, Barristers Members Room and Benchers Room as a social facility. In effect it is a club providing bar and restaurant facilities for all 'entitled' persons, i.e. members of the Inn and its bona fide tenants.\n\n===Library===\nThe Library was first mentioned in 1471, and originally existed in a building next to the Old Hall before being moved to a set of chambers at No. 2 Stone Buildings in 1787. A bequest by John Nethersale in 1497 is recorded as an early acquisition.<ref>page 48 'The Library of Lincoln's Inn' {{Citation | author1=University of London | author2=Rye, Reginald Arthur, 1876\u20131945 | author3=University of California Libraries | title=The libraries of London: a guide for students | journal=Nature | volume=78 | issue=2020 | pages=244 | date=1908 | publisher=London, University of London | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/1014000 | accessdate=23 February 2014 | bibcode=1908Natur..78S.244. | doi=10.1038/078244c0 | hdl=2027/gri.ark:/13960/t4rj78190 | hdl-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe current Library was built as part of the complex containing the Great Hall, to the designs of Hardwick and was finished in 1845 being formally opened by Queen Victoria. At this point it was 80 feet long, 40 feet wide and 44 feet high.<ref>Edward (1860) p.97</ref> It was extended, almost doubled, in 1872 by [[George Gilbert Scott]] in the same style. The ground floor contained a Court room which became part of the Library facilities when the Court of Chancery moved out of the Inn in the 1880s. It has since 2010 been utilised as a lecture room and during the developments of 2016 to 2018 became the 'interim' Members Common Room.\n\nThe Library contains a large collection of rare books, including the Hale Manuscripts, the complete collection of [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]], which he left to the Inn on his death in 1676.

It is bordered by the Lincoln Inn chambers, and is visible from the western Gatehouse.  Centred on the New Square Lawn is Jubilee Fountain.  After the original fountain from 1970 was removed, William Pye installed the new Jubilee fountain in 2003, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williampye.com/works/jubilee-fountain |title=Jubilee Fountain \u2013 Work William Pye Water Sculpture |publisher=Williampye.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>  The construction of the fountain was funded by David Shirley.  \nThe Jubilee fountain is a two tier fountain centered in New Square.  The top level of the fountain creates arches in the air with the water, and the lower level has complementary tiny fountains.  A photo of the fountain can be found on the designer's website\n\n===East  Terrace Underground development, New Library and New Teaching Facilities===\nThe Inn has self funded a major improvement and extension of its facilities from 2016 to 2018. The Inn being a [[conservation area]] and consisting of [[listed buildings]] could not simply add modern structures within the precincts without considerable difficulty of their impact on the current layout and planning objections by interest groups, as well indeed from members of the Inn. The improvement requirements for the Library and teaching activities were partly addressed by demolition of the Under Treasurer's House on the north side of the Library, which was a post-WW2 building, replacing it with an extension to the Reading Rooms and Book Stack. The solution of providing a 150-seat Lecture Theatre and Tutorial Rooms was to exploit the space under the large east terrace of the Great Hall. \n\nThe Inn decided to name the new education suite the Ashworth Centre after Mercy Ashworth, one of the first women to be called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn. On 13 December 2018, The Queen along with the Duke of York (Royal Bencher of the Inn) officially opened the Ashworth Centre and re-opened the Great Hall after its renovation (originally opened by Queen Victoria in 1845).\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:Bloye shield on Fountain Court, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham 1.JPG|thumb|An approximation of the arms (but the lion should be [[purpure]] in colour)]]\nFor many years, the Inn used the arms of the [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|3rd Earl of Lincoln]] as their own; in [[blazon]], a \"lion [[Rampant|rampant]] [[purpure]] in a field [[Or (heraldry)|or]]\", which is a purple lion on a gold field. Around 1699, Sir Richard Holford discovered the Inn's own coat of arms on a manuscript, granted to them in 1516. The arms are \"azure seme de [[millrind|fer moline]] or, on a dexter canton or a lion rampant purpure\". Following validation using some heraldry books, the arms were placed first in the council chamber and then in the library. Since then, they have been used continuously in Lincoln's Inn.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.135</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n*[[List of members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n\n==Preachers of Lincoln's Inn==\nThe office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn or Preacher to Lincoln's Inn is a clerical office in the [[Church of England]].<ref>[http://www.online-law.co.uk/bar/lincolns/history/chapel.html online-law.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315151433/http://www.online-law.co.uk/bar/lincolns/history/chapel.html |date=15 March 2007 }}</ref>  Past incumbents include:\n*[[John Donne]] (1616\u20131622)<ref>{{cite DNB|authorlink= Augustus Jessopp|last=Jessopp|first=Augustus||wstitle=Donne, John  (1573-1631)|volume=15}}</ref>\n*[[Reginald Heber]] (1822\u2013?)<ref>{{cite DNB|authorlink= John Henry Overton |last=Overton|first=John Henry||wstitle=Heber, Reginald|volume=25}}</ref>\n*[[Edward Maltby]] (1824\u20131833)<ref>{{cite DNB|authorlink=Alexander Gordon (Unitarian)|last=Gordon|first=Alexander|wstitle=Maltby, Edward|volume=35}}</ref>\n*[[William Van Mildert]] (1812\u20131819)<ref>{{cite DNB|last=Courtney|first=William Prideaux|wstitle=Van Mildert, William|volume=58}}</ref>\n*[[Henry Wace (Anglican priest)|Henry Wace]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/archives/collect/10wa20-1.html|title=Aleph main menu|website=www.kcl.ac.uk}}</ref>\n*[[William Warburton]] (1746\u2013?)<ref>{{cite DNB|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|authorlink=Leslie Stephen|wstitle=Warburton, William|volume=59}}</ref>\n*[[Derek Watson (priest)|Derek Watson]]\n*[[Hastings Rashdall]]<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Rayner |first=Margaret J. |year=2005 |title=The Theology of Hastings Rashdall: A Study of His Part in Theological Debates During His Lifetime |url=https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.423374 |degree=PhD |publisher=University of Gloucestershire |page=13 |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Other organisations based in the Inn==\n[[File:68 Signal Squadron - 10 Stone Building 1.jpg|thumb|[[68 Signal Squadron]]]]\n*The volunteer militia, later formalised (1908) within the Territorial Army, and today forming the headquarters of [[68 Signal Squadron]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lincoln's Inn Fields]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Dunbar Plunket|author2=Benham, Charles |author3=Watt, Francis |title=The Story of the Inns of Court|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|year=1928|oclc=77565485}}\n*{{cite book|last=Douthwaite|first=William Ralph|title=Gray's Inn, Its History & Associations|url=https://archive.org/details/graysinnitshist01doutgoog|publisher=Reeves and Turner|year=1886|oclc=2578698}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Draper|first=Warwick|year=1906|title=The Watts Fresco in Lincoln's Inn |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=9|issue=37|issn=0951-0788}}\n*{{cite book|last=Loftie|first=W.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking.

It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], the last other major candidate in the Democratic primary, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden is currently the oldest major party presumptive nominee in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, he will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] were incumbent vice presidents at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections, respectively).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week. As of March 21, he has received 11,446,331 popular votes. \n\nOn March 17, 2020, having won enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the convention, Trump became the presumptive nominee.<ref name=\"u9rZ3\" /> Weld suspended his campaign the next day.<ref name=\"HCjk9\" />\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Donald Trump series |expanded=Campaigns}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n\n| colspan=\"28\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |\n\n[[File:Republican Disc.png|65px|center|link=Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Republican Party ticket\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Donald Trump}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Republican Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Mike Pence}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#ffd0d7;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-\n| [[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump.jpg|center|200x200px|border]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates.

Eisenhower's administration.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2004|location=Chicago, IL|pages=21}}</ref> Under the criteria of the State Department's security principles, \u201cdisloyal\u201d persons included communists, their associates, and those guilty of espionage, along with persons known for \u201chabitual drunkenness, sexual perversion, moral turpitude, financial irresponsibility or criminal record,\u201d and were to be denied federal employment.<ref name=\":4\" /> With the inclusion of \u201csexual perversion\u201d among those considered unsuitable for federal employment, discriminating against homosexuals was explicitly built into the State Department, and it would be grandfathered into federal governmental protocol and procedure.\n\nEven before the 1947 establishment of State Department security principles, the United States military had developed discriminatory policies targeting gay men and lesbians. In 1940, President Roosevelt and his Selective Service advisers were convinced by psychiatrists of the need to implement screening programs to determine the mental health of potential soldiers as to reduce the cost of psychiatric rehabilitation for returning veterans.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=10}}</ref> Although the initial plan for psychiatric screenings of military recruits included no direct references to homosexuality, within a year, direct references were added \u2013 this development in military bureaucratic processes contributed towards the momentum of the military's preoccupation with homosexuality during World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=11}}</ref> The new psychiatric screening directives and procedures introduced to the military the idea that homosexuals were unfit to serve in the armed forces because they were mentally ill: a change from the military's traditional way of approaching homosexuality as a crime.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=33}}</ref> During World War I, punishment of homosexual soldiers was first codified in American military law, and during World War II, final regulations were declared and homosexuals were banned from all branches of the military in 1943.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military|last=Shilts|first=Randy|publisher=Fawcett Columbine Books|year=1994|location=New York, NY|pages=15\u201317}}</ref> Despite all of the regulations, the need for troops allowed for loopholes regarding the accepting/rejection of homosexuals to fight in war.

On one occasion, he went so far as to announce to reporters, \"If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you've got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker.\"<ref>Cuordileone, K.A.  \"'Politics in an Age of Anxiety': Cold War Political Culture and the Crisis in American Masculinity, 1949\u20131960\"  ''The Journal of American History'' 87 (2) (2000): 515\u2013545</ref> At least one recent history has argued that, in linking communism and homosexuality and psychological imbalance, McCarthy was employing guilt-by-association if evidence for communist activity was lacking.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Joy |last1=Damousi|first2=Mariano Ben |last2=Plotkin|title=Psychoanalysis and Politics: Histories of Psychoanalysis Under Conditions of Restricted Political Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhhpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA221|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-992316-8|page=221}}</ref> Political rhetoric at the time often linked communists and homosexuals, and common beliefs among the public were similar, including that both were \"morally weak\" or \u201cpsychologically disturbed\u201d, along with being godless and undermining traditional families.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/summer/lavender.html|title=\"These People Are Frightened to Death\": Congressional Investigations and the Lavender Scare|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFor example, McCarthy spoke on the Senate floor about two individual people, \"Case 14\" and \"Case 62\", as Communists who were \"unsafe risks\", and he directly linked that to their homosexuality.<ref name=\":6\" /> He said a top intelligence official had told him \u201cevery active Communist is twisted mentally or physically\u201d, and he implied that these people were vulnerable to recruitment by Communists because of their \u201cpeculiar mental twists\u201d of homosexuality.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n=== Executive Order 10450 ===\nIn 1953 [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed [[Executive Order 10450]], which set security standards for federal employment and barred homosexuals from working in the federal government. The restrictions set in place were cause for hundreds of gay people to be forcibly outed and fired from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. With a stroke of a pen, President Eisenhower expanded the federal government's anti-homosexual policies and procedures to include every department and agency and every private corporation with a government contract \u2013 affecting the job security of more than six million workers and armed forces personnel.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\">{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=269}}</ref> The executive order was also the cause for the firing of approximately 5,000 gay people from federal employment; this included private contractors and military personnel. Not only did the victims lose their jobs, but also they were forced out of the closet and thrust into the public eye as lesbian or gay.\n\nSpecifically, Truman's loyalty program had been extended through this executive order: \u201csexual perversion\u201d was added to a list of behaviors that would keep a person from holding a position in government. There were many new regulations and policies put into place to detect homosexuals, including gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. The new procedures to search out homosexuals were frequently to interview and look for signs of sexual orientation. They also looked at frequent places these individuals visited, such as gay bars, and they even found people guilty by association. If their friends or family showed signs of being homosexual, they might also be suspected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/items/show/1425|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government \u00b7 OutHistory.org: It's About Time|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1950s, similar repressive and oppressive policies had gone into effect in state and local governments which extended the prohibitions on the employment of lesbians and gay men to cover twelve million workers \u2013 more than twenty percent of the United States labor force \u2013 who now had to sign oaths attesting to their moral purity to get or to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\"/> It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis. Executive Order 10450 stayed partly in effect until 1995 when [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] rescinded the order and put in place the \"[[Don't ask, don't tell]]\" policy for admittance of gays into the military.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/08/05/288942/clinton-issued-order-letting-gays-get-security-clearances-16-years-ago-today/|title=Clinton Issued Order Letting Gays Get Security Clearances 16 Years Ago Today|website=ThinkProgress|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Association of communism with \"subversives\" ===\nBoth homosexuals and [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] members were seen as subversive elements in American society who all shared the same ideals of [[antitheism]], rejection of [[Bourgeoisie#Bourgeois culture|bourgeois culture]] and middle-class morality, and lack of conformity; they were also seen as scheming and manipulative and, most importantly, would put their own agendas above others in the eyes of the general population.<ref name=\"glbtq.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/mccarthyism_S.pdf|title=McCarthyism|last=Prono|first=Luca|date=|website=|publisher=[[glbtq.com]]|accessdate=}}</ref> McCarthy also associated homosexuality and communism as \"threats to the 'American way of life'.\"<ref>Carlson, Dennis. \"Gayness, multicultural education, and community.\" [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=K2_VMQyk-ZMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA233 Beyond black and white: New faces and voices in the U.S. Schools] (1997): 233\u2013256.</ref> [Homosexuals and communists] were perceived as hidden subcultures with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. [They] were thought to recruit the psychologically weak or disturbed [and] many believed the two were working together to undermine the government.<ref name=\":2\" /> David K. Johnson notes that without an idealized traditional American moral fiber, any citizen could succumb to immoral temptations such as homosexuality; and they could ultimately be seduced by communism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=95}}</ref> The association of homosexuality with communism proved to be a convenient political tool to develop and implement homophobic discriminatory policy throughout the federal government. It was easy to convince a Congress dictated by a communist containment policy to respond to the perceived homosexual menace because they were already viewed to be not only subversive social elements of American culture, but subversive political elements. Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: \"The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,\" and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.<ref>Field, Douglas, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DztQtydwimMC American cold war culture]. Edinburgh University Press, 2005.</ref>\n\nSenator [[Kenneth S. Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and anti-nationalism. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: \"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.\" Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: \"But look, Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\"<ref>Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313\u2013316</ref>\n\nThe term \u201cHomintern\u201d was coined in the 1930s, possibly by Cyril Connolly, W.H. Auden, or Harold Norse, as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] term playing off of \"Comintern\" ([[Communist International]]). It was first used to describe an imagined group of gay men who controlled the art world, and later used in reference to \u201ca fantastical gay international that sought to control the world\u201d. In 1952, an article written by [[R. G. Waldeck|R. G Waldeck]] argued that this conspiracy was a real and important reason to expel homosexual people from the State Department, even more important than the possibility of blackmail, and this article was read into the [[Congressional Record]] and cited by others.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWhile the [[Mattachine Society]] was founded by [[Harry Hay]], a former member of the [[Communist Party USA]], Hay resigned from the society when the membership condemned his politics as a threat to the organization he had founded.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lillian Faderman|author2=Stuart Timmons|title=Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians |url=https://archive.org/details/gaylahistoryofse00lill|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02288-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/gaylahistoryofse00lill/page/113 113] |accessdate=May 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Subcommittee on Investigations ===\nThe Subcommittee on Investigations was a subcommittee of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments|Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments]]. This subcommittee led by Senator [[Clyde R.

Republican Senator Kenneth Wherry and Democratic Senator Lester Hill formed a subcommittee to make preliminary investigations into the \u201cInfiltration of Subversives and Moral Perverts into the Executive Branch of the United States Government.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=264}}</ref> No records of the Wherry-Hill investigation survive beyond press coverage and two published reports.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|title=Congressional Investigation and the Lavender Scare.|last=Adkins|first=Judith|date=2016|work=Prologue Magazine}}</ref> One such report contained the statements of the head of the DC Metropolitan Police Department vice squad, Lieutenant Roy Blick, who testified that 5,000 homosexuals lived in Washington D.C. and that around 3,700 were federal employees.<ref name=\":3\" /> Lt. Blick's comments, which were speculative at best, further fueled the media storm surrounding the gays-in-government controversy; the Wherry-Hill preliminary investigation convinced the Senate to launch a full-scale congressional exploration.\n\nThe recommended investigation was assigned to the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments, led by Democrat senator Clyde Hoey, and the full Senate unanimously authorized the investigation into sexual perversion in the federal workforce; with outrage mounting to astronomical heights, no Democrat dared speak out against it lest they risk their political career.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2004|location=Chicago, IL|pages=99}}</ref> Investigating the \u201cEmployment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government,\u201d the subcommittee came to be known as the Hoey Committee and while the White House under President Truman was heavily involved in managing its methodology and processes, the driving force behind the congressional investigation of homosexuals was its chief counsel, former FBI agent Francis Flanagan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=David K. Johnson. The Lavender Scare, 103|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2004|location=Chicago, IL|pages=103}}</ref> The Hoey Committee consulted with and heard testimony from law enforcement, judicial authorities, military and governmental security officers, and medical experts. Rather than uncovering any evidence of any federal employee being blackmailed into revealing state secrets on account of their homosexuality, the investigation uncovered considerable differences of opinion, even within the government, over federal policy of homosexual exclusion and over whether foreign government agents had ever attempted to blackmail homosexuals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2004|location=Chicago, IL|pages=114}}</ref>\n\nThe Hoey Committee's conclusive report, released in mid-December that year, ignored the ambiguities of testimony and deemed authoritatively that there was \u201cno place in the United States Government for persons who violate the laws or the accepted standards of morality,\u201d especially those who \u201cbring disrepute to the Federal service by infamous or scandalous conduct,\u201d stating that lesbians and gay men were \u201cunsuitable\u201d for federal employment because they were \u201csecurity risks\u201d as well as people engaged in illegal and immoral activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoover's War on Gays: Exposing the FBI's \"Sex Deviants\" Program|last=Charles|first=Douglas M.|publisher=The University Press of Kansas|year=2015|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=94}}</ref> The committee recommended that the military's policy and procedure should be used as the model; in the areas of explicit policies, standardized procedures, uniform enforcement, constant vigilance, and coordination with law enforcement agencies regarding homosexuals, the armed services set the precedent. Further, the Hoey Committee report stated that in the past, the federal government \u201cfailed to take a realistic view of the problem of sex perversion,\u201d and that to adequately protect the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d the federal government must \u201cadopt and maintain a realistic and vigilant attitude toward the problem of sex perverts in the Government.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoover's War on Gays: Exposing the FBI's \"Sex Deviants\" Program|last=Charles|first=Douglas M.|publisher=The University Press of Kansas|year=2015|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=95}}</ref>\n\nThe authoritative findings of the Wherry-Hill and Hoey Committee congressional investigations directly helped the Lavender Scare move beyond a strictly Republican rhetoric towards bipartisan appeal, and purging lesbians and gay men from federal employment quickly became part of standard, government -wide policy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoover's War on Gays: Exposing the FBI's \"Sex Deviants\" Program|last=Charles|first=Douglas M.|publisher=The University Press of Kansas|year=2015|isbn=|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=95}}</ref> The major purpose and achievement of the Wherry-Hill and Hoey Committees was the construction and promotion of the belief that homosexuals in the military and federal government constituted security risks who, as individuals or working in conspiracy with members of the Communist Party, threatened the safety of the nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=267}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary views of homosexuality ===\nWashington D.C. had a fairly large and active gay community before McCarthy launched his witch hunt campaign against homosexuals, but as time went on and the climate of the Cold War spread, so too did negative views of homosexuals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because social attitudes toward homosexuality were overwhelmingly negative and the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[mental disorder]], [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communists]] would blackmail homosexual employees of the federal government to provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.<ref>{{cite web |work=Gay Today |url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp |title=Historian David K.

Hooker presented a team of three expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles from her year of research. She chose to leave the interpretation of her results to others, to avoid potential bias. The evaluators concluded that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group. Her demonstration that it is not an illness led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web | url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/hooker2.html#biography | title=Evelyn Hooker, Ph.D.: September 2, 1907 \u2013 November 18, 1996 | publisher=UC Davis | accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Resistance ==\nOne of the first and most influential members of the gay rights movements, [[Frank Kameny]], was thrust into unemployment because of his sexual orientation in 1957. He was working as an astronomer for the United States Army Map Service, but was fired as a result of the Lavender Scare and could never find another job in the United States federal government again. This led to Kameny devoting his life to the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], which in some ways he began.

The FLIC was founded in 1956 and was not disbanded until 1964.

During its active years the FLIC was responsible for more than 200 firings of alleged gay teachers.

Not only did the victims lose their jobs, but also they were forced out of the closet and thrust into the public eye as lesbian or gay.\n\nSpecifically, Truman's loyalty program had been extended through this executive order: \u201csexual perversion\u201d was added to a list of behaviors that would keep a person from holding a position in government. There were many new regulations and policies put into place to detect homosexuals, including gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. The new procedures to search out homosexuals were frequently to interview and look for signs of sexual orientation. They also looked at frequent places these individuals visited, such as gay bars, and they even found people guilty by association. If their friends or family showed signs of being homosexual, they might also be suspected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/items/show/1425|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government \u00b7 OutHistory.org: It's About Time|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1950s, similar repressive and oppressive policies had gone into effect in state and local governments which extended the prohibitions on the employment of lesbians and gay men to cover twelve million workers \u2013 more than twenty percent of the United States labor force \u2013 who now had to sign oaths attesting to their moral purity to get or to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\"/> It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.

It was easy to convince a Congress dictated by a communist containment policy to respond to the perceived homosexual menace because they were already viewed to be not only subversive social elements of American culture, but subversive political elements. Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: \"The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,\" and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.<ref>Field, Douglas, ed.

Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and anti-nationalism. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: \"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.\" Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: \"But look, Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\"<ref>Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313\u2013316</ref>\n\nThe term \u201cHomintern\u201d was coined in the 1930s, possibly by Cyril Connolly, W.H. Auden, or Harold Norse, as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] term playing off of \"Comintern\" ([[Communist International]]). It was first used to describe an imagined group of gay men who controlled the art world, and later used in reference to \u201ca fantastical gay international that sought to control the world\u201d. In 1952, an article written by [[R. G. Waldeck|R.

Further, the Hoey Committee report stated that in the past, the federal government \u201cfailed to take a realistic view of the problem of sex perversion,\u201d and that to adequately protect the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d the federal government must \u201cadopt and maintain a realistic and vigilant attitude toward the problem of sex perverts in the Government.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoover's War on Gays: Exposing the FBI's \"Sex Deviants\" Program|last=Charles|first=Douglas M.|publisher=The University Press of Kansas|year=2015|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=95}}</ref>\n\nThe authoritative findings of the Wherry-Hill and Hoey Committee congressional investigations directly helped the Lavender Scare move beyond a strictly Republican rhetoric towards bipartisan appeal, and purging lesbians and gay men from federal employment quickly became part of standard, government -wide policy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hoover's War on Gays: Exposing the FBI's \"Sex Deviants\" Program|last=Charles|first=Douglas M.|publisher=The University Press of Kansas|year=2015|isbn=|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=95}}</ref> The major purpose and achievement of the Wherry-Hill and Hoey Committees was the construction and promotion of the belief that homosexuals in the military and federal government constituted security risks who, as individuals or working in conspiracy with members of the Communist Party, threatened the safety of the nation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=267}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary views of homosexuality ===\nWashington D.C. had a fairly large and active gay community before McCarthy launched his witch hunt campaign against homosexuals, but as time went on and the climate of the Cold War spread, so too did negative views of homosexuals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because social attitudes toward homosexuality were overwhelmingly negative and the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[mental disorder]], [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communists]] would blackmail homosexual employees of the federal government to provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.<ref>{{cite web |work=Gay Today |url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp |title=Historian David K.

Hooker presented a team of three expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles from her year of research. She chose to leave the interpretation of her results to others, to avoid potential bias. The evaluators concluded that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group. Her demonstration that it is not an illness led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].<ref name=\"ucd\">{{cite web | url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/hooker2.html#biography | title=Evelyn Hooker, Ph.D.: September 2, 1907 \u2013 November 18, 1996 | publisher=UC Davis | accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Resistance ==\nOne of the first and most influential members of the gay rights movements, [[Frank Kameny]], was thrust into unemployment because of his sexual orientation in 1957. He was working as an astronomer for the United States Army Map Service, but was fired as a result of the Lavender Scare and could never find another job in the United States federal government again. This led to Kameny devoting his life to the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], which in some ways he began. In 1965, four years before the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Riots]], Kameny picketed the White House on the grounds of gay rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://notevenpast.org/lavender-scare-cold-war-persecution-gays-and-lesbians-federal-government-2006/|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government by David K.

One such way was that Executive Order 10450, which was not rescinded until 1995, continued to bar gays from entering the military.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another form of the Lavender Scare that persisted was the [[Florida Legislative Investigation Committee]], also referred to as the FLIC and the Johns Committee. The FLIC was founded in 1956 and was not disbanded until 1964. The purpose of the committee was to operate within Florida continuing the work of the Lavender Scare by investigating and firing public school teachers who were gay. During its active years the FLIC was responsible for more than 200 firings of alleged gay teachers. The FLIC was disbanded following the release of the [[Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida|Purple Pamphlet]] due to public outrage over its explicit and pornographic nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://riches.cah.ucf.edu/committee/history.php|title=The Committee Documentary|website=riches.cah.ucf.edu|access-date=2016-03-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329110959/http://riches.cah.ucf.edu/committee/history.php|archivedate=2016-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2017, the State Department formally apologized following suggestion by Senator [[Ben Cardin]].
