The ''Ptychodus'' diet was probably restricted to slow-moving or sessile shellfish, mollusks, invertebrates, larvae, and the occasional sunken carrion of [[Cretaceous]] megafauna that it could manipulate into its mouth. ''P. decurrens'' (found in southern India) ate animals with hard shells.<ref name=omkar/> One of the largest bivalves at the time was the 9-foot ''[[Platyceramus]]'', a shelled mollusk that would have provided a difficult meal for any other creature, but with its crushing palate ''Ptychodus'' could have broken through this durable mollusk with ease.<ref name=\"oceansofkansas.com\"/> Giant ammonites such as the ''[[Parapuzosia seppenradensis]]'', members of the [[Belemnite]] family, squid, and a variety of [[Cretaceous]] crustaceans would also make up the majority of the shark's food.\n\n==Species==\nThere have been 23 species within this genus that have been discovered so far and they include:<ref name=\"PBDB\"/>\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*''Ptychodus altior'' <small> Agassiz 1839 </small>\n*''Ptychodus anonymus'' <small>Williston 1900 </small>\n*''Ptychodus arcuatus''<small> Agassiz 1837 </small>\n*''Ptychodus articulatus'' <small>Agassiz 1837</small>\n*Ptychodus atcoensis <small>Carrillo-Briceno 2013\n<small>\n*''Ptychodus belluccii'' <small>Bonarelli 1899</small>\n*''Ptychodus concentricus'' <small>Agassiz 1839</small>\n*''Ptychodus decurrens'' <small>Agassiz 1839</small>\n*''Ptychodus elevatus'' <small>Leriche 1929</small>\n*''Ptychodus gibberulus'' <small>Agassiz 1837 </small>\n*''Ptychodus janewayii'' <small>Cope 1874 </small>\n*''Ptychodus latissimus'' <small>Agassiz 1843</small>\n*''Ptychodus mahakalensis'' <small>Chiplonkar and Ghare 1977</small>\n*''Ptychodus mammillaris'' <small>Agassiz 1839</small>\n*''Ptychodus marginalis'' <small>Agassiz 1839</small>\n*''[[Ptychodus mortoni]]''<small> Agassiz 1843</small>\n*''Ptychodus multistriatus'' <small>Woodward 1889</small>\n*''Ptychodus oweni'' Dixon <small>1850</small>\n*''Ptychodus paucisulcatus'' <small>Dixon 1850</small>\n*''Ptychodus polygyrus'' <small>Agassiz 1839</small>\n*''Ptychodus rugosus'' <small>Dixon 1850</small>\n*''Ptychodus spectabili'' <small>Agassiz 1837</small>\n*''Ptychodus whipplei'' <small>Marcou 1858</small>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Ptychodus mammillaris.JPG|''Ptychodus mammillaris'' teeth\nFile:Ptychodontidae - Ptychodus decurrens.JPG|Teeth of ''Ptychodus decurrens'' from Cretaceous of United States\nFile:Ptychodontidae - Ptychodus anonymus.JPG|Teeth of ''Ptychodus anonymous'' from Cretaceous of United States\nFile:Ptychodus latissimus 1550.JPG|Teeth of ''Ptychodus'' species\nFile:PtychodusLowerJaw.jpg|The Lower Jaw of the Ptychodus\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Williston, Samuel (1900) ''University Geological Survey of Kansas, Volume VI: Paleontology part II, (Carboniferous invertebrates and Cretaceous fish)''\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Sharks|Palaeontology}}\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Ptychodus}}\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8530000/8530995.stm BBC page on ''Ptychodus mortoni'': \"Giant predatory shark fossil unearthed in Kansas\"]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q648806}}\n\n[[Category:Hybodontiformes]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric shark genera]]\n[[Category:Cretaceous sharks]]\n[[Category:Paleocene sharks]]\n[[Category:Extinct animals of North America]]\n[[Category:Pridoli first appearances]]\n[[Category:Extant Silurian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Elasmobranchii|*]]\n[[Category:Wenlock first appearances]]\n[[Category:Vertebrate subclasses]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte]]\n[[Category:Mooreville Chalk]]\n", "name_user": "Anomalocaris", "label": "safe", "comment": "<small>...<small> \u2192 <small>...</small>, which can't wrap newlines", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptychodus"}
