{"title_page": "United States biological weapons program", "text_new": "{{short description|Military program}}\nThe '''United States biological weapons program''' began in 1943. It was replaced by the [[United States biological defense program]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1918\u20131941)===\n\nThe '''[[United States]] [[biological weapons]] program''' officially began in spring 1943 on orders from U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations. Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of [[World War I]]. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations.

The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

Her autobiographical account of the Holocaust, ''All but My Life'' (1957), was adapted for the 1995 short film, ''[[One Survivor Remembers]]'', which received an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Academy Award]] and an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]], and was selected for the [[National Film Registry]]. She married Kurt Klein (1920\u20132002) in 1946. The Kleins became advocates of Holocaust education and human rights, dedicating most of their lives to promoting tolerance and community service. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Gerda Weissmann Klein also founded [[Citizenship Counts]], a nonprofit organization that champions the value and responsibilities of American citizenship. She has served on the governing board of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], which features her testimony in a permanent exhibit. On February 15, 2011, Klein was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2013, she published a children's adventure story called ''The Windsor Caper'', which had remained hidden away since the 1980s, when it was a weekly serial in ''The Buffalo News''.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1924 in [[Bielsko]] (now [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]]), [[Poland]], a town known for its textile industry, Gerda Weissmann was educated first in public school and then in a Catholic school for girls. She was one of two children born to a middle-class Jewish family;<ref name=\"ushmm\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/phistories/phi_individuals_kurt_gerda_klein_uu.htm Personal Histories: Gerda Weissmann Klein and Kurt Klein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805083152/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/phistories/phi_individuals_kurt_gerda_klein_uu.htm |date=2006-08-05 }}, [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].

Shortly after the invasion began, the family received a telegram from Gerda's uncle saying that the Germans were advancing quickly, and the family should leave Poland immediately. However, Gerda's father had just suffered a heart attack, and doctors advised that he not be moved or subjected to undue stress.\n\nAfter the invasion, Gerda and her family watched in disbelief as people, ethnic Germans living in Poland, whom they had considered friends began flying the Nazi flag and using the Hitler salute. In mid-October, Gerda's older brother Arthur received a letter from the Germans:  as a male between 16 and 50, Arthur (19) was required to register for the army. On October 18, 1939, Arthur complied with the summons and never saw his family again.\n\nGerda and her parents were forced to live in the basement of their home and later in a Jewish [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939 - 1944|ghetto]]. In 1942, Gerda was separated from her father, who was sent to a death camp where he eventually perished that April. In June, her time in the ghetto was over. Left with only the company of her mother, they approached the guard; her mother was sent right, she went left. As Gerda and her mother boarded separate trucks, Gerda leapt out, pleading not to be separated from her sole remaining family member. Moshe Merin, head of the Jewish Community Council, tossed her back inside saying, \"You are too young to die.\" He had saved her life, yet sentenced her mother to death. She was sent to the Dulag (Durchgangslager).\n\n=== In camps ===\nShe was in several camps throughout the war.  First, she was in [[Bolkenhain]], a subcamp of [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], working on the looms (July 1942-August 1943). Gerda was then transferred to [[Marcisz\u00f3w|M\u00e0rzdorf]] working physical labor (August 1943-?). She was quickly moved to [[Kamienna G\u00f3ra|Landeshut]], another subcamp of Gross-Rosen, thanks to the help of several people from Bolkenhain. In Landenshut, she was working the looms once again.  The Germans were losing the war, and Landenshut was shut down (?-May 1944). The last camp Gerda was in was [[Gr\u00fcnberg]].  Gerda was once again working the looms, but it was very different from her former camps. Bolkenhain and Landenshut were both better than other camps, and the girls were treated (somewhat) fairly at those two camps.  Marzdorf was very bad. Gerda almost died from being overworked, but her childhood friend, Ilse, helped get Gerda out. Gr\u00fcnberg was very different. The director was very violent and very often beat the prisoners. The girls who worked outside managed to stay healthy, but the girls who worked on the looms died quickly due to the bad conditions (May 1944-January 1945).\n\n==== Death march ====\nWeissman was among 4000 women who began the 350-mile [[death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] to avoid the advance of the Allied forces. During the death march, Gerda's best friend Ilse told her that she would be all alone now. They fell asleep with Gerda holding Ilse, and when she awoke, her friend had died in her sleep. The forced journey went through [[Dresden]], [[Chemnitz]], [[Zwickau]], [[Reichenbach im Vogtland|Reichenbach]], [[Plauen]], Germany, and on through [[Volary|Wallern]] (now Volary in modern-day [[Czech Republic]]), and she was one of fewer than 120 women who survived exposure to the winter elements, starvation, and arbitrary execution.\n\nDespite such atrocities, Gerda never lost the will to live except for a brief time when she planned to jump in front of a train and end it all, but remembered her father telling her to never consider suicide. She also attributed her survival to the fact that her father had told her to wear her ski boots when it came time to leave the home. The boots proved to be invaluable during the 3 month march in the snow.\n\nHer friends Ilse Kleinzahler, Liesl Steppe and Suse Kunz are buried in a cemetery in Wallern, Czech republic along with 92 others who died along the way.\n\n===Liberation===\nIn May 1945, Gerda was liberated by forces of the [[United States Army]] in [[Volary]], Czechoslovakia;<ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/volary_death_march/index.asp Gerda Weissmann Klein's] testimony at \"THE DEATH MARCH TO VOLARY\" - an exhibition at [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref> these forces included Lieutenant Kurt Klein,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20061207 |title=Voices on Antisemitisim interview with Gerda Weissmann Klein |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=2006-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622194533/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20061207 |archivedate=2007-06-22 }}</ref> who was born in Germany and immigrated to the [[United States]] to escape Nazism as a teenager in 1937. Both of his parents had been killed by the Nazis at Auschwitz. When Gerda and Kurt first met, Weissmann was white-haired, weighed 68 pounds, and was one day shy of her 21st birthday. She was wearing rags, and had not bathed in three years. Kurt simply opened a door for her, and she immediately felt human again. The two became engaged in September 1945 and married in 1946.\n\n==Life after the War==\nGerda and Kurt Klein were married in Paris, France. They settled in [[Kenmore, New York]] and had three children and eight grandchildren. Gerda became involved with several local and national charities and soon began to speak about her experiences during the war.\n\nThe story of Gerda and Kurt's meeting and life together has been featured on numerous television shows, including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]''. A book of their letters, ''The Hours After'', is a poignant collection of correspondence between Gerda and Kurt Klein following the war.\n\nIn 2013, she published ''The Windsor Caper'' (2013), a children's story that had been hidden away since the 1980s when it was a weekly serial in ''The Buffalo News''; it is now available both as in ebook and paperback form. The book tells a charming story of two little American girls who have a great, night-time adventure in Windsor Castle, England. It features strange dreams, a foiled robbery, and some wonderful heraldic beasties, plus various historical characters including King Henry VIII. Gerda describes it as the only one of her books that is \"not rooted in pain\".  It is written to provide kids with pure enjoyment from start to finish.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n\n=== Presidential Medal of Freedom ===\nOn February 15, 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] presented Gerda Weissmann Klein and 14 other recipients with the 2010 [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. At the ceremony in the East Room of the White House, President Obama announced, \"This year's Medal of Freedom recipients reveal the best of who we are and who we aspire to be.\" He stated the following as Klein was presented with her Presidential Medal of Freedom:\n\n<blockquote>By the time she was 21, Gerda Klein had spent six years living under Nazi rule \u2014 three of them in concentration camps. Her parents and brother had been taken away. Her best friend had died in her arms during a 350-mile death march. And she weighed only 68 pounds when she was found by American forces in an abandoned bicycle factory. But Gerda survived. She married the soldier who rescued her. And ever since \u2014 as an author, a historian and a crusader for tolerance \u2014 she has taught the world that it is often in our most hopeless moments that we discover the extent of our strength and the depth of our love.</blockquote>\n\nPresident Obama then read a statement from Klein: \"I pray you never stand at any crossroads in your own lives, but if you do, if the darkness seems so total, if you think there is no way out, remember, never ever give up.\"<ref>White House Press Office, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/02/15/remarks-president-honoring-recipients-2010-medal-freedom Remarks by the President Honoring the Recipients of the 2010 Medal of Freedom], February 15, 2011.

She has spoken to school children in each of the 50 United States and the District of Columbia and has traveled the world to spread her message of tolerance and hope, meeting with world leaders, including [[Golda Meir]] and [[Menachem Begin]], as well as [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and U.S. Presidents [[Harry Truman]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[George W. Bush]]. In 1996, Klein was one of five women to receive the prestigious international Lion of Judah award in Jerusalem. She has also been featured on the cover of the McDougal-Littell high school textbook, ''The Americans'', with such other notable figures as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.|General Norman Schwarzkopf]]. She received an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters from [[Daemen College]] in 1975. \n\nIn 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed her to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]'s Governing Council. In 2007, the museum bestowed Klein with its highest honor at The Arizona Biltmore before 1,000 guests.\n\nIn May 2001, [[Chapman University]] awarded Kurt Klein and Gerda Weissmann Klein an honorary doctorate of humane letters, the only married couple to be so honored by the university. Klein has spoken at Chapman University several times, most recently in November 2011.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2008, Klein co-founded [[Citizenship Counts]], a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to educate students on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, inspire their pride in America, and encourage them to participate in community service, with her granddaughter, Alysa Cooper. Citizenship Counts empowers young people to be responsible, participatory, and socially just citizens who appreciate the benefits of living in a diverse, inclusive, democratic country. Its multi-disciplinary core curriculum provides middle and high students across the country a unique opportunity to plan for and host a community-based naturalization ceremony in their school setting. The vision of Citizenship Counts is to create a well-informed, responsible citizenry of individuals who are motivated to participate in both local and national community service. Klein's wish is that this organization will give her an opportunity to give back and thank the United States of America for all that she has been given over the years since she became a naturalized citizen in 1948. She expressed her passion for the mission of Citizenship Counts:\n\n{{quote|America is a unique, diverse and wondrous country, comprised both of those who know its magnificence as their birthright, and others, like me, who are privileged to call our adopted country 'our own.'  What we all share is a desire for our families to enjoy America's boundless opportunities while extending to all our fellow citizens justice and the blessings and freedoms upon which the nation was founded.\n\nTo perpetuate the miracle that is America we must teach our children about its rich history as a nation of immigrants who chose this country and have given meaning to its ideals.\n\nCitizenship Counts will engage today's students in civics education, combined with active participation in a naturalization ceremony, to help ensure that the citizens of tomorrow will continue to foster tolerance, understanding, service to one another and a greater appreciation for the privilege and responsibility of citizenship.}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* 1957: ''All But My Life''.

Her autobiographical account of the Holocaust, ''All but My Life'' (1957), was adapted for the 1995 short film, ''[[One Survivor Remembers]]'', which received an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)|Academy Award]] and an [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]], and was selected for the [[National Film Registry]]. She married Kurt Klein (1920\u20132002) in 1946. The Kleins became advocates of Holocaust education and human rights, dedicating most of their lives to promoting tolerance and community service. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Gerda Weissmann Klein also founded [[Citizenship Counts]], a nonprofit organization that champions the value and responsibilities of American citizenship. She has served on the governing board of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], which features her testimony in a permanent exhibit. On February 15, 2011, Klein was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2013, she published a children's adventure story called ''The Windsor Caper'', which had remained hidden away since the 1980s, when it was a weekly serial in ''The Buffalo News''.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1924 in [[Bielsko]] (now [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]]), [[Poland]], a town known for its textile industry, Gerda Weissmann was educated first in public school and then in a Catholic school for girls. She was one of two children born to a middle-class Jewish family;<ref name=\"ushmm\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/phistories/phi_individuals_kurt_gerda_klein_uu.htm Personal Histories: Gerda Weissmann Klein and Kurt Klein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805083152/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/phistories/phi_individuals_kurt_gerda_klein_uu.htm |date=2006-08-05 }}, [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].

Shortly after the invasion began, the family received a telegram from Gerda's uncle saying that the Germans were advancing quickly, and the family should leave Poland immediately. However, Gerda's father had just suffered a heart attack, and doctors advised that he not be moved or subjected to undue stress.\n\nAfter the invasion, Gerda and her family watched in disbelief as people, ethnic Germans living in Poland, whom they had considered friends began flying the Nazi flag and using the Hitler salute. In mid-October, Gerda's older brother Arthur received a letter from the Germans:  as a male between 16 and 50, Arthur (19) was required to register for the army. On October 18, 1939, Arthur complied with the summons and never saw his family again.\n\nGerda and her parents were forced to live in the basement of their home and later in a Jewish [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939 - 1944|ghetto]]. In 1942, Gerda was separated from her father, who was sent to a death camp where he eventually perished that April. In June, her time in the ghetto was over. Left with only the company of her mother, they approached the guard; her mother was sent right, she went left. As Gerda and her mother boarded separate trucks, Gerda leapt out, pleading not to be separated from her sole remaining family member. Moshe Merin, head of the Jewish Community Council, tossed her back inside saying, \"You are too young to die.\" He had saved her life, yet sentenced her mother to death. She was sent to the Dulag (Durchgangslager). She was in several camps throughout the war.  First, she was in Bolkenhain working on the looms (July 1942-August 1943). Gerda was then transferred to M\u00e0rzdorf working physical labor (August 1943-?). She was quickly moved to Landeshut, thanks to the help of several people from Bolkenhain. In Landenshut, she was working the looms once again.  The Germans were losing the war, and Landenshut was shut down (?-May 1944). The last camp Gerda was in was Gr\u00fcnberg.  Gerda was once again working the looms, but it was very different from her former camps. Bolkenhain and Landenshut were both better than other camps, and the girls were treated (somewhat) fairly at those two camps.  Marzdorf was very bad. Gerda almost died from being overworked, but her childhood friend, Ilse, helped get Gerda out. Gr\u00fcnberg was very different. The director was very violent and very often beat the prisoners. The girls who worked outside managed to stay healthy, but the girls who worked on the looms died quickly due to the bad conditions (May 1944-January 1945). Gerda was among 4000 women who began the 350-mile [[death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] to avoid the advance of the Allied forces. During the death march, Gerda's best friend Ilse told her that she would be all alone now. They fell asleep with Gerda holding Ilse, and when she awoke, her friend had died in her sleep.\n\nThe forced journey went through Dresden, Chemnitz, Zwickau, Reichenbach, Plauen, Germany, and on through [[Volary|Wallern]] (now Volary in modern-day [[Czech Republic]]), and she was one of fewer than 120 women who survived exposure to the winter elements, starvation, and arbitrary execution. Despite such atrocities, Gerda never lost the will to live except for a brief time when she planned to jump in front of a train and end it all, but remembered her father telling her to never consider suicide. She also attributed her survival to the fact that her father had told her to wear her ski boots when it came time to leave the home. The boots proved to be invaluable during the 3 month march in the snow.\n\nHer friends Ilse Kleinzahler, Liesl Steppe and Suse Kunz are buried in a cemetery in Wallern, Czech republic along with 92 others who died along the way.\n\n==Liberation==\nIn May 1945, Gerda was liberated by forces of the [[United States Army]] in [[Volary]], Czechoslovakia;<ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/volary_death_march/index.asp Gerda Weissmann Klein's] testimony at \"THE DEATH MARCH TO VOLARY\" - an exhibition at [[Yad Vashem]] website</ref> these forces included Lieutenant Kurt Klein,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20061207 |title=Voices on Antisemitisim interview with Gerda Weissmann Klein |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=2006-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622194533/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20061207 |archivedate=2007-06-22 }}</ref> who was born in Germany and immigrated to the [[United States]] to escape Nazism as a teenager in 1937. Both of his parents had been killed by the Nazis at Auschwitz. When Gerda and Kurt first met, Weissmann was white-haired, weighed 68 pounds, and was one day shy of her 21st birthday. She was wearing rags, and had not bathed in three years. Kurt simply opened a door for her, and she immediately felt human again. The two became engaged in September 1945 and married in 1946.\n\n==Life after the War==\nGerda and Kurt Klein were married in Paris, France. They settled in [[Kenmore, New York]] and had three children and eight grandchildren. Gerda became involved with several local and national charities and soon began to speak about her experiences during the war.\n\nThe story of Gerda and Kurt's meeting and life together has been featured on numerous television shows, including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]''. A book of their letters, ''The Hours After'', is a poignant collection of correspondence between Gerda and Kurt Klein following the war.\n\nIn 2013, she published ''The Windsor Caper'' (2013), a children's story that had been hidden away since the 1980s when it was a weekly serial in ''The Buffalo News''; it is now available both as in ebook and paperback form. The book tells a charming story of two little American girls who have a great, night-time adventure in Windsor Castle, England. It features strange dreams, a foiled robbery, and some wonderful heraldic beasties, plus various historical characters including King Henry VIII. Gerda describes it as the only one of her books that is \"not rooted in pain\".  It is written to provide kids with pure enjoyment from start to finish.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nOn February 15, 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] presented Gerda Weissmann Klein and 14 other recipients with the 2010 [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. At the ceremony in the East Room of the White House, President Obama announced, \"This year's Medal of Freedom recipients reveal the best of who we are and who we aspire to be.\" He stated the following as Klein was presented with her Presidential Medal of Freedom:\n\n<blockquote>By the time she was 21, Gerda Klein had spent six years living under Nazi rule \u2014 three of them in concentration camps. Her parents and brother had been taken away. Her best friend had died in her arms during a 350-mile death march.

He was the governor of the province of [[P\u00e1nuco (province)|P\u00e1nuco]] from 1525 to 1533 and of [[Nueva Galicia]] from 1529 to 1534, President of the first [[Royal Audiencia of Mexico]] (High Court) from 1528 to 1530. He founded several cities in Northwestern [[Mexico]], including [[Guadalajara]].\n\nOriginally a bodyguard of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]], he was sent to Mexico to counterbalance the influence of the leader of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], since the King worried he was becoming too powerful. As Governor of P\u00e1nuco, Guzm\u00e1n cracked down hard on the supporters of Cort\u00e9s, stripping him and his supporters of property and rights. He conducted numerous expeditions of conquest into the northwestern areas of Mexico, enslaving thousands of Indians and shipping them to the Caribbean colonies. In the resulting power struggles where he also made himself an enemy of important churchmen, Guzm\u00e1n came out the loser.\n\nIn 1537, he was arrested for treason, abuse of power and mistreatment of the indigenous inhabitants of his territories, and he was sent to Spain in shackles. His subsequent reputation, in scholarship and popular discourse, has been that of a cruel, violent and irrational tyrant. His legacy has partly been colored by the fact that history was written largely by his political opponents such as [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]] and [[Vasco de Quiroga]].\n\n==Early life==\nNu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n was born ca. 1485 in [[Guadalajara, Spain]], to an old noble family. His father was Hern\u00e1n Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n, a wealthy merchant and a High Constable in the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; his mother was Do\u00f1a Magdalena de Guzm\u00e1n.<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia. ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1991, p. 170.</ref> The Guzm\u00e1n family supported Prince Charles in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] and achieved gratitude of the later Emperor.  Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n received some experience in law, but never finished a degree.<ref>Chipman 1967: 59 -65</ref> For a period he and his younger brother served as one of 100 royal bodyguards of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]], and he accompanied the Emperor on a trip to Flanders in 1522, and undertook sensitive diplomatic missions, including one dealing with the Bishop of Cuenca (Spain).<ref>Himmerich y Valencia, ''Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170.</ref>\n\n== Governorship of P\u00e1nuco ==\nIn 1525 the Spanish crown appointed him governor of the autonomous territory of P\u00e1nuco on the Gulf Coast in what is now northeast Mexico, arriving to take up the appointment in May 1527.<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170.</ref> He traveled with [[Luis Ponce de Le\u00f3n (governor of New Spain)|Lu\u00eds Ponce de Leon]] and arrived in [[Hispaniola]] in 1526, but here he fell sick and did not arrive in Mexico until May 1527, immediately assuming his post.<ref>Krippner-Martinez 2001:50</ref><ref>The discrepancy between the dates of arrival in various sources is resolved by Chipman 1967:143-144</ref> Cort\u00e9s had already extended his reach into P\u00e1nuco, so that Guzm\u00e1n's appointment was a direct challenge. His appointment was opposed by the Pro-[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Cort\u00e9s]] faction of the struggle for power in early colonial Mexico, who viewed him as an outsider with no military experience.<ref>Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170.</ref> But he had the support of the [[Council of Indies]] and the Spanish Crown who saw him as a counterbalance to the figure of Cort\u00e9s whose aspirations to power worried the King of Spain. Guzm\u00e1n's appointment gave heart to Spanish conquerors who had not received what they considered sufficient rewards from Cort\u00e9s's distribution of [[encomienda]]s and to Spanish settlers who had not participated in the conquest but saw their paths to position and wealth blocked by the Cort\u00e9s faction.<ref>Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170</ref>\n\nGuzm\u00e1n's rule as a governor of P\u00e1nuco was stern against Spanish rivals and brutal against the Indians. He stroke down harshly against Cort\u00e9s's supporters in P\u00e1nuco, accusing some of them of disloyalty to the Crown by backing Cort\u00e9s's claim to the title of viceroy. Some were stripped of their property; others were tried and executed. He also incorporated territory from adjacent provinces into the province of P\u00e1nuco. These actions brought New Spain on the verge of a civil war between Guzm\u00e1n and supporters of Cort\u00e9s' led by Governor of New Spain [[Alonso de Estrada]], when Estrada sent an expedition to reclaim the lands expropriated by Guzm\u00e1n. During the court case against Cort\u00e9s in 1529, Guzm\u00e1n accused Cort\u00e9s himself of being a traitor and a rebel. Bishop [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], who had traveled with Guzm\u00e1n to Hispaniola, in turn accused Guzm\u00e1n of being allied with the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and having been a sworn enemy of Cort\u00e9s even before setting foot in New Spain.<ref>Chipman 1967:149-54</ref>\n\nAs governor Guzm\u00e1n instituted a system of Indian slave trade in P\u00e1nuco. During a raid along R\u00edo de Las Palmas in 1528 he allowed every horseman to take 20 Indian slaves and each footman 15. In 1529 he gave out individual slaving permissions amounting to more than 1000 slaves. Initially Guzm\u00e1n did not allow Spaniards to sell slaves for export except in exchange for livestock, but later he gave more than 1500 slave licenses (each permitting the taking of between 15 and 50 slaves) in an eight-month period.<ref>Chipman 1967:225</ref> The slaving operation in P\u00e1nuco expanded when Guzm\u00e1n became President of the [[Royal Audiencia of Mexico]] and he had Indian slaves smuggled into P\u00e1nuco and shipped on to the Caribbean.<ref>Chipman 1967:225</ref> Indian slaves were branded on the face. Taking Indian slaves was not explicitly outlawed in the period before 1528. Beginning in 1528, Indian slaving operations came under increased royal control but were not prohibited. The regulations of September 19, 1528, required slave owners to present proof of the legality of the taking of any slaves before branding. In 1529 the Crown began an investigation into the slaving enterprises of Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nIn spite of his lack of success as governor, in 1529 he was appointed President of the First Audiencia, which the Council of the Indies and the Crown instated to check the ventures of industrious private individuals, such as Cort\u00e9s, in New Spain.\n\n==As President of the Real Audiencia==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn the years following the conquest of Central Mexico by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], New Spain had been governed by a [[Stratocracy|military government]], generally with the objectives of maximizing personal economic gains by the Spanish conquistadors. Hoping to establish a more orderly government, to reduce the authority of Cort\u00e9s, and secure the authority of the Spanish crown in the New World, on December 13, 1527 the metropolitan government of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in [[Burgos]] named the ''[[Real Audiencia de M\u00e9xico]]'' to take over the government of the colony. This Audiencia consisted of a president and four ''[[oidores]]'' (judges). Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n was named president. His oidores were [[Juan Ortiz de Matienzo]], [[Diego Delgadillo]], Diego Maldonado and Alonso de Parada; these two last fell sick during the voyage to New Spain and died shortly after arrival.\n\nAt the time Guzm\u00e1n was serving as governor of P\u00e1nuco, so Charles ordered the judges to assemble in [[Veracruz]] and from there make a joint entrance into the capital. The four from Spain, however, did not wait for the arrival of Guzm\u00e1n, and proceeded directly to the capital. They arrived on December 8, 1528, taking over the government on the following day. They were given a splendid reception by the city government. Guzm\u00e1n arrived a few days after the others.\n\nThe first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|bishop of Mexico]], [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], had arrived in the capital only a few days before the oidores.\n\nThe instructions given to the Audiencia included a recommendation for good treatment of the indigenous people and a directive that the investigation into the conduct of Cort\u00e9s and his associates [[Pedro de Alvarado]], [[Alonso de Estrada]], [[Rodrigo de Albornoz]], [[Gonzalo de Salazar]] and [[Pedro Alm\u00edndez Chirino]] be concluded within 90 days. Most of these associates had participated in the government in the proceeding few years while Cort\u00e9s was in Honduras, with a lot of in-fighting among themselves and injustices to the population, both Spanish and Indigenous.\n\nCort\u00e9s himself was now in Spain, where he was defending his conduct and appealing his loss of authority to Charles.  Cort\u00e9s had some success with his appeal, being named Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca and receiving some other honors.\n\nNevertheless, Guzm\u00e1n was now in charge in New Spain. Among his official acts was placing plaques bearing the royal coat of arms on the principal buildings of the capital, to stress that sovereignty resided in the king, not in Cort\u00e9s. He had Pedro de Alvarado arrested for questioning the loyalty of Gonzalo de Salazar. There was already some animosity between Cort\u00e9s and Guzm\u00e1n, because the former had been reluctant to recognize the latter as governor of P\u00e1nuco. The later events made the two enemies.\n\nThe Audiencia also banned direct communication with the court in Spain. This was so effective that Bishop Zum\u00e1rraga felt the necessity of hiding a letter sealed in wax in a cask, to be smuggled to the Spanish authorities by a confederate sailor.\n\nIn 1530, upon Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s' return to New Spain, Guzm\u00e1n was removed from the office of President of the Audiencia and instead appointed governor of [[Nueva Galicia]]. As governor of Nueva Galicia he continued his politics of violent submission of the Indians of the [[Gran Chichimeca]] and came into conflict with church authorities such as [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], the Bishop appointed as Protector of the Indians, and Bishop of Michoac\u00e1n [[Vasco de Quiroga]]. He also founded several cities that still exist such as [[Zacatecas]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]] and [[Guadalajara]]. In 1531 Zum\u00e1rraga published a treaty decrying Guzm\u00e1n's 1529 campaign as unjust. Guzm\u00e1n, who had by then made many enemies, fell out of favor with the authorities and the Second Audiencia. In 1533 he was removed from the Governorship of P\u00e1nuco and in 1534 of that of Nueva Galicia. In 1537 he was charged with treason, jailed and later expelled from New Spain.<ref>Rojinsky 2010:236</ref>\n\n==As conqueror of western Mexico==\nIn 1529, Guzm\u00e1n put [[Juan Ortiz de Matienzo]] in charge of the Audiencia. Then, gathering a military force of 300 to 400 discontented conquistadors and between 5,000 and 8,000 indigenous Nahua allies, Guzm\u00e1n set out on December 21, 1529, to the west of Mexico City to conquer lands and peoples who until then had resisted the conquest.<ref>Krippner-Martinez 2001:56</ref> Among the officers on this expedition was [[Pedro Alm\u00edndez Chirino]].\n\nThe campaign started with the torture and execution of the [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Pur\u00e9pecha]] ''[[cazonci]]'' [[Tang\u00e1xuan II]], a powerful indigenous ally of the Spanish Crown. Guzm\u00e1n proceeded to launch a fierce campaign into the [[Chichimec]] lands in the province that was to become known as [[Nueva Galicia]], reaching as far as [[Culiac\u00e1n]]. Part of the purpose of the expedition was to find the fabled [[Zuni-Cibola Complex|Cibola]], the [[Seven Cities of Gold]].<ref>Krippner-Martinez 2001:99</ref>\n\nThis expedition has been described as a \"genocidal enterprise\".<ref>David E. Stannard, ''American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 1993, p. 81.</ref> Typically, the conquistadors attacked an Indian village, stole the [[maize]] and other food, razed and burned the dwellings, and tortured the native leaders to gather information on what riches could be stolen there, or from nearby populations. For the most part, these riches did not exist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nAs an example, the Spanish were received peaceably in [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] by [[Tang\u00e1xuan II]], the ''cazonci'' of the [[Tarascan state]], which largely coincides with the modern state of [[Michoac\u00e1n]]. Tang\u00e1xuan gave Guzm\u00e1n presents of gold and silver and supplied him with soldiers and provisions. Nevertheless, Guzm\u00e1n had him arrested and tortured, to get him to reveal the location of hidden stores of gold. Presumably there was no more gold, because Tang\u00e1xuan did not reveal it under torture. Guzm\u00e1n had him dragged by a horse and then burned alive on February 14, 1530.<ref name=\"Krippner-Mart\u00ednez2010\">{{cite book|author=James Krippner-Mart\u00ednez|title=Rereading the Conquest: Power, Politics, and the History of Early Colonial Michoac\u2021n, Mexico, 1521-1565|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32hlcJw3iTgC|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-03940-X|page=55}}</ref><ref name=\"Ver\u00e1stique2010\">{{cite book|author=Bernardino Ver\u00e1stique|title=Michoac\u00e1n and Eden: Vasco de Quiroga and the Evangelization of Western Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q3UAAAAQBAJ|date=1 January 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-77380-6|page=124}}</ref><ref name=\"Marley2008\">{{cite book|author=David Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-100-8|page=43}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in Mexico City, the actions of the Audiencia attracted the attention of Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, bishop of Mexico, who put it under an ecclesiastical interdiction on March 7, 1530. The immediate cause of the interdiction was a case of violation of sanctuary. The Audiencia had violently taken from the convent of San Francisco a servant of Cort\u00e9s accused of grave crimes, and two religious, Crist\u00f3bal de Angulo and Garc\u00eda de Llerena.\n\nUndeterred, Guzm\u00e1n continued the violent suppression on the peoples of the present-day states of [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Nayarit]] and [[Sinaloa]]. In the latter state, he founded the city of [[Culiac\u00e1n|San Miguel de Culiac\u00e1n]] on September 29, 1531. He returned to [[Tepic]], where he set up his headquarters, sending out new expeditions from there. One of these founded the cities of [[Compostela, Nayarit|Santiago de Galicia de Compostela and Purificaci\u00f3n]]. Another traveled as far as the current Mexican state of [[Sonora]]. His violent expeditions into Chichimec lands were a main cause of the [[Mixt\u00f3n rebellion]].\n\n==Foundation of Guadalajara in New Spain==\nIn 1531 (probably January), one of Guzm\u00e1n's captains, [[Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate]], founded a small town near Nochistl\u00e1n to which the name \"[[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]]\" was given. Two years later Guzm\u00e1n visited the city, and at the request of its inhabitants, who were fearful of Indian attacks and lacked sufficient water, he ordered it moved to [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]]. This occurred on May 24, 1533. Later, after Guzm\u00e1n had returned to Spain, it was moved again, to a site near [[Tlacotan]] (northeast of modern [[Zapopan]]). This occurred probably between October 1541 and February of the following year. Later the settlers began to complain to [[Antonio de Mendoza]], then the [[viceroy]] of New Spain, about both the repeated relocations and Guzm\u00e1n's cruelty.\n\n==Kingdom of New Galicia==\nNu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n gave the name \"Conquista del Esp\u00edritu Santo de la Mayor Espa\u00f1a\" to the territories he explored and conquered. However, the queen of Spain, [[Joanna of Castile]], mother of Charles V, did not approve of the name. By a royal decree dated January 25, 1531, she supplied the name ''Reino de [[Nueva Galicia]]'' (Kingdom of New Galicia).\n\nThis territory extended from the [[Rio Lerma]] to Sonora, with its capital at [[Compostela, Nayarit|Compostela]]. New Galicia was a separate entity, not under the authority of the Audiencia of Mexico City (but still part of New Spain).\n\nOne nineteenth-century chronicler of the Conquest referred to Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n as \"the detestable governor of P\u00e1nuco and perhaps the most depraved man ever to set foot in New Spain.\"<ref>[[Vicente Riva Palacio]]. ''M\u00e9xico a trav\u00e9s de los siglos'', Vol. II, (Barcelona: Espasa, 1991 [1880]) {{ISBN|978-84-7764-516-0}} cited in Dijes Ant\u00f3n, Juan and Manuel Sagredo y Mart\u00edn. ''Biograf\u00edas de hijos ilustres de la Provincia de Guadalajara''. (Guadalajara, Spain, 1889), 45. Keep in mind that Dijes and Sagredo write, \"It truly jumps to our attention that Riva Palacio starts, as soon as he commences his account of Nu\u00f1o, to use at every step a unique language, applying to him the harshest expressions in the Castilian tongue, language not used with any other, which leaves him open to our attempt to refute him.\" (43) They point out that the other chroniclers of the period\u2014among them [[Bernal D\u00edaz]] and [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] mention very little about Guzm\u00e1n, and what they say is positive. They conclude that Rivas Palacio could have made use of the unpublished sources of the [[Archivo General de Indias|Archives of the Indies]] to come up with his different account.</ref> Fray [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] called him a \"great tyrant\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Final years in Spain==\nReports of Guzm\u00e1n's treatment of the Indigenous had reached Mexico City and Spain, and, at Bishop Zum\u00e1rraga's request the Crown sent [[Diego P\u00e9rez de la Torre]] to investigate. Guzm\u00e1n was arrested in 1536. He was held a prisoner for more than a year and then sent to Spain in fetters. He was released from the [[:es: Castillo de Torrej\u00f3n de Velasco|Castle of Torrej\u00f3n prison]] in 1538. In 1539 he returned to his position as royal ''contino'' bodyguard - court records show him on the payroll every year from 1539 to 1561 (in 1561 as \"deceased\"). In 1552 he wrote up a ''memorial'' containing his own version of the events leading to his fall. In his account he justified his execution of the Pur\u00e9pecha Cazonci as being necessary in order to bring a Christian rule of law to the area, and he assured that: \"in truth no execution more just has been carried out in all of New Spain, and if I were deserving of any punishment it would be for having doubted some days about whether to carry it out.\"<ref>Rojinsky 2010:238 (translated from the Spanish: \"cierto ninguna se ha hecho m\u00e1s justa en toda la Nueva Espa\u00f1a; y si yo alguna pena podia merecer es porque dud\u00e9 algunos d\u00edas de hacerla\"\")</ref>\n\nIn 1558 he wrote his last will which was uncovered in 1973, it shows him as a poverty stricken noble struggling to save his heirs from his debts, having had even to pawn his heirlooms to pay for medicine. In it, he requested some of the property that was confiscated from him to be returned to his heirs, and wages still due to him for his years as Governor and President be paid and turned over to his heirs. With affection he bequeathed most of his belongings to a woman Sabina de Guzm\u00e1n, who had taken care of him in his illness. He also bequeathed belongings to the [[Franciscan Order]], in spite of the conflicts he had had with its members in New Spain.<ref>Chipman 1978</ref> He probably died in Valladolid in 1558 on October 16 or shortly thereafter.<ref>Chipman 1967:280-81</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\nIn posteriority and partly in his own time Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n achieved a reputation as the worst villain of the conquistadors, in the words of his biographer Donald Chipman he has been depicted as the \"personification of the [[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]\".<ref>Chipman 1967:141</ref> His contemporary [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], one of Cort\u00e9s' loyal supporters, described him in the following terms: \"... In all the provinces of New Spain there was not another man more foul and evil than [Guzm\u00e1n] of P\u00e1nuco\".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} His biographer Santana describes his personality as characterized by \"cruelty of the highest order, ambition without limit, a refined hypocrisy, great immorality, ingratitude without equal, and a fierce hatred for Cort\u00e9s\".<ref>Chipman 1967:142-43</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--If indent param. is used,  Pls use a colon (:) instead of asterisk (*) for bullet markers in the references list -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n: {{cite book|author=Chipman, Donald E.  |title=Nuno de Guzman and the Province of Panuco in New Spain, 1518&ndash;1533|location= Glendale, California|publisher=Arthur H.

He was the governor of the province of [[P\u00e1nuco (province)|P\u00e1nuco]] from 1525 to 1533 and of [[Nueva Galicia]] from 1529 to 1534, President of the first [[Royal Audiencia of Mexico]] (High Court) from 1528 to 1530. He founded several cities in Northwestern [[Mexico]], including [[Guadalajara]].\n\nOriginally a bodyguard of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Spain]], he was sent to Mexico to counterbalance the influence of the leader of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], since the King worried he was becoming too powerful. As Governor of P\u00e1nuco, Guzm\u00e1n cracked down hard on the supporters of Cort\u00e9s, stripping him and his supporters of property and rights. He conducted numerous expeditions of conquest into the northwestern areas of Mexico, enslaving thousands of Indians and shipping them to the Caribbean colonies. In the resulting power struggles where he also made himself an enemy of important churchmen, Guzm\u00e1n came out the loser.\n\nIn 1537, he was arrested for treason, abuse of power and mistreatment of the indigenous inhabitants of his territories, and he was sent to Spain in shackles. His subsequent reputation, in scholarship and popular discourse, has been that of a cruel, violent and irrational tyrant. His legacy has partly been colored by the fact that history was written largely by his political opponents such as [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]] and [[Vasco de Quiroga]].\n\n==Early life==\nNu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n was born ca. 1485 in [[Guadalajara, Spain]], to an old noble family. His father was Hern\u00e1n Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n, a wealthy merchant and a High Constable in the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; his mother was Do\u00f1a Magdalena de Guzm\u00e1n.<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia. ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1991, p. 170.</ref> The Guzm\u00e1n family supported Prince Charles in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] and achieved gratitude of the later Emperor.  Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n received some experience in law, but never finished a degree.<ref>Chipman 1967: 59 -65</ref> For a period he and his younger brother served as one of 100 royal bodyguards of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]], and he accompanied the Emperor on a trip to Flanders in 1522, and undertook sensitive diplomatic missions, including one dealing with the Bishop of Cuenca (Spain).<ref>Himmerich y Valencia, ''Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170.</ref>\n\n== Governorship of P\u00e1nuco ==\nIn 1525 the Spanish crown appointed him governor of the autonomous territory of P\u00e1nuco on the Gulf Coast in what is now northeast Mexico, arriving to take up the appointment in May 1527.<ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170.</ref> He traveled with [[Luis Ponce de Le\u00f3n (governor of New Spain)|Lu\u00eds Ponce de Leon]] and arrived in [[Hispaniola]] in 1526, but here he fell sick and did not arrive in Mexico until May 1527, immediately assuming his post.<ref>Krippner-Martinez 2001:50</ref><ref>The discrepancy between the dates of arrival in various sources is resolved by Chipman 1967:143-144</ref> Cort\u00e9s had already extended his reach into P\u00e1nuco, so that Guzm\u00e1n's appointment was a direct challenge. His appointment was opposed by the Pro-[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Cort\u00e9s]] faction of the struggle for power in early colonial Mexico, who viewed him as an outsider with no military experience.<ref>Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170.</ref> But he had the support of the [[Council of Indies]] and the Spanish Crown who saw him as a counterbalance to the figure of Cort\u00e9s whose aspirations to power worried the King of Spain. Guzm\u00e1n's appointment gave heart to Spanish conquerors who had not received what they considered sufficient rewards from Cort\u00e9s's distribution of [[encomienda]]s and to Spanish settlers who had not participated in the conquest but saw their paths to position and wealth blocked by the Cort\u00e9s faction.<ref>Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain'', p. 170</ref>\n\nGuzm\u00e1n's rule as a governor of P\u00e1nuco was stern against Spanish rivals and brutal against the Indians. He stroke down harshly against Cort\u00e9s's supporters in P\u00e1nuco, accusing some of them of disloyalty to the Crown by backing Cort\u00e9s's claim to the title of viceroy. Some were stripped of their property; others were tried and executed. He also incorporated territory from adjacent provinces into the province of P\u00e1nuco. These actions brought New Spain on the verge of a civil war between Guzm\u00e1n and supporters of Cort\u00e9s' led by Governor of New Spain [[Alonso de Estrada]], when Estrada sent an expedition to reclaim the lands expropriated by Guzm\u00e1n. During the court case against Cort\u00e9s in 1529, Guzm\u00e1n accused Cort\u00e9s himself of being a traitor and a rebel. Bishop [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], who had traveled with Guzm\u00e1n to Hispaniola, in turn accused Guzm\u00e1n of being allied with the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and having been a sworn enemy of Cort\u00e9s even before setting foot in New Spain.<ref>Chipman 1967:149-54</ref>\n\nAs governor Guzm\u00e1n instituted a system of Indian slave trade in P\u00e1nuco. During a raid along R\u00edo de Las Palmas in 1528 he allowed every horseman to take 20 Indian slaves and each footman 15. In 1529 he gave out individual slaving permissions amounting to more than 1000 slaves. Initially Guzm\u00e1n did not allow Spaniards to sell slaves for export except in exchange for livestock, but later he gave more than 1500 slave licenses (each permitting the taking of between 15 and 50 slaves) in an eight-month period.<ref>Chipman 1967:225</ref> The slaving operation in P\u00e1nuco expanded when Guzm\u00e1n became President of the [[Royal Audiencia of Mexico]] and he had Indian slaves smuggled into P\u00e1nuco and shipped on to the Caribbean.<ref>Chipman 1967:225</ref> Indian slaves were branded on the face. Taking Indian slaves was not explicitly outlawed in the period before 1528. Beginning in 1528, Indian slaving operations came under increased royal control but were not prohibited. The regulations of September 19, 1528, required slave owners to present proof of the legality of the taking of any slaves before branding. In 1529 the Crown began an investigation into the slaving enterprises of Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nIn spite of his lack of success as governor, in 1529 he was appointed President of the First Audiencia, which the Council of the Indies and the Crown instated to check the ventures of industrious private individuals, such as Cort\u00e9s, in New Spain.\n\n==As President of the Real Audiencia==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn the years following the conquest of Central Mexico by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], New Spain had been governed by a [[Stratocracy|military government]], generally with the objectives of maximizing personal economic gains by the Spanish conquistadors. Hoping to establish a more orderly government, to reduce the authority of Cort\u00e9s, and secure the authority of the Spanish crown in the New World, on December 13, 1527 the metropolitan government of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in [[Burgos]] named the ''[[Real Audiencia de M\u00e9xico]]'' to take over the government of the colony. This Audiencia consisted of a president and four ''[[oidores]]'' (judges). Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n was named president. His oidores were [[Juan Ortiz de Matienzo]], [[Diego Delgadillo]], Diego Maldonado and Alonso de Parada; these two last fell sick during the voyage to New Spain and died shortly after arrival.\n\nAt the time Guzm\u00e1n was serving as governor of P\u00e1nuco, so Charles ordered the judges to assemble in [[Veracruz]] and from there make a joint entrance into the capital. The four from Spain, however, did not wait for the arrival of Guzm\u00e1n, and proceeded directly to the capital. They arrived on December 8, 1528, taking over the government on the following day. They were given a splendid reception by the city government. Guzm\u00e1n arrived a few days after the others.\n\nThe first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|bishop of Mexico]], [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], had arrived in the capital only a few days before the oidores.\n\nThe instructions given to the Audiencia included a recommendation for good treatment of the indigenous people and a directive that the investigation into the conduct of Cort\u00e9s and his associates [[Pedro de Alvarado]], [[Alonso de Estrada]], [[Rodrigo de Albornoz]], [[Gonzalo de Salazar]] and [[Pedro Alm\u00edndez Chirino]] be concluded within 90 days. Most of these associates had participated in the government in the proceeding few years while Cort\u00e9s was in Honduras, with a lot of in-fighting among themselves and injustices to the population, both Spanish and Indigenous.\n\nCort\u00e9s himself was now in Spain, where he was defending his conduct and appealing his loss of authority to Charles.  Cort\u00e9s had some success with his appeal, being named Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca and receiving some other honors.\n\nNevertheless, Guzm\u00e1n was now in charge in New Spain. Among his official acts was placing plaques bearing the royal coat of arms on the principal buildings of the capital, to stress that sovereignty resided in the king, not in Cort\u00e9s. He had Pedro de Alvarado arrested for questioning the loyalty of Gonzalo de Salazar. There was already some animosity between Cort\u00e9s and Guzm\u00e1n, because the former had been reluctant to recognize the latter as governor of P\u00e1nuco. The later events made the two enemies.\n\nThe Audiencia also banned direct communication with the court in Spain. This was so effective that Bishop Zum\u00e1rraga felt the necessity of hiding a letter sealed in wax in a cask, to be smuggled to the Spanish authorities by a confederate sailor.\n\nIn 1530, upon Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s' return to New Spain, Guzm\u00e1n was removed from the office of President of the Audiencia and instead appointed governor of [[Nueva Galicia]]. As governor of Nueva Galicia he continued his politics of violent submission of the Indians of the [[Gran Chichimeca]] and came into conflict with church authorities such as [[Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga]], the Bishop appointed as Protector of the Indians, and Bishop of Michoac\u00e1n [[Vasco de Quiroga]]. He also founded several cities that still exist such as [[Zacatecas]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]] and [[Guadalajara]]. In 1531 Zum\u00e1rraga published a treaty decrying Guzm\u00e1n's 1529 campaign as unjust. Guzm\u00e1n, who had by then made many enemies, fell out of favor with the authorities and the Second Audiencia. In 1533 he was removed from the Governorship of P\u00e1nuco and in 1534 of that of Nueva Galicia. In 1537 he was charged with treason, jailed and later expelled from New Spain.<ref>Rojinsky 2010:236</ref>\n\n==As conqueror of western Mexico==\nIn 1529, Guzm\u00e1n put [[Juan Ortiz de Matienzo]] in charge of the Audiencia. Then, gathering a military force of 300 to 400 discontented conquistadors and between 5,000 and 8,000 indigenous Nahua allies, Guzm\u00e1n set out on December 21, 1529, to the west of Mexico City to conquer lands and peoples who until then had resisted the conquest.<ref>Krippner-Martinez 2001:56</ref> Among the officers on this expedition was [[Pedro Alm\u00edndez Chirino]].\n\nThe campaign started with the torture and execution of the [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Pur\u00e9pecha]] ''[[cazonci]]'' [[Tang\u00e1xuan II]], a powerful indigenous ally of the Spanish Crown. Guzm\u00e1n proceeded to launch a fierce campaign into the [[Chichimec]] lands in the province that was to become known as [[Nueva Galicia]], reaching as far as [[Culiac\u00e1n]]. Part of the purpose of the expedition was to find the fabled [[Zuni-Cibola Complex|Cibola]], the [[Seven Cities of Gold]].<ref>Krippner-Martinez 2001:99</ref>\n\nThis expedition has been described as a \"genocidal enterprise\".<ref>David E. Stannard, ''American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World'', New York: Oxford University Press US, 1993, p. 81.</ref> Typically, the conquistadors attacked an Indian village, stole the [[maize]] and other food, razed and burned the dwellings, and tortured the native leaders to gather information on what riches could be stolen there, or from nearby populations. For the most part, these riches did not exist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nAs an example, the Spanish were received peaceably in [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] by [[Tang\u00e1xuan II]], the ''cazonci'' of the [[Tarascan state]], which largely coincides with the modern state of [[Michoac\u00e1n]]. Tang\u00e1xuan gave Guzm\u00e1n presents of gold and silver and supplied him with soldiers and provisions. Nevertheless, Guzm\u00e1n had him arrested and tortured, to get him to reveal the location of hidden stores of gold. Presumably there was no more gold, because Tang\u00e1xuan did not reveal it under torture. Guzm\u00e1n had him dragged by a horse and then burned alive on February 14, 1530.<ref name=\"Krippner-Mart\u00ednez2010\">{{cite book|author=James Krippner-Mart\u00ednez|title=Rereading the Conquest: Power, Politics, and the History of Early Colonial Michoac\u2021n, Mexico, 1521-1565|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32hlcJw3iTgC|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-03940-X|page=55}}</ref><ref name=\"Ver\u00e1stique2010\">{{cite book|author=Bernardino Ver\u00e1stique|title=Michoac\u00e1n and Eden: Vasco de Quiroga and the Evangelization of Western Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q3UAAAAQBAJ|date=1 January 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-77380-6|page=124}}</ref><ref name=\"Marley2008\">{{cite book|author=David Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-100-8|page=43}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in Mexico City, the actions of the Audiencia attracted the attention of Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, bishop of Mexico, who put it under an ecclesiastical interdiction on March 7, 1530. The immediate cause of the interdiction was a case of violation of sanctuary. The Audiencia had violently taken from the convent of San Francisco a servant of Cort\u00e9s accused of grave crimes, and two religious, Crist\u00f3bal de Angulo and Garc\u00eda de Llerena.\n\nUndeterred, Guzm\u00e1n continued the violent suppression on the peoples of the present-day states of [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Nayarit]] and [[Sinaloa]]. In the latter state, he founded the city of [[Culiac\u00e1n|San Miguel de Culiac\u00e1n]] on September 29, 1531. He returned to [[Tepic]], where he set up his headquarters, sending out new expeditions from there. One of these founded the cities of [[Compostela, Nayarit|Santiago de Galicia de Compostela and Purificaci\u00f3n]]. Another traveled as far as the current Mexican state of [[Sonora]]. His violent expeditions into Chichimec lands were a main cause of the [[Mixt\u00f3n rebellion]].\n\n==Foundation of Guadalajara in New Spain==\nIn 1531 (probably January), one of Guzm\u00e1n's captains, [[Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate]], founded a small town near Nochistl\u00e1n to which the name \"[[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]]\" was given. Two years later Guzm\u00e1n visited the city, and at the request of its inhabitants, who were fearful of Indian attacks and lacked sufficient water, he ordered it moved to [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]]. This occurred on May 24, 1533. Later, after Guzm\u00e1n had returned to Spain, it was moved again, to a site near [[Tlacotan]] (northeast of modern [[Zapopan]]). This occurred probably between October 1541 and February of the following year. Later the settlers began to complain to [[Antonio de Mendoza]], then the [[viceroy]] of New Spain, about both the repeated relocations and Guzm\u00e1n's cruelty.\n\n==Kingdom of New Galicia==\nNu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n gave the name \"Conquista del Esp\u00edritu Santo de la Mayor Espa\u00f1a\" to the territories he explored and conquered. However, the queen of Spain, [[Joanna of Castile]], mother of Charles V, did not approve of the name. By a royal decree dated January 25, 1531, she supplied the name ''Reino de [[Nueva Galicia]]'' (Kingdom of New Galicia).\n\nThis territory extended from the [[Rio Lerma]] to Sonora, with its capital at [[Compostela, Nayarit|Compostela]]. New Galicia was a separate entity, not under the authority of the Audiencia of Mexico City (but still part of New Spain).\n\nOne nineteenth-century chronicler of the Conquest referred to Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n as \"the detestable governor of P\u00e1nuco and perhaps the most depraved man ever to set foot in New Spain.\"<ref>[[Vicente Riva Palacio]]. ''M\u00e9xico a trav\u00e9s de los siglos'', Vol. II, (Barcelona: Espasa, 1991 [1880]) {{ISBN|978-84-7764-516-0}} cited in Dijes Ant\u00f3n, Juan and Manuel Sagredo y Mart\u00edn. ''Biograf\u00edas de hijos ilustres de la Provincia de Guadalajara''. (Guadalajara, Spain, 1889), 45. Keep in mind that Dijes and Sagredo write, \"It truly jumps to our attention that Riva Palacio starts, as soon as he commences his account of Nu\u00f1o, to use at every step a unique language, applying to him the harshest expressions in the Castilian tongue, language not used with any other, which leaves him open to our attempt to refute him.\" (43) They point out that the other chroniclers of the period\u2014among them [[Bernal D\u00edaz]] and [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] mention very little about Guzm\u00e1n, and what they say is positive. They conclude that Rivas Palacio could have made use of the unpublished sources of the [[Archivo General de Indias|Archives of the Indies]] to come up with his different account.</ref> Fray [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] called him a \"great tyrant\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Final years in Spain==\nReports of Guzm\u00e1n's treatment of the Indigenous had reached Mexico City and Spain, and, at Bishop Zum\u00e1rraga's request the Crown sent [[Diego P\u00e9rez de la Torre]] to investigate. Guzm\u00e1n was arrested in 1536. He was held a prisoner for more than a year and then sent to Spain in fetters. He was released from the [[:es: Castillo de Torrej\u00f3n de Velasco|Castle of Torrej\u00f3n prison]] in 1538. In 1539 he returned to his position as royal ''contino'' bodyguard - court records show him on the payroll every year from 1539 to 1561 (in 1561 as \"deceased\"). In 1552 he wrote up a ''memorial'' containing his own version of the events leading to his fall. In his account he justified his execution of the Pur\u00e9pecha Cazonci as being necessary in order to bring a Christian rule of law to the area, and he assured that: \"in truth no execution more just has been carried out in all of New Spain, and if I were deserving of any punishment it would be for having doubted some days about whether to carry it out.\"<ref>Rojinsky 2010:238 (translated from the Spanish: \"cierto ninguna se ha hecho m\u00e1s justa en toda la Nueva Espa\u00f1a; y si yo alguna pena podia merecer es porque dud\u00e9 algunos d\u00edas de hacerla\"\")</ref>\n\nIn 1558 he wrote his last will which was uncovered in 1973, it shows him as a poverty stricken noble struggling to save his heirs from his debts, having had even to pawn his heirlooms to pay for medicine. In it, he requested some of the property that was confiscated from him to be returned to his heirs, and wages still due to him for his years as Governor and President be paid and turned over to his heirs. With affection he bequeathed most of his belongings to a woman Sabina de Guzm\u00e1n, who had taken care of him in his illness. He also bequeathed belongings to the [[Franciscan Order]], in spite of the conflicts he had had with its members in New Spain.<ref>Chipman 1978</ref> He probably died in Valladolid in 1558 on October 16 or shortly thereafter.<ref>Chipman 1967:280-81</ref>\n\n==Reputation==\nIn posteriority and partly in his own time Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n achieved a reputation as the worst villain of the conquistadors, in the words of his biographer Donald Chipman he has been depicted as the \"personification of the [[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]\".<ref>Chipman 1967:141</ref> His contemporary [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], one of Cort\u00e9s' loyal supporters, described him in the following terms: \"... In all the provinces of New Spain there was not an other man more foul and evil than [Guzm\u00e1n] of P\u00e1nuco\".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} His biographer Santana describes his personality as characterized by \"cruelty of the highest order, ambition without limit, a refined hypocrisy, great immorality, ingratitude without equal, and a fierce hatred for Cort\u00e9s\".<ref>Chipman 1967:142-43</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--If indent param. is used,  Pls use a colon (:) instead of asterisk (*) for bullet markers in the references list -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n: {{cite book|author=Chipman, Donald E.  |title=Nuno de Guzman and the Province of Panuco in New Spain, 1518&ndash;1533|location= Glendale, California|publisher=Arthur H.

Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves. This was meant to provide convenient access to the prison for the Warden while normalizing life for the Warden's wife and children; recognizing his duel role as Warden, and as father/husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmurrayarchitect.ca/fort-saskatchewan-historic-buildings/|title=Fort Saskatchewan Historic Buildings|date=2016-03-02|website=David Murray Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion and development ===\nIn 1952, [[Sherritt Gordon Mines]] started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, which started production in 1954.<ref name=\"peterream4\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=459}}</ref> Following Sherritt Gordon's locating in Fort Saskatchewan, more industries constructed plants in the town.

The Settlement was affirmed in Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799 (6th Cir. 1986). Under the Settlement, defendants agreed to promote system-wide desegregation by a variety of means including (1) attempting to obtain a student body at TSU that is 50% white; (2) assuring that changes in admissions policies do not have adverse racial impact; and (3) actively recruiting African-American faculty and administrative staff for Tennessee's predominantly white institutions.\n\n=== References ===\n", "text_old": "Rita Sanders Geier (nee Rita Sanders) is a civil right pioneer and Commissioner of Social Security Administration.

In the course of Sanders\u2019s ministry, the family moved to several cities in Arkansas and Tennessee.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://alumnus.tennessee.edu/2007/to-do-the-right-thing/|title=To Do the Right Thing|last=alumn_admin|date=2007-04-01|website=Tennessee Alumnus|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1961, Geier graduated from the segregated Melrose High School in Memphis.Grier holds a law degree from [[Vanderbilt University]] and a master\u2019s from the [[University of Chicago]]. She married her husband, Paul, in 1970. The couple lives in Maryland and has two grown sons, Chris and Jon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Career ===\n<br />\n\n=== Lawsuit against University of Tennessee ===\nIn 1968, Grier sued the Governor of Tennessee, the University of Tennessee, Tennessee A & I State University, and various Tennessee education agencies and officials to enjoin UT from expanding its program at a non-degree granting center in Nashville. The complaint alleged that any expansion of UT-N would affect the efforts of [[Tennessee State University]], a predominantly black institution, to desegregate its student body and faculty. Subsequently, the case became a vehicle for the desegregation of state-affiliated colleges and universities in Tennessee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/94/644/602579/|title=Rita Sanders Geier, et al., Plaintiffs-appellees,united States of America, Plaintiff Intervenor-appellee,raymond A.

In 1973, a group of parents, teachers, and faculty members (\"Richardson Intervenors\") were allowed to intervene. In 1983, the district court allowed another group of black and white TSU faculty members and students to intervene (\"McGinnis Intervenors\"). Also in 1983, the district court allowed the Alumni Association, which consists of graduates of TSU, to appear as amicus curiae.\n\nIn 1984, all of the parties except the United States agreed to a settlement agreement (\"Settlement\"), which the district court entered as an order. The Settlement was affirmed in Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799 (6th Cir. 1986). Under the Settlement, defendants agreed to promote system-wide desegregation by a variety of means including (1) attempting to obtain a student body at TSU that is 50% white; (2) assuring that changes in admissions policies do not have adverse racial impact; and (3) actively recruiting African-American faculty and administrative staff for Tennessee's predominantly white institutions.\n\n=== References ===\n", "name_user": "ThePhantom65", "label": "safe", "comment": "added content and citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Sanders_Geier"}
