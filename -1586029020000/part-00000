During the Middle Ages, the study of trigonometry continued in [[Islamic mathematics]], by mathematicians such as [[Al-Khwarizmi]] and [[Abu al-Wafa]]. It became an independent discipline in the [[Islamic world]], where all six [[trigonometric functions]] were known. [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Translations of Arabic and Greek texts]] led to trigonometry being adopted as a subject in the Latin West beginning in the [[Renaissance]] with [[Regiomontanus]]. The development of modern trigonometry shifted during the western [[Age of Enlightenment]], beginning with 17th-century mathematics ([[Isaac Newton]] and [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]]) and reaching its modern form with [[Leonhard Euler]] (1748).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"trigonometry\" was derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd|\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd]] ''trig\u014dnon'', \"triangle\" and [[wikt:\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]] ''metron'', \"measure\".<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trigonometry|title=trigonometry|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nThe modern word \"sine\" is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sinus'', which means \"bay\", \"bosom\" or \"fold\"\nis indirectly, via Indian, Persian and Arabic transmission, derived from the Greek term ''[[Chord (geometry)|khord\u1e17]]'' \"bow-string, chord\". The Hindu term for sine in  [[Sanskrit]] is ''[[jy\u0101]]''  \"bow-string\", the Hindus originally introduced and usually employed three trigonometric functions ''jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101, and utkrama-jy\u0101.''  The Hindus defined these as functions of an arc of a circle, not of an angle, hence their association with a bow string, and hence the \"chord of an arc\" for the arc is called \"a bow\" (dhanu,c\u0101pa). It's synonyms are jiv\u0101, si\u00f1jini, maurvi, guna, etc. The sine function was later also adapted in the variant ''[[j\u012bv\u0101]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jambhekar|first=Ashok|date=January 1983|title=Indian Books of the Quarter|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/097492848303900122|journal=India Quarterly: A Journal of International Affairs|volume=39|issue=1|pages=106\u2013108|doi=10.1177/097492848303900122|issn=0974-9284}}</ref>\nSanskrit ''j\u012bv\u0101'' was rendered (adopted) into Arabic as ''jiba'', written ''jb'' \u062c\u0628.<ref name=\"Boyer91-jiba\">Boyer (1991), page 252: ''It was Robert of Chester's translation from the Arabic that resulted in our word \"sine\".

[...] It is not unlikely that the 260-degree measure was carried over from astronomy, where the zodiac had been divided into twelve \"signs\" or 36 \"decans\". A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts. Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence. Moreover since the Babylonian position system for fractions was so obviously superior to the Egyptians unit fractions and the Greek common fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into sixty ''[[partes minutae primae]]'', each of these latter into sixty ''[[partes minutae secundae]]'', and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that translators used in this connection that our words \"minute\" and \"second\" have been derived. It undoubtedly was the sexagesimal system that led Ptolemy to subdivide the diameter of his trigonometric circle into 120 parts; each of these he further subdivided into sixty minutes and each minute of length sixty seconds.}}</ref> These roughly translate to \"first small parts\" and \"second small parts\".\n\n==Development==\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe ancient [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]]s and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]]s had known of theorems on the ratios of the sides of similar triangles for many centuries.

Theorems on ratios of the sides of similar triangles had been known to, and used by, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. In view of the pre-Hellenic lack of the concept of angle measure, such a study might better be called \"trilaterometry\", or the measure of three sided polygons (trilaterals), than \"trigonometry\", the measure of parts of a triangle. With the Greeks we first find a systematic study of relationships between angles (or arcs) in a circle and the lengths of chords subtending these. Properties of chords, as measures of central and inscribed angles in circles, were familiar to the Greeks of Hippocrates' day, and it is likely that Eudoxus had used ratios and angle measures in determining the size of the earth and the relative distances of the sun and the moon. In the works of Euclid there is no trigonometry in the strict sense of the word, but there are theorems equivalent to specific trigonometric laws or formulas. Propositions II.12 and 13 of the ''Elements'', for example, are the laws of cosines for obtuse and acute angles respectively, stated in geometric rather than trigonometric language and proved by a method similar to that used by Euclid in connection with the Pythagorean theorem. Theorems on the lengths of chords are essentially applications of the modern law of sines. We have seen that Archimedes' theorem on the broken chord can readily be translated into trigonometric language analogous to formulas for sines of sums and differences of angles.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Babylonian astronomer]]s kept detailed records on the rising and setting of [[star]]s, the motion of the [[planet]]s, and the solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, all of which required familiarity with [[Angle|angular]] distances measured on the [[celestial sphere]].<ref name=\"Maor-20\">{{Cite book |title=Trigonometric Delights |first=Eli |last=Maor |year=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09541-7 |page=20}}</ref> Based on one interpretation of the [[Plimpton 322]] [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet (c. 1900 BC), some have even asserted that the ancient Babylonians had a table of secants.<ref>Joseph [[#joseph-2000b|(2000b, pp.383&ndash;84)]].</ref> There is, however, much debate as to whether it is a table of [[Pythagorean triple]]s, a solution of quadratic equations, or a [[Generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric table]].\n\nThe Egyptians, on the other hand, used a primitive form of trigonometry for building [[pyramid]]s in the 2nd millennium BC.<ref name=\"Maor-20\"/> The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]], written by the Egyptian scribe [[Ahmes]] (c. 1680\u20131620 BC), contains the following problem related to trigonometry:<ref name=\"Maor-20\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"If a pyramid is 250 cubits high and the side of its base 360 cubits long, what is its ''[[seked]]''?\"}}\nAhmes' solution to the problem is the ratio of half the side of the base of the pyramid to its height, or the run-to-rise ratio of its face.

The Hindus defined these as functions of an arc of a circle, not of an angle, hence their association with a bow string, and hence the \"chord of an arc\" for the arc is called \"a bow\" (dhanu,c\u0101pa). It's synonyms are jiv\u0101, si\u00f1jini, maurvi, guna, etc. The sine function was later also adapted in the variant ''[[j\u012bv\u0101]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jambhekar|first=Ashok|date=January 1983|title=Indian Books of the Quarter|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/097492848303900122|journal=India Quarterly: A Journal of International Affairs|volume=39|issue=1|pages=106\u2013108|doi=10.1177/097492848303900122|issn=0974-9284}}</ref>\nSanskrit ''j\u012bv\u0101''  was rendered adopted into Arabic as ''jiba'', written ''jb'' \u062c\u0628.<ref name=\"Boyer91-jiba\">Boyer (1991), page 252: ''It was Robert of Chester's translation from the Arabic that resulted in our word \"sine\".

A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts. Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence. Moreover since the Babylonian position system for fractions was so obviously superior to the Egyptians unit fractions and the Greek common fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into sixty ''[[partes minutae primae]]'', each of these latter into sixty ''[[partes minutae secundae]]'', and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that translators used in this connection that our words \"minute\" and \"second\" have been derived.

Theorems on ratios of the sides of similar triangles had been known to, and used by, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. In view of the pre-Hellenic lack of the concept of angle measure, such a study might better be called \"trilaterometry\", or the measure of three sided polygons (trilaterals), than \"trigonometry\", the measure of parts of a triangle. With the Greeks we first find a systematic study of relationships between angles (or arcs) in a circle and the lengths of chords subtending these. Properties of chords, as measures of central and inscribed angles in circles, were familiar to the Greeks of Hippocrates' day, and it is likely that Eudoxus had used ratios and angle measures in determining the size of the earth and the relative distances of the sun and the moon. In the works of Euclid there is no trigonometry in the strict sense of the word, but there are theorems equivalent to specific trigonometric laws or formulas. Propositions II.12 and 13 of the ''Elements'', for example, are the laws of cosines for obtuse and acute angles respectively, stated in geometric rather than trigonometric language and proved by a method similar to that used by Euclid in connection with the Pythagorean theorem.

He describes his living days as misery, but when he dreams of Gloria, he says his nights are liberty. The protagonist describes Gloria as his queen imagination that comes from his fascination, not from any kind of fantasy. He further elaborates that he has always set Gloria free from him, just as he has set freedom from reality. He then tells that his friends think he is crazy, but he argues his point that they have never met Gloria (so far, he has no proof of her actual existence); but one day when he finds her, he says his friends will talk about Gloria's beauty and her loyalty. To accomplish the goal of realizing his dreams despite everyone else's protests, the protagonist sets all his life to search for Gloria until he meets her in reality, and then promises to hold her, to touch her, and to keep her because he loves Gloria.<ref name=\"utozzijkinggloria\"/>\n\n===Track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = 7\" single<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/727818 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (Vinyl, 7\") at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| length1         = 4:25\n| title2          = Aria di lei\n| length2         = 4:10\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = 12\" single<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/2985347 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (Vinyl, 12\") at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| note1           = 12\" disco mix\n| length1         = 7:05\n| title2          = [[Mama (Umberto Tozzi and Laura Branigan song)|Mama]]\n| length2         = 5:07\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = 12\" single {{nobold|(UK)}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/1232262 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (Vinyl, 12\" UK) at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| note1           = English version\n| length1         = 6:30\n| title2          = Gloria\n| note2           = Italian version\n| length2         = 4:25\n| title3          = Aria di lei\n| length3         = 4:10\n}}\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = CD single {{nobold|\u2013 2001 version}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/4374370 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (CD) at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| note1           = 2001 version\n| length1         = 4:57\n| title2          = Gloria\n| note2           = Remixland radio edit\n| length2         = 4:25\n| title3          = Gloria\n| note3           = Remixland extended\n| length3         = 5:39\n| title4          = Gloria\n| note4           = La Fabrique Du Sons dub remix\n| length4         = 6:03\n| title5          = Gloria\n| note5           = Original version\n| length5         = 4:55\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Digital download {{nobold|\u2013 2011 remixes}}<ref name=\"Gloria 2011\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CJE9OCA/ |title=Gloria 2011: Umberto Tozzi |date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria 2011\n| note1           = Club edit\n| length1         = 4:09\n| title2          = Gloria 2011\n| note2           = Sorrentino & Zara Italian radio mix\n| length2         = 4:25\n| title3          = Gloria 2011\n| note3           = Sorrentino & Zara English radio mix\n| length3         = 4:25\n| title4          = Gloria 2011\n| note4           = Club mix\n| length4         = 7:13\n| title5          = Gloria 2011\n| note5           = Sorrentino & Zara Italian extended mix\n| length5         = 6:12\n| title6          = Gloria 2011\n| note6           = Sorrentino & Zara English extended mix\n| length6         = 6:27\n}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Personnel===\n*[[Umberto Tozzi]] - vocals, chorus\n*[[Greg Mathieson]] - conductor, piano, keyboards\n*[[Barry Morgan (musician)|Barry Morgan]] - drums\n*[[Mats Bj\u00f6rklund]] - guitar\n*[[Les Hurdle]] - bass\n*[[Filarmonica Di Monaco]] - strings\n*[[Euro Cristiani]] - chorus\n\n===Charts===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1979)\n!Peak #\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book| title=Australian Chart Chronicles (1940\u20132008)|last=Kent|first=David|publisher=Australian Chart Book, 2009| location= Turramurra NSW|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-646-51203-7}}</ref>\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright collapsible collapsed\" \n!style=\"font-weight: normal;

Ultimately, Branigan recorded an English re-invention of \"Gloria\" as a character study of, in her words, \"a girl that's running too fast for her own steps\", the cover lyrics of which were written by [[Trevor Veitch]], the contractor for the ''Branigan'' album, to which he also contributed guitar work; while Branigan also did her part in co-writing of the cover song's lyrics.\n\nIn 2003, Branigan characterized \"Gloria\" as \"Certainly my signature song. And I always get the same reaction wherever I go, and whenever I perform it ... I have to end every show with that song, and people just go crazy.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.laurabraniganonline.com/images/innewswkly_030820.pdf |title=The Lucky One |work=In Newsweekly |via=Laura Branigan website |date=August 20, 2003}}</ref>\n\nBranigan later released a [[Hi-NRG]] re-recording of the song just a few months before her death. \"Gloria 2004\" was released with several remixes on April 26, 2004.\n\n===Popular success===\n\"Gloria\" attained its highest profile via a re-working featured on the 1982 album ''[[Branigan]]'', the first released album by Branigan. Although another selection, \"[[All Night with Me]]\", was chosen as the album's lead-off single, Branigan also performed the cover song during her promotional TV appearances at the time of the album's release in early 1982,<ref name=\"veitchutozzigloria\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=355Fk8drgZE |title=Video of Laura Branigan's cover of 'Gloria' |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref> and that track was released as a single in the summer, first becoming a [[disco]] favorite, and gradually accruing radio support to debut on the pop charts in July 1982. The single reached number 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on November 27, behind [[Lionel Richie]]'s \"[[Truly (song)|Truly]]\", and remained there in the following two weeks, through December 11\u2014when Richie had been supplanted by [[Toni Basil]]'s \"[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]\".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1982-12-11 Hot 100 December 11 1982] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109200140/http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1982-12-11 |date=November 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n\"Gloria\" earned Branigan a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance Female Grammy Award]] for the year 1982.

''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine's Top 100 ranked \"Gloria\" at number 1. Certified platinum for sales of one million in the United States alone, \"Gloria\" was also an international success, most notably in [[Australia]] where it held the number 1 position for seven consecutive weeks, from February 7 to March 21, 1983. \"Gloria\" also took Branigan to the Top-10 charts in [[Canada]] at number 1, the [[United Kingdom]] at number 6, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] at number 4, [[South Africa]] at number 9, [[New Zealand]] at number 6, and number 36 in [[Italy]].\n\n===Notable inclusions===\nBranigan's cover of \"Gloria\" appeared in the musical drama ''[[Flashdance]]'' in 1983, though it was not included in the film's soundtrack. In a nod to her hit, Branigan's rendition of \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" performed on the ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' Christmas special featured the background vocalists singing the name \"Gloria\", evoking both Branigan's signature song and the Latin refrain of the Christmas carol \"[[Angels We Have Heard on High]].\"\n\nBranigan guest starred as the lead singer of an all-female band in the February 20, 1983 episode of ''[[CHiPs]]'' titled \"Fox Trap,\" in which she lip-synced to her version of \"Gloria.\"\n\nBranigan's \"Gloria\" was featured in the 2006 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'' on the in-game pop radio station \"Flash FM\".\n\nThe song appears as a cassette tape in ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'', both prequels set in the early 1980s.\n\nThe song has been used in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s animated TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.\n\nAn excerpt of the song was performed by [[Debbie Reynolds]] on ''[[Will & Grace]]'' in the season 3 episode, \"Lows in the Mid-Eighties\"\n\nThe cover song was also incorporated into the score of ''[[Flashdance the Musical]]'' in a scene where the character named Gloria performs a [[pole dance]] routine; sung by Djalenja Scott and Carryl Thomas in Ruthie Stephens' 2008\u201309 national tour of the musical, and by [[Twinnie-Lee Moore]] and Hannah Levane in the 2010\u201311's play at [[West End theatre]], where Charlotte Harwood assumed the role of Gloria.\n\nAt the end of the trailer for the post-apocalyptic comedy series ''[[The Last Man on Earth (TV series)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', Phil Tandy, who at the time happens to be the last person alive, sings \"Gloria\" on a megaphone as a desperate call for contact with a woman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwnQ-SbtJug |title=The Last Man On Earth - Fox - Trailer |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Lea Michele]], [[Naya Rivera]] and [[Adam Lambert]] covered this version in the ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' episode \"[[Trio (Glee)|Trio]]\".\n\nIn the ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' episode \"Sci Hard\", Agent [[Cabe Gallo]]'s lemon car had a cassette tape with this version of the song stuck in the car's player. As a result, the song played whenever Cabe used his car in the episode, with Cabe singing it to himself at one point. At the end of the episode, \"Gloria\" plays during the climatic chase scene which ends with the bad guys' motorcycles crashing into Cabe's car, resulting in the tape ejecting and the song ending.\n\nIn 2017, the first episode of the BBC/Netflix series ''[[White Gold (TV series)|White Gold]]'' began with the song.\n\nAn excerpt of the song appears twice in 2017's ''[[I, Tonya]]''.

The dramatic turnaround in the Blues' fortunes following their adoption of \"Gloria\" led to it being embraced as their new victory anthem. The song is played at [[Enterprise Center]] every time the Blues win a game, leading to \"Play Gloria!\" becoming both a [[meme]] and victory chant for Blues fans.

He describes his living days as misery, but when he dreams of Gloria, he says his nights are liberty. The protagonist describes Gloria as his queen imagination that comes from his fascination, not from any kind of fantasy. He further elaborates that he has always set Gloria free from him, just as he has set freedom from reality. He then tells that his friends think he is crazy, but he argues his point that they have never met Gloria (so far, he has no proof of her actual existence); but one day when he finds her, he says his friends will talk about Gloria's beauty and her loyalty. To accomplish the goal of realizing his dreams despite everyone else's protests, the protagonist sets all his life to search for Gloria until he meets her in reality, and then promises to hold her, to touch her, and to keep her because he loves Gloria.<ref name=\"utozzijkinggloria\"/>\n\n===Track listings===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = 7\" single<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/727818 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (Vinyl, 7\") at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| length1         = 4:25\n| title2          = Aria di lei\n| length2         = 4:10\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = 12\" single<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/2985347 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (Vinyl, 12\") at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| note1           = 12\" disco mix\n| length1         = 7:05\n| title2          = [[Mama (Umberto Tozzi and Laura Branigan song)|Mama]]\n| length2         = 5:07\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = 12\" single {{nobold|(UK)}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/1232262 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (Vinyl, 12\" UK) at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| note1           = English version\n| length1         = 6:30\n| title2          = Gloria\n| note2           = Italian version\n| length2         = 4:25\n| title3          = Aria di lei\n| length3         = 4:10\n}}\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = CD single {{nobold|\u2013 2001 version}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Umberto-Tozzi-Gloria/release/4374370 |title=Umberto Tozzi - Gloria (CD) at Discogs |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria\n| note1           = 2001 version\n| length1         = 4:57\n| title2          = Gloria\n| note2           = Remixland radio edit\n| length2         = 4:25\n| title3          = Gloria\n| note3           = Remixland extended\n| length3         = 5:39\n| title4          = Gloria\n| note4           = La Fabrique Du Sons dub remix\n| length4         = 6:03\n| title5          = Gloria\n| note5           = Original version\n| length5         = 4:55\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Digital download {{nobold|\u2013 2011 remixes}}<ref name=\"Gloria 2011\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CJE9OCA/ |title=Gloria 2011: Umberto Tozzi |date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>\n| title1          = Gloria 2011\n| note1           = Club edit\n| length1         = 4:09\n| title2          = Gloria 2011\n| note2           = Sorrentino & Zara Italian radio mix\n| length2         = 4:25\n| title3          = Gloria 2011\n| note3           = Sorrentino & Zara English radio mix\n| length3         = 4:25\n| title4          = Gloria 2011\n| note4           = Club mix\n| length4         = 7:13\n| title5          = Gloria 2011\n| note5           = Sorrentino & Zara Italian extended mix\n| length5         = 6:12\n| title6          = Gloria 2011\n| note6           = Sorrentino & Zara English extended mix\n| length6         = 6:27\n}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Personnel===\n*[[Umberto Tozzi]] - vocals, chorus\n*[[Greg Mathieson]] - conductor, piano, keyboards\n*[[Barry Morgan (musician)|Barry Morgan]] - drums\n*[[Mats Bj\u00f6rklund]] - guitar\n*[[Les Hurdle]] - bass\n*[[Filarmonica Di Monaco]] - strings\n*[[Euro Cristiani]] - chorus\n\n===Charts===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1979)\n!Peak #\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite book| title=Australian Chart Chronicles (1940\u20132008)|last=Kent|first=David|publisher=Australian Chart Book, 2009| location= Turramurra NSW|year=2009|isbn= 978-0-646-51203-7}}</ref>\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright collapsible collapsed\" \n!style=\"font-weight: normal;

Ultimately, Branigan recorded an English re-invention of \"Gloria\" as a character study of, in her words, \"a girl that's running too fast for her own steps\", the cover lyrics of which were written by [[Trevor Veitch]], the contractor for the ''Branigan'' album, to which he also contributed guitar work; while Branigan also did her part in co-writing of the cover song's lyrics.\n\nIn 2003, Branigan characterized \"Gloria\" as \"Certainly my signature song.

Although another selection, \"[[All Night with Me]]\", was chosen as the album's lead-off single, Branigan also performed the cover song during her promotional TV appearances at the time of the album's release in early 1982,<ref name=\"veitchutozzigloria\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=355Fk8drgZE |title=Video of Laura Branigan's cover of 'Gloria' |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref> and that track was released as a single in the summer, first becoming a [[disco]] favorite, and gradually accruing radio support to debut on the pop charts in July 1982. The single reached number 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on November 27, behind [[Lionel Richie]]'s \"[[Truly (song)|Truly]]\", and remained there in the following two weeks, through December 11\u2014when Richie had been supplanted by [[Toni Basil]]'s \"[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]\".<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1982-12-11 Hot 100 December 11 1982] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109200140/http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1982-12-11 |date=November 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n\"Gloria\" earned Branigan a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Vocal Performance Female Grammy Award]] for the year 1982.

''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine's Top 100 ranked \"Gloria\" at number 1. Certified platinum for sales of one million in the United States alone, \"Gloria\" was also an international success, most notably in [[Australia]] where it held the number 1 position for seven consecutive weeks, from February 7 to March 21, 1983. \"Gloria\" also took Branigan to the Top-10 charts in [[Canada]] at number 1, the [[United Kingdom]] at number 6, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] at number 4, [[South Africa]] at number 9, [[New Zealand]] at number 6, and number 36 in [[Italy]].\n\n===Notable inclusions===\nBranigan's cover of \"Gloria\" appeared in the musical drama ''[[Flashdance]]'' in 1983, though it was not included in the film's soundtrack. In a nod to her hit, Branigan's rendition of \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" performed on the ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' Christmas special featured the background vocalists singing the name \"Gloria\", evoking both Branigan's signature song and the Latin refrain of the Christmas carol \"[[Angels We Have Heard on High]].\"\n\nBranigan guest starred as the lead singer of an all-female band in the February 20, 1983 episode of ''[[CHiPs]]'' titled \"Fox Trap,\" in which she lip-synced to her version of \"Gloria.\"\n\nBranigan's \"Gloria\" was featured in the 2006 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]]'' on the in-game pop radio station \"Flash FM\".\n\nThe song appears as a cassette tape in ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'', both prequels set in the early 1980s.\n\nThe song has been used in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s animated TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.\n\nAn excerpt of the song was performed by [[Debbie Reynolds]] on ''[[Will & Grace]]'' in the season 3 episode, \"Lows in the Mid-Eighties\"\n\nThe cover song was also incorporated into the score of ''[[Flashdance the Musical]]'' in a scene where the character named Gloria performs a [[pole dance]] routine; sung by Djalenja Scott and Carryl Thomas in Ruthie Stephens' 2008\u201309 national tour of the musical, and by [[Twinnie-Lee Moore]] and Hannah Levane in the 2010\u201311's play at [[West End theatre]], where Charlotte Harwood assumed the role of Gloria.\n\nAt the end of the trailer for the post-apocalyptic comedy series ''[[The Last Man on Earth (TV series)|The Last Man on Earth]]'', Phil Tandy, who at the time happens to be the last person alive, sings \"Gloria\" on a megaphone as a desperate call for contact with a woman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwnQ-SbtJug |title=The Last Man On Earth - Fox - Trailer |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Lea Michele]], [[Naya Rivera]] and [[Adam Lambert]] covered this version in the ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' episode \"[[Trio (Glee)|Trio]]\".\n\nIn the ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]'' episode \"Sci Hard\", Agent [[Cabe Gallo]]'s lemon car had a cassette tape with this version of the song stuck in the car's player. As a result, the song played whenever Cabe used his car in the episode, with Cabe singing it to himself at one point. At the end of the episode, \"Gloria\" plays during the climatic chase scene which ends with the bad guys' motorcycles crashing into Cabe's car, resulting in the tape ejecting and the song ending.\n\nIn 2017, the first episode of the BBC/Netflix series ''[[White Gold (TV series)|White Gold]]'' began with the song.\n\nAn excerpt of the song appears twice in 2017's ''[[I, Tonya]]''. The song appears in the scenes featuring the man who assaulted [[Nancy Kerrigan]], Shane Stant.\n\nThe Branigan version of the song is featured in an episode of the [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|second installment]] of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]''. The song plays on the radio as [[Andrew Cunanan]] sings along to it.\n\nBranigan\u2019s cover of the song is used along with other 1980s hits in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Splatty Tomato]]\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 355px\"\n! style=\"background: #F0E68C; font-size: 65%\"|from \"Julianne Moore Danced the Night Away at the Premiere <br> of ''Gloria Bell''\" by Keaton Bell@Vogue.com (5 March 2019)\n|-\n| style=\"font-size: 75%\"| \"[In what's] easily five of the most joyful minutes ever put to film [Gloria Bell] slowly approach[es] the dance floor as her theme song<span style=\"font-size:50%\">...</span>plays & [then] nearly bursts in a fit of ecstasy dancing to the music.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.vogue.com/article/julianne-moore-gloria-bell-premiere |title = Julianne Moore Danced the Night Away at the Premiere of Gloria Bell}}</ref>\n|}\n\nChilean screenwriter/director [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio]] utilized the Umberto Tozzi rendition of \"Gloria\" in the 2013 film ''[[Gloria (2013 film)|Gloria]]'': Lelio's 2019 English-language remake ''[[Gloria Bell]]'' features the title character (played by [[Julianne Moore]]) dancing to Branigan's take on the song in a sequence hailed as an essential highlight of the film:<ref>https://www.dispatch.com/entertainmentlife/20190322/movie-review--gloria-bell-julianne-moore-is-knockout-talent-in-working-class-turn</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/gloria-bell-review-1.28473865 |title = Newsday &#124; Long Island's & NYC's News Source &#124; Newsday}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.sfexaminer.com/entertainment/julianne-moore-dances-in-gloria-bell/ | title=Julianne Moore dances in 'Gloria Bell'| date=2019-03-14}}</ref><ref>https://www.yourobserver.com/article/gloria-bell-film-julianne-moore-review-observer</ref>\n\n==== Use by the St. Louis Blues ====\n\nThe [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[St. Louis Blues]] began using Branigan's cover version of \"Gloria\" as its unofficial victory song when they went on a franchise-record 11-game winning streak during the [[2018\u201319 St. Louis Blues season|2018\u201319 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/blues/news/gloria-the-story-behind-the-blues-new-old-postgame-victory-song/c-304750776|title=Gloria!

The dramatic turnaround in the Blues' fortunes following their adoption of \"Gloria\" led to it being embraced as their new victory anthem.

Mexican pop was limited to Latin America until the mid-1990s, when an interest towards this type of music increased after [[Selena]]'s, [[Luis Miguel]]'s, [[Paulina Rubio]]'s, [[Thal\u00eda]]'s and [[Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda]]'s debuts before the mainstream USA audience.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted on Spanish-language versions of English-language [[rock-and-roll]] hits. Singers and musical groups like [[C\u00e9sar Costa]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda]], [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Alberto V\u00e1zquez (singer)|Alberto V\u00e1zquez]], [[Manolo Mu\u00f1oz]], [[Johnny Laboriel]], [[Julissa]] or Los Teen Tops performed cover versions of songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Paul Anka]] and others.\n\n==1970s and 1980s==\n[[File:Escultura_de_Jos\u00e9_Jos\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|[[bronze statue|Statue]] of [[crooner]] [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]] El Pr\u00edncipe de la Canci\u00f3n (The [[Prince]] of Song) in Mexico City.]]\n[[File:Juan Gabriel in 2006.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Juan Gabriel]] a.k.a El Divo de Ju\u00e1rez (The Divo of Juarez).]]\n\nOn September 13, 1969, [[Televisa]], a Mexican company and the world's largest Spanish-language [[television network]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Televisa Brings 2006 FIFA World Cup to Mexico in HD With Snell & Wilcox Kahuna SD/HD Production Switcher |work=Press release |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=[[Snell Limited|Snell & Wilcox]] |url=http://www.snellwilcox.com/news_events/press_releases/203 |accessdate=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811082252/http://www.snellwilcox.com/news_events/press_releases/203 |archivedate=2006-08-11}}</ref> launched the [[variety show]] ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]'' (''Always on Sundays'') hosted by [[Ra\u00fal Velasco]]. ''Siempre en Domingo'' became one of the most popular TV shows in Latin America with about 420 million television viewers around the world (according to Televisa and their partners). ''Siempre en Domingo'' was a TV show where many artists performed and debuted. At the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success and performers considered an appearance on the program as a guarantee of stardom similar to [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] in the United States. Velasco encouraged many Mexican singers such as [[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]], [[Lucero (actress)|Lucero]], [[Emmanuel Acha|Emmanuel]], [[Manuel Mijares|Mijares]], [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Timbiriche]], and [[Lorenzo Antonio]], and helped many of these to become full-fledged stars within the county. Moreover, Velasco presented foreign artists such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Chayanne]] and [[Ricky Martin]]. Artists that would bring pop music to Latin America, were, in part by ''Siempre en Domingo'', helped in that effort thanks for their appearances in the program.\n\n1970 Jose Jose jumped to fame when he sang \"El Triste\" at the [[Festival Mundial de la Canci\u00f3n Latina|Festival de la Canci\u00f3n Latina]]. He didn't win the prestigious singing contest but his performance was so memorable that fans across Latin America considered him the actual winner.\n\n[[File:Luc\u00eda Leticia M\u00e9ndez P\u00e9rez.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]] Actress and Singer]]\nDuring the 1980s songwriters like Guillermo M\u00e9ndez Gui\u00fa, Rafael P\u00e9rez Botija or Aureo Baqueiro wrote songs for singers like [[Yuri (Mexican)|Yuri]], Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez and musical groups like Timbiriche, [[Flans]] and [[Fandango (Mexican band)|Fandango]]. These groups headed the radio charts in Mexico and launched international career by promoting their music in Latin America.

Although not all of these singers are from Mexico.\n\nThe most well-known Mexican singer of the 1970s and 1980s was [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]]. Known as \"El Principe de La Cancion\" (The Prince of the Song), he is recognizable for his romantic ballads and gifted vocals. Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 has sold over 40 million albums in his career and became a huge influence to very popular singers like: [[Cristian Castro]], [[Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Nelson Ned]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Manuel Mijares]], [[Lupita D'Alessio]], and [[Reyli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famaweb.com/jose_jose_quotesta_es_mi_vidaquot_lanzamiento-6005.html |title=Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 \"Esta es mi Vida\" LANZAMIENTO |publisher=Famaweb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025440/http://www.famaweb.com/jose_jose_quotesta_es_mi_vidaquot_lanzamiento-6005.html |archivedate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Thal\u00eda]] became part of Timbiriche in the 1980s, tension with [[Paulina Rubio|Paulina]] a group member became instantaneous and the rivalry to monopolize the lead role was warming the atmosphere and culminated at a point in which they ended up graving each other's hairs on stage.

Before the teen [[bubblegum pop]] explosion in the US during the late 1990s, many pop acts came to light during the mid-1990s in Mexico and became successful. Most of them lasted until the end of the decade. This includes boybands Mercurio, Ragazzi, Tierra Cero and Kairo, female singers [[Lynda Thomas]], [[Fey (singer)|Fey]], [[Alessandra Rosaldo]], [[Jeans (band)|Jeans]], [[Ir\u00e1n Castillo]], [[Edith M\u00e1rquez]], [[Bibi Gaytan]], [[Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (singer)|Maria Jose]], [[Patricia Manterola]] and boy/girl groups [[Pandora (musical group)|Pandora]], [[Sentidos Opuestos]], [[Onda Vaselina]], [[Kabah (band)|Kabah]], [[Sentidos Opuestos]]. [[Cal\u00f3 (banda)|Calo]] and the comeback of [[Timbiriche]] in 1998. Minor one-hit wonder acts were successful during this era which were also focused on a teen pop formula.\n\n[[File:LuceroHogazaLeon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]] gained fame for his particular tone of voice, \nthat launched her to stardom within the pop genre. Affectionately known as La Novia de America (The [[Bride]] of [[Americas|America]]).]]\n\nIn 1992 [[Vikki Carr]] an American from El Paso, Texas, born to parents of Mexican ancestry won the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album]] for [[Cosas del Amor (Vikki Carr album)|Cosas del Amor]] an album with the  lead single being a [[duet]] with [[Ana Gabriel]] of the same name. The track earned awards such as a [[Lo Nuestro Awards]] for [[Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year|Best Pop Song]] and the Single of the Year mention by the [[Radio & Records|Radio y M\u00fasica]] journal.\n\nBy the early to mid 1990s, the torch for Mexican music was carried by another [[Mexican-American]] singer who had grown up speaking English and learned Spanish as a second language. Texas-born [[Selena Quintanilla Perez|Selena]] was a [[Grammy Award]] winning [[Tejano (music)|Tejano]] singer, who also sang many genres. After bypassing all the Tejano barriors{{typo help inline|reason=similar to barriers|date=November 2019}}, she quickly earned the title \"Queen of Tejano Music.\" Selena became the first Latin artist to have four number ones in one year in 1994. The four were [[Donde Quiera Que Est\u00e9s]], [[Amor Prohibido (song)|Amor Prohibido]], [[Bidi Bidi Bom Bom]] and [[No Me Queda Mas]]. After her success in Spanish and winning a Grammy Award, Selena went to work on her very first English album. The irony was that English was Selena's first language, as she had grown up in Texas and Spanish was actually her ''second'' language. Sadly, Selena was murdered in March 1995.\n\n[[File:Luismiguelcomplices2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Luis Miguel]] \"El sol de Mexico\" (The Sun of Mexico) in [[Mexico city]].]]\n\nSelena only recorded 4 songs for her [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] album and was scheduled to have 13 songs in English for her album. The crossover album titled [[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]] was released in the summer of 1995. It quickly became an International Success. Selena's songs [[Dreaming of You (Selena song)|Dreaming of You]] and [[I Could Fall In Love]] quickly became crossover hits on American English language Top-40 and Adult Contemporary radio stations, with the single \"Dreaming of You\" also certified Gold. The album became among the \"Top ten best-selling debuts of all time\" along with being the \"Best-selling debuts for a Lat\u00edn Female artist.\" Selena became the first Latin Artist, male or female, to have ever debuted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200]] all-genres album chart. This career achievement helped create the Lat\u00edn boom in the late 1990s\n\n[[File:Thal\u00eda in concert2.jpg|thumb|upright|Thal\u00eda rose to fame as a member of the musical group Timbiriche.]]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Ricky Martin's success in Europe with the hit ''[[Mar\u00eda (Ricky Martin song)|Mar\u00eda]]'' and the international launch of [[1998 World Cup]]'s theme song, ''[[The Cup of Life]]'', and [[Enrique iglesias]] success launched a renewed interest in Latin American music. Mexican pop music started to look attractive to international markets.\n\nThe most successful Mexican singer of the 1990s was [[Luis Miguel]]. Best known for his technically skilled and smooth crooning vocals, Luis Miguel's super-stardom began since the late 1980s. In 1991, his career went to even greater heights and earned him the respect of a wider audience with the release of ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'', an album of romantic [[bolero]]s. Most of them were from the 1940s and 1950s. Despite singing boleros from years past, Luis Miguel was recognized for reinventing the bolero for modern audiences. The album ''Romance'', which became his most successful album ever, eventually sold 15 million units worldwide. Luis Miguel has successfully performed [[pop music]], bolero, [[mariachi]] and romantic ballads. He has won four [[Latin Grammy Awards]], five [[Grammy Awards]], and has sold an estimate of 90 million albums until today. He is known in Latin America and Spain as \"El Sol de M\u00e9xico\" (The Sun of Mexico).\n\n[[Image:Paulina2014.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Paulina Rubio]] rose to fame as a member of the musical group Timbiriche.]]\n\n[[Thal\u00eda]] often referred to as the \"Queen of Latin Pop\"\nTelevisa has exported media to many countries. This has allowed Mexican actors to take advantage of their popularity to launch music careers in countries where Televisa [[telenovela]]s are popular. Some examples of these actors are Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, [[Ver\u00f3nica Castro]] and [[Guillermo Capetillo]]. Ver\u00f3nica's son, [[Cristian Castro]], started his career around this time and became popular throughout Latin America.\n\nThe most successful singer to combine [[ranchera]], [[mariachi]] and [[pop music]] was [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. He originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music. However, his later work was focused on mainstream pop music.\n\nSingers such as [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Gloria Trevi]], and [[Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula]] have also produced songs that combine traditional Mexican music with popular music. The Mexican pop singers who were very successful in Mexico and the rest of North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia are [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Paulina Rubio]].\n\nThe idea of creating a pop band after a telenovela was first explored in 1991 with the cast of [[Mu\u00f1ecos de Papel]] (With [[Ricky Martin]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Rivera]], and former Timbiriche members [[Sasha Sokol]] and [[Erik Rubin]]). In 1999, the same formula was explored with the telenovela [[DKDA]] with Alessandra Rossaldo (then member of [[Sentidos Opuestos]]), [[Patricio Borghetti]] and [[Ernesto D'Alessio]]. This formula would be explored again in 2004 with the creation of the most successful group in Latinamerica [[RBD]].\n\n==2000s and 2010s==\n[[Image:Natalia Lafourcade 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Natalia Lafourcade]] since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in the pop rock scene in Latin America.]]\n\nIn 2000, Gloria Trevi, Andrade, and backup singer Maria Raquenel Portillo were arrested in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on charges of corrupting minors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/14/world/mexican-star-in-sex-case-is-arrested-in-rio.html Mexican Star in Sex Case Is Arrested in Rio]</ref><ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-12-23-trevi_x.htm Prosecutor wants charges against Trevi]</ref> Trevi was cleared of the charges in 2004, due to lack of evidence, after spending four years and eight months in prison.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/23/artsnews.mexico Mexico's Madonna free at last in climax to real-life soap]</ref>\n\nThe century saw new groups [[Sin Bandera]], [[RBD]], [[Belanova]], [[Playa Limbo]], and [[Jotdog]] as well as new and solo debut singers like [[Dulce Maria]], [[Anah\u00ed]], [[Belinda (entertainer)|Belinda]], [[Maite Perroni]], [[Julieta Venegas]], [[Ximena Sari\u00f1ana]] and [[Kika Edgar]].

''Siempre en Domingo'' became one of the most popular TV shows in Latin America with about 420 million television viewers around the world (according to Televisa and their partners). ''Siempre en Domingo'' was a TV show where many artists performed and debuted. At the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success and performers considered an appearance on the program as a guarantee of stardom similar to [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] in the United States. Velasco encouraged many Mexican singers such as [[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]], [[Lucero (actress)|Lucero]], [[Emmanuel Acha|Emmanuel]], [[Manuel Mijares|Mijares]], [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Timbiriche]], and [[Lorenzo Antonio]], and helped many of these to become full-fledged stars within the county. Moreover, Velasco presented foreign artists such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Chayanne]] and [[Ricky Martin]]. Artists that would bring pop music to Latin America, were, in part by ''Siempre en Domingo'', helped in that effort thanks for their appearances in the program.\n\n1970 Jose Jose jumped to fame when he sang \"El Triste\" at the [[Festival Mundial de la Canci\u00f3n Latina|Festival de la Canci\u00f3n Latina]]. He didn't win the prestigious singing contest but his performance was so memorable that fans across Latin America considered him the actual winner.\n\n[[File:Luc\u00eda Leticia M\u00e9ndez P\u00e9rez.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]] Actress and Singer]]\nDuring the 1980s songwriters like Guillermo M\u00e9ndez Gui\u00fa, Rafael P\u00e9rez Botija or Aureo Baqueiro wrote songs for singers like [[Yuri (Mexican)|Yuri]], Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez and musical groups like Timbiriche, [[Flans]] and [[Fandango (Mexican band)|Fandango]].

Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 has sold over 40 million albums in his career and became a huge influence to very popular singers like: [[Cristian Castro]], [[Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Nelson Ned]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Manuel Mijares]], [[Lupita D'Alessio]], and [[Reyli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famaweb.com/jose_jose_quotesta_es_mi_vidaquot_lanzamiento-6005.html |title=Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 \"Esta es mi Vida\" LANZAMIENTO |publisher=Famaweb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025440/http://www.famaweb.com/jose_jose_quotesta_es_mi_vidaquot_lanzamiento-6005.html |archivedate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Thal\u00eda]] became part of Timbiriche in the 80's, tension with [[Paulina Rubio|Paulina]] a group member became instantaneous and the rivalry to monopolize the lead role was warming the atmosphere and culminated at a point in which they ended up graving each other's hairs on stage.

Before the teen [[bubblegum pop]] explosion in the US during the late 90's, many pop acts came to light during the mid-90's in Mexico and became successful. Most of them lasted until the end of the decade. This includes boybands Mercurio, Ragazzi, Tierra Cero and Kairo, female singers [[Lynda Thomas]], [[Fey (singer)|Fey]], [[Alessandra Rosaldo]], [[Jeans (band)|Jeans]], [[Ir\u00e1n Castillo]], [[Edith M\u00e1rquez]], [[Bibi Gaytan]], [[Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (singer)|Maria Jose]], [[Patricia Manterola]] and boy/girl groups [[Pandora (musical group)|Pandora]], [[Sentidos Opuestos]], [[Onda Vaselina]], [[Kabah (band)|Kabah]], [[Sentidos Opuestos]]. [[Cal\u00f3 (banda)|Calo]] and the comeback of [[Timbiriche]] in 1998. Minor one-hit wonder acts were successful during this era which were also focused on a teen pop formula.\n\n[[File:LuceroHogazaLeon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]] gained fame for his particular tone of voice, \nthat launched her to stardom within the pop genre. Affectionately known as La Novia de America (The [[Bride]] of [[Americas|America]]).]]\n\nIn 1992 [[Vikki Carr]] an American from El Paso, Texas, born to parents of Mexican ancestry won the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album]] for [[Cosas del Amor (Vikki Carr album)|Cosas del Amor]] an album with the  lead single being a [[duet]] with [[Ana Gabriel]] of the same name. The track earned awards such as a [[Lo Nuestro Awards]] for [[Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year|Best Pop Song]] and the Single of the Year mention by the [[Radio & Records|Radio y M\u00fasica]] journal.\n\nBy the early to mid 90's, the torch for Mexican music was carried by another [[Mexican-American]] singer who had grown up speaking English and learned Spanish as a second language. Texas-born [[Selena Quintanilla Perez|Selena]] was a [[Grammy Award]] winning [[Tejano (music)|Tejano]] singer, who also sang many genres. After bypassing all the Tejano barriors{{typo help inline|reason=similar to barriers|date=November 2019}}, she quickly earned the title \"Queen of Tejano Music.\" Selena became the first Latin artist to have four number ones in one year in 1994. The four were [[Donde Quiera Que Est\u00e9s]], [[Amor Prohibido (song)|Amor Prohibido]], [[Bidi Bidi Bom Bom]] and [[No Me Queda Mas]]. After her success in Spanish and winning a Grammy Award, Selena went to work on her very first English album. The irony was that English was Selena's first language, as she had grown up in Texas and Spanish was actually her ''second'' language. Sadly, Selena was murdered in March 1995.\n\n[[File:Luismiguelcomplices2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Luis Miguel]] \"El sol de Mexico\" (The Sun of Mexico) in [[Mexico city]].]]\n\nSelena only recorded 4 songs for her [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] album and was scheduled to have 13 songs in English for her album. The crossover album titled [[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]] was released in the summer of 1995. It quickly became an International Success. Selena's songs [[Dreaming of You (Selena song)|Dreaming of You]] and [[I Could Fall In Love]] quickly became crossover hits on American English language Top-40 and Adult Contemporary radio stations, with the single \"Dreaming of You\" also certified Gold. The album became among the \"Top ten best-selling debuts of all time\" along with being the \"Best-selling debuts for a Lat\u00edn Female artist.\" Selena became the first Latin Artist, male or female, to have ever debuted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200]] all-genres album chart. This career achievement helped create the Lat\u00edn boom in the late 90's\n\n[[File:Thal\u00eda in concert2.jpg|thumb|upright|Thal\u00eda rose to fame as a member of the musical group Timbiriche.]]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Ricky Martin's success in Europe with the hit ''[[Mar\u00eda (Ricky Martin song)|Mar\u00eda]]'' and the international launch of [[1998 World Cup]]'s theme song, ''[[The Cup of Life]]'', and [[Enrique iglesias]] success launched a renewed interest in Latin American music. Mexican pop music started to look attractive to international markets.\n\nThe most successful Mexican singer of the 1990s was [[Luis Miguel]]. Best known for his technically skilled and smooth crooning vocals, Luis Miguel's super-stardom began since the late 1980s. In 1991, his career went to even greater heights and earned him the respect of a wider audience with the release of ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'', an album of romantic [[bolero]]s. Most of them were from the 1940s and 1950s. Despite singing boleros from years past, Luis Miguel was recognized for reinventing the bolero for modern audiences. The album ''Romance'', which became his most successful album ever, eventually sold 15 million units worldwide. Luis Miguel has successfully performed [[pop music]], bolero, [[mariachi]] and romantic ballads. He has won four [[Latin Grammy Awards]], five [[Grammy Awards]], and has sold an estimate of 90 million albums until today. He is known in Latin America and Spain as \"El Sol de M\u00e9xico\" (The Sun of Mexico).\n\n[[Image:Paulina2014.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Paulina Rubio]] rose to fame as a member of the musical group Timbiriche.]]\n\n[[Thal\u00eda]] often referred to as the \"Queen of Latin Pop\"\nTelevisa has exported media to many countries. This has allowed Mexican actors to take advantage of their popularity to launch music careers in countries where Televisa [[telenovela]]s are popular. Some examples of these actors are Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, [[Ver\u00f3nica Castro]] and [[Guillermo Capetillo]]. Ver\u00f3nica's son, [[Cristian Castro]], started his career around this time and became popular throughout Latin America.\n\nThe most successful singer to combine [[ranchera]], [[mariachi]] and [[pop music]] was [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. He originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music. However, his later work was focused on mainstream pop music.\n\nSingers such as [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Gloria Trevi]], and [[Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula]] have also produced songs that combine traditional Mexican music with popular music. The Mexican pop singers who were very successful in Mexico and the rest of North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia are [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Paulina Rubio]].\n\nThe idea of creating a pop band after a telenovela was first explored in 1991 with the cast of [[Mu\u00f1ecos de Papel]] (With [[Ricky Martin]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Rivera]], and former Timbiriche members [[Sasha Sokol]] and [[Erik Rubin]]). In 1999, the same formula was explored with the telenovela [[DKDA]] with Alessandra Rossaldo (then member of [[Sentidos Opuestos]]), [[Patricio Borghetti]] and [[Ernesto D'Alessio]]. This formula would be explored again in 2004 with the creation of the most successful group in Latinamerica [[RBD]].\n\n==2000s and 2010s==\n[[Image:Natalia Lafourcade 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Natalia Lafourcade]] since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in the pop rock scene in Latin America.]]\n\nIn 2000, Gloria Trevi, Andrade, and backup singer Maria Raquenel Portillo were arrested in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on charges of corrupting minors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/14/world/mexican-star-in-sex-case-is-arrested-in-rio.html Mexican Star in Sex Case Is Arrested in Rio]</ref><ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-12-23-trevi_x.htm Prosecutor wants charges against Trevi]</ref> Trevi was cleared of the charges in 2004, due to lack of evidence, after spending four years and eight months in prison.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/23/artsnews.mexico Mexico's Madonna free at last in climax to real-life soap]</ref>\n\nThe century saw new groups [[Sin Bandera]], [[RBD]], [[Belanova]], [[Playa Limbo]], and [[Jotdog]] as well as new and solo debut singers like [[Dulce Maria]], [[Anah\u00ed]], [[Belinda (entertainer)|Belinda]], [[Maite Perroni]], [[Julieta Venegas]], [[Ximena Sari\u00f1ana]] and [[Kika Edgar]].

The plot is about a female surgeon who pretends to be a nurse so she can serve on the front line during [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/632/Army-Surgeon/articles.html Frank Miller, \"Army Wives\", at ''Turner Classic Movies''] accessed 12 Oct 2014</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with an elderly Dr. Elizabeth Ainsley ([[Jane Wyatt]]) in her cabin on a military boat.  While going through an old box she comes across an old photo of her and two men dated 1917.  The scene then flashes back to her getting off a boat in France where we find that she has lied about her occupation so that she can be assigned as a nurse to a WWI French army hospital to work alongside Capt. James 'Jim' Mason ([[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]]).\n\nWhen Dr. Ainsley arrives she finds that Dr. Mason does not understand why they sent her there because he had asked for a male nurse. She replies that it is routine and says that she is trained in shrapnel and the brain. When some wounded men come in Dr. Mason tells her to get ready and he also says he will find out if she knows anything or not. Several scenes show them working well together with her still posing as a nurse. Dr. Mason is disappointed that they are not able to save more lives and she reassures him that they are doing their best and it is not his fault.  That night she is having a nightmare and he wakes her up and also reveals that he knows she is a doctor but will not report her.\n\nDr. Mason wants to establish a hospital at the front lines but Col. John Wishart ([[George Cleveland]]) won't let him due to Army regulations. Doctor Ainsley convinces him to let Dr. Mason establish a hospital but not to let Dr. Mason know they have talked.\n\nDr. Mason tells them to pack their belongings because he reassigned to the front lines. When they get there they start to get more victims then they can handle. One day Dr. Mason and Dr. Ainsley are working in the vegetable garden when enemy planes fly over but an American plane comes out of nowhere and starts to shoot them down. But before he can get them all he is shot down. Dr. Ainsley and Dr. Mason run to his aid and get him out of the plane alive at which time Dr. Ainsley recognizes him as Lt. Philip 'Phil' Harvey ([[Kent Taylor]]) who she had a previous relationship. Dr. Ainsley  tells Dr. Mason  that Lt. Harvey is nothing to her and there is nothing between them. Dr. Drake (Walter Reed) tells Dr.Mason he is jealous.  Lt. Harvey tries to revive their romance and she discourages them. While he is kissing her against her will Dr. Mason walks in on them and tells Lt. Harvey he is recommending that he is ready to return to active duty.\n\nAt Christmas they find the best tree they can find and decorate it. The patients and staff give Dr Ainsley a homemade present for their gratitude and as she is thanking them when a man walks in and says special delivery by airplane for Miss Ainsley and it is flowers that Lt. Harvey dropped for her.  This irritates Dr. Mason and she changes the subject by playing Christmas music and they exchange a loving look.  The festivities are interrupted by an influx of casualties and Dr. Drake is killed.\n\nOne day on her way to take papers to Col. John Wishart she lets it slip that she had spoken to him about being reassigned to the front and Dr. Mason is not happy about it. On her way out a Major orders her to take a leave and she runs into Lt. Harvey and they decide to go to lunch. Lt. Harvey gets to the cafe first and findsd Dr. Mason playing the piano. Lt. Harvey tells him to get out and Dr.Mason tells Harvey that if he wants to fight there is an alley out back. Harvey tells Dr. Mason that if he wins he can have Miss Ainsley but Dr. Mason says Ainsley means nothing to him and he is just fighting a war. Dr. Ainsley overhears and says, \"Never mind, Phil, it is not fair to take up any more of the Captain's time\". They go on a hayride and Dr. Ainsley tells Lt. Harvey she is not interested in reviving their romance. They are then contacted that they need to get back to the front.\n\nOnce there, Dr. Mason tells them they are being evacuated and tells Dr. Ainsley to leave with the rest of them but she refuses. He picks her up to carry her out to a car when a hill of dirt caves in trapping them and Lt. Harvey along with several patients. Mason and Harvey eventually dig their way out only to find that they are behind enemy lines. They flip a coin to see who will go for help and  Dr. Mason wins only to get shot and brought back into the hut. Their aide, Brooklyn ([[James Burke (actor)|James Burke]]) shows up and tells them that the army has driven the enemy back.  While in the hospital, Dr. Mason, Dr. Ainsley, and Lt. Harvey all hold hands.\n\nFlash back to the present and Dr. Mason walks into the cabin indicating that they are married and he sees her holding a picture of the three of them. He says that the picture reminds him of a letter he forgot about that is from Harvey. She opens it and reads from Harvey: \"Now don't tell me I have gotta go through all that again.\" and in the note it says that he is now married.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]]  as Capt.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until\u00a0 the last few months of the\u00a0 war\u00a0 when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a\u00a0 francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17 hard fought Battle Honours at a cost\u00a0 of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.
