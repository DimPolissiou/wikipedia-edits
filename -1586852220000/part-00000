Whitaker once said in three years, he would only broadcast three innings because CBS would not switch away from Dizzy Dean. However, he said that he learned a lot of baseball just sitting next to Frisch. CBS had other backup crews for games featuring the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]], [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]].

Each team could also cut its own deal with broadcast and cable television channels and radio stations to serve as their local broadcasters (for example, the [[New York Yankees]] signed a cable deal with [[MSG (TV network)|MSG]] that would pay the team $41 million annually for 12 years).

To put things into proper perspective, two weeks prior to the announcement of the baseball deal with CBS, NBC had committed itself to paying $401 million for U.S. broadcast rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the baseball deal was announced, some skeptics surmised that CBS had lowballed the Barcelona bidding so that it would have at least $1 billion to spend on baseball.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, neither NBC nor ABC wanted the entire baseball package\u2014that is, regular-season games, both League Championship Series and the World Series\u2014because such a commitment would require them to preempt too many highly rated prime time shows. Thus, ABC and NBC bid thinking that two of the networks might share postseason play again or that one of the championship series might wind up on cable. Peter Ueberroth had encouraged the cable idea, but after the bids were opened, NBC and ABC found to their chagrin that he preferred network exposure for all postseason games.

Though O'Brien would be joined in 1993 by co-host [[Andrea Joyce]] during the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] and [[1993 World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe network used the slogan \"Baseball's biggest moments are on CBS!\" to promote its regular season ''Game of the Week'' broadcasts.<ref>{{YouTube|title=1991 Commercials |id=Ty6XIevZjDY}}</ref> This was especially considerate because 1990 would mark the first time since [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975]] (NBC) that a single network presented the complete Major League Baseball package nationwide. The pre-game shows were titled ''Baseball'', with the corresponding season tagged at the end (such as ''Baseball '90'' and ''Baseball '91'') for each year.\n\n=====Other music=====\nFor Pat O'Brien's prologue for Game 4 of the [[1990 National League Championship Series]], between the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] and [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], CBS used [[David Arkenstone]]'s \"[[Island (David Arkenstone album)|Desert Ride]]\", which would subsequently be used during [[Bob Costas]]' prologue for [[NBA on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of Game 6 of the [[1993 NBA Finals]] between the [[1992\u201393 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] and [[1992\u201393 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]].\n\nDuring the closing credits of CBS' coverage of Game 4 of the [[1990 World Series]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1990 World Series Game 4 Close|id=jOGI83QZcuU}}</ref> (after the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] swept the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]), CBS used [[James Horner]]'s score from the end credits of the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]''.\n\nA recurring theme during CBS' coverage of the postseason was the usage of [[Michael Kamen]]'s \"Overture\" from ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''. From start to finish, an audio montage of baseball's most memorable moments played over it, followed by a video and music (with no narration) recap of both [[League Championship Series]] and the World Series from {{wsy|1991}} to {{wsy|1993}}. The \"Training\" cue from ''Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'' was played against an all slow-motion montage of the entire series. As [[Tim McCarver]] recapped the first six games of the 1991 World Series before Game 7, CBS used [[Hans Zimmer]]'s \"Fighting 17th\" from the movie ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' for the soundtrack.\n\nDuring Pat O'Brien's prologue for CBS' coverage of the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]],<ref>{{YouTube|title=1992 All-Star Game \u2013 AL 13, NL 6 \u2013 July 14, 1992 \u2013 CBS-TV \u2013 PART 1|id=67Txs_mC6Ko}}</ref> [[Ennio Morricone]]'s theme from the 1987 film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' was used.

Also during CBS' 1992 ALCS coverage, CBS enlisted the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|cast]] of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' such as [[Big Bird]],<ref>{{YouTube|title=Classic TV: Big Bird opens 1992 ALCS Game 6|id=VHlykLKzFkM}}</ref> [[Oscar the Grouch]] and [[Telly Monster]] to help with the intros.\n\nDuring the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]] and postseason, highlights of past All-Star Games and postseason moments were scored using the [[John Williams]] composed [[Jurassic Park (film score)|theme]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1993 NLCS \u2013 Game 1 \u2013 Braves vs. Phillies @mrodsports|id=-_gb4hGiPoM}}</ref> from the movie ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Also during the commercial breaks of the 1993 All-Star Game, CBS provided a snippet of [[Don Henley]]'s \"[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]\". Van Halen's \"[[Right Now (Van Halen song)|Right Now]]\" was used during the opening for the network's coverage of Game 4 of the [[1993 American League Championship Series]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1993 ALCS Game 4 \u2013 CBS Opening (Chicago @ Toronto)|id=vD0-HOluKag}}</ref> between the [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]].\n\nDuring the prologue for Game 1 of the [[1993 World Series]], CBS used [[Hans Zimmer]]'s \"The Walk Home\" from the movie ''[[Cool Runnings]]''.

Meanwhile, during the closing credits for Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, they used [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Stranger in Town (album)|The Famous Final Scene]]\" followed by [[Billy Joel]]'s \"[[River of Dreams|Famous Last Words]]\".<ref>{{YouTube|title=1993 World Series Game 6 13|id=qjup5qVge-4}}</ref>\n\n====Year-by-year====\nCBS for the most part, bypassed the division and pennant races.

He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' color commentator, [[John Madden]] for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would \"force\" something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said \"Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out.

All in all, the 1989 World Series was at the time, the lowest [[World Series television ratings|rated World Series]] ever.

Regular season telecasts were reduced to a meager handful. In return, pregame shows during the League Championship Series were entirely eliminated, to minimize the ratings damage.\n\nOn [[Sunday Afternoon Baseball|Sunday]], May 5, CBS broadcast games involving [[1991 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] at [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]] (with Jack Buck and Tim McCarver on the call) and [[1991 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] at the [[1991 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] (with Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat on the call). And then on Sunday, July 14, Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat called a game in [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]] between the [[1991 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] and [[1991 California Angels season|California Angels]].\n\nFor CBS' coverage of the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]] from [[Rogers Centre|Toronto]], CBS started their broadcast at the top of the hour with the customary pregame coverage. And then, because [[President of the United States|American President]] [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] were throwing out the first ball, there was a slight delay from the 8:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] start. The game eventually started about 15\u201320 minutes late. Presumably this, along with CBS' low ratings for baseball, and the costs of doing pregame coverage, led to them starting the prime time broadcasts at 8:30 for the final two years of the contract, with little or no pregame content.\n\nThe 1991 season was perhaps most noteworthy for CBS having the opportunity to cover the now legendary [[1991 World Series|World Series]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Hansen|first=Jeff|date=October 21, 1991|title=CBS blinded by baseball's shining moment|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/10/21/CBS-blinded-by-baseballs-shining-moment/8427688017600/|newspaper=UPI|location= |access-date= }}</ref> between the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] and [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].

In an on-air broadcast on September 10, {{MLB Year|2006}} with booth partner [[Ken Singleton]], Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a [[2006 New York Yankees season|Yankee]]\u2013[[2006 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced that he was going to record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] along with Tim McCarver and [[Josh Lewin]]. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived him of doing on the YES Network. In {{MLB Year|2009}}, Kaat joined the recently launched [[MLB Network]] as a color commentator for their ''[[MLB Network Showcase]]'' series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game.

In {{mlby|2008}}, he called the [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|AL Central tiebreaker game]] with Darling and [[Harold Reynolds]], followed by the [[2008 National League Division Series|NLDS]] with Darling and [[Tony Gwynn]]. In {{mlby|2009}}, he teamed with [[Bob Brenly]] to call the [[2009 National League Division Series|NLDS]] for TBS, and the two have worked together for the NLDS every year since until 2014, when TBS began carrying only two LDS, rotating between AL/NL each year. (TBS and Fox began splitting the LDS from 2014 on.) TBS was previously the exclusive home of the LDS from 2007 to 2013.

Baseball got this enormous overbid with CBS, coupled with expanding the cable package (on ESPN) from zero to four nights a week. Now, when they find themselves in trouble, they've got no place to expand. There just wasn't a lot of foresight.

Each team could also cut its own deal with broadcast and cable television channels and radio stations to serve as their local broadcasters (for example, the [[New York Yankees]] signed a cable deal with [[MSG (TV network)|MSG]] that would pay the team $41 million annually for 12 years).

To put things into proper perspective, two weeks prior to the announcement of the baseball deal with CBS, NBC had committed itself to paying $401 million for U.S. broadcast rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the baseball deal was announced, some skeptics surmised that CBS had lowballed the Barcelona bidding so that it would have at least $1 billion to spend on baseball.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, neither NBC nor ABC wanted the entire baseball package\u2014that is, regular-season games, both League Championship Series and the World Series\u2014because such a commitment would require them to preempt too many highly rated prime time shows. Thus, ABC and NBC bid thinking that two of the networks might share postseason play again or that one of the championship series might wind up on cable. Peter Ueberroth had encouraged the cable idea, but after the bids were opened, NBC and ABC found to their chagrin that he preferred network exposure for all postseason games.

Though O'Brien would be joined in 1993 by co-host [[Andrea Joyce]] during the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] and [[1993 World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe network used the slogan \"Baseball's biggest moments are on CBS!\" to promote its regular season ''Game of the Week'' broadcasts.<ref>{{YouTube|title=1991 Commercials |id=Ty6XIevZjDY}}</ref> This was especially considerate because 1990 would mark the first time since [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975]] (NBC) that a single network presented the complete Major League Baseball package nationwide. The pre-game shows were titled ''Baseball'', with the corresponding season tagged at the end (such as ''Baseball '90'' and ''Baseball '91'') for each year.\n\n=====Other music=====\nFor Pat O'Brien's prologue for Game 4 of the [[1990 National League Championship Series]], between the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] and [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], CBS used [[David Arkenstone]]'s \"[[Island (David Arkenstone album)|Desert Ride]]\", which would subsequently be used during [[Bob Costas]]' prologue for [[NBA on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of Game 6 of the [[1993 NBA Finals]] between the [[1992\u201393 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] and [[1992\u201393 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]].\n\nDuring the closing credits of CBS' coverage of Game 4 of the [[1990 World Series]]<ref>{{YouTube|title=1990 World Series Game 4 Close|id=jOGI83QZcuU}}</ref> (after the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] swept the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]), CBS used [[James Horner]]'s score from the end credits of the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]''.\n\nA recurring theme during CBS' coverage of the postseason was the usage of [[Michael Kamen]]'s \"Overture\" from ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]''. From start to finish, an audio montage of baseball's most memorable moments played over it, followed by a video and music (with no narration) recap of both [[League Championship Series]] and the World Series from {{wsy|1991}} to {{wsy|1993}}. The \"Training\" cue from ''Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'' was played against an all slow-motion montage of the entire series.

He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead ''[[NFL on CBS]]'' color commentator, [[John Madden]] for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would \"force\" something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said \"Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out.

This was below the levels of the playoffs the year before, when they aired on NBC.\n\nWhile the ratings for the 1990 World Series improved to 26.2 compared to [[1989 World Series|1989]], the 1989 Series (which aired on ABC) was interrupted for 10 days by the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]]. All in all, the 1989 World Series was at the time, the lowest [[World Series television ratings|rated World Series]] ever. More to the point, the ratings for the 1990 World Series on CBS were significantly lower than any World Series between [[1982 World Series|1982]] and [[1988 World Series|1988]].\n\nAlthough the 1990 NLCS lasted six games, that year's ALCS and more importantly, the World Series, lasted only four<ref>{{cite book |last=Cashmore|first=Ellis|date= |title=And There Was Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MGIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Major+League+Baseball+on+CBS&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qOHqVKzoLsrUoATO1ICIDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20CBS&f=false|location= |publisher= |page=146|isbn= |access-date= }}</ref> out of seven possible games. To put things into proper perspective, by one estimate, CBS lost $5 million for each playoff game not played and US$15.4 million for each World Series game not played.

Regular season telecasts were reduced to a meager handful. In return, pregame shows during the League Championship Series were entirely eliminated, to minimize the ratings damage.\n\nOn [[Sunday Afternoon Baseball|Sunday]], May 5, CBS broadcast games involving [[1991 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] at [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]] (with Jack Buck and Tim McCarver on the call) and [[1991 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] at the [[1991 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] (with Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat on the call). And then on Sunday, July 14, Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat called a game in [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim]] between the [[1991 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] and [[1991 California Angels season|California Angels]].\n\nFor CBS' coverage of the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]] from [[Rogers Centre|Toronto]], CBS started their broadcast at the top of the hour with the customary pregame coverage. And then, because [[President of the United States|American President]] [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] were throwing out the first ball, there was a slight delay from the 8:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] start. The game eventually started about 15\u201320 minutes late. Presumably this, along with CBS' low ratings for baseball, and the costs of doing pregame coverage, led to them starting the prime time broadcasts at 8:30 for the final two years of the contract, with little or no pregame content.\n\nThe 1991 season was perhaps most noteworthy for CBS having the opportunity to cover the now legendary [[1991 World Series|World Series]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Hansen|first=Jeff|date=October 21, 1991|title=CBS blinded by baseball's shining moment|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/10/21/CBS-blinded-by-baseballs-shining-moment/8427688017600/|newspaper=UPI|location= |access-date= }}</ref> between the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] and [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].

In an on-air broadcast on September 10, {{MLB Year|2006}} with booth partner [[Ken Singleton]], Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a [[2006 New York Yankees season|Yankee]]\u2013[[2006 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced that he was going to record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] along with Tim McCarver and [[Josh Lewin]]. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived him of doing on the YES Network. In {{MLB Year|2009}}, Kaat joined the recently launched [[MLB Network]] as a color commentator for their ''[[MLB Network Showcase]]'' series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game.

In {{mlby|2008}}, he called the [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|AL Central tiebreaker game]] with Darling and [[Harold Reynolds]], followed by the [[2008 National League Division Series|NLDS]] with Darling and [[Tony Gwynn]]. In {{mlby|2009}}, he teamed with [[Bob Brenly]] to call the [[2009 National League Division Series|NLDS]] for TBS, and the two have worked together for the NLDS every year since until 2014, when TBS began carrying only two LDS, rotating between AL/NL each year. (TBS and Fox began splitting the LDS from 2014 on.) TBS was previously the exclusive home of the LDS from 2007 to 2013.

Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]]. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.<ref name=serano>Julia Serano.

These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.<ref>Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C.

Transgender people of color are more significantly associated with depression than their white counterparts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prevention.ucsf.edu/uploads/pubs/presentations/pdf/APHA_Nemoto.pdf|title=Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color|work=Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco|date=November 2004}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transgender}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20}}\n* [[Discrimination against non-binary gender people]]\n* [[GATE (organization)|GATE]]\n* [[Hate crime]]\n* [[Corrective rape]]\n* [[LGBT people in prison]]\n* [[List of transgender-related topics]]\n* [[List of people killed for being transgender]]\n* [[Press for Change]] \u2013 UK law organisation for transgender people\n* [[Transgender Day of Remembrance]]\n* [[Transgender Europe]]\n* [[Transgender inequality]]\n* [[Transgender Law Center]]\n* [[Transmisogyny]]\n* [[Trans panic defense]] \u2013 a legal defense for assault or murder where the victim is trans.\n* [[Yogyakarta Principles]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Goldberg\">{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Michelle|title=What Is a Woman?|journal=The New Yorker|date=August 4, 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Raymond 1994\">{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=J.|year=1994|title=The Transsexual Empire|publisher=Teachers College Press|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n<!--  <ref name=\"hp-what-is-terf\">{{Cite web|title = Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism: What Exactly Is It, And Why Does It Hurt?|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kelsie-brynn-jones/transexclusionary-radical-terf_b_5632332.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-24|date = 2014-08-02}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"raymond-fictions-and-facts\">{{cite web | url=http://janiceraymond.com/fictions-and-facts-about-the-transsexual-empire/ | title=Fictions and Facts About the Transsexual Empire | author=Janice Raymond | quote=The NCHCT took these submissions and published a report on \"Transsexual Surgery\" in its 1981 Assessment Report Series.

Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]]. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.<ref name=serano>Julia Serano.

These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.<ref>Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C.

It is their position that God created people's bodies as they are meant to be, that accepting transgender people would violate scripture and [[natural law]], and that the Bible refers to male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A5&version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Deuteronomy 22:5 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under [[Pope John Paul II]], the [[Holy See]] first stated its opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made public until 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu15.htm|title=Catholic beliefs about the causes & cures of transsexuality|accessdate=7 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nTransgender people face particular challenges in attempting to integrate their faith with their gender identity.

Transgender men and women are acknowledged and accepted in many Islamic cultures around the world. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1988, gender reassignment surgery was declared acceptable under Islamic law by scholars at Egypt's Al-Azhar, the world's oldest Islamic university. In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see [[transgender rights in Iran]]). The foundation for this accepting attitude is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual, thus making homosexuality a sin.

Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=J.|date=|title=The Center for Collegiate Mental Health: Practice and research working together |journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=|pages=101\u2013104|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Effrig|first=Jessica C.|last2=Bieschke|first2=Kathleen J.|last3=Locke|first3=Benjamin D.|date=2011-09-01|title=Examining Victimization and Psychological Distress in Transgender College Students|journal=Journal of College Counseling|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=143\u2013157|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x|issn=2161-1882}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%.

{"title_page": "Combination Game", "text_new": "The '''Combination Game''' was a style of [[association football]] based around teamwork and cooperation. It would gradually favour the [[Passing (association football)|passing of the ball]] between players over individual dribbling skills which had been a notable feature of early Association games.  It developed from \"scientific\" [[Association football|football]] and is considered to be the predecessor of the modern passing game of football.  It originated in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and its origins are associated with early clubs: [[Sheffield FC]] (founded 1857), The [[Royal Engineers AFC]] (founded 1863), [[Queen's Park FC]] (founded 1867) and [[Cambridge University AFC]] (founded 1856).  Each of these claimants is supported by ''retrospective'' accounts from men who were notable in the early history of football.  They are considered below in the order of earliest ''contemporary'' evidence of \"scientific\" football playing styles.\n\n==Background==\n\n===The effect of rule changes on playing style===\nSee [[Offside (association football)]]\n\nThe change to the original offside rule enabled the gradual transition from a dribbling to a passing game. The introduction of a loose offside rule in the FA rules of 1866/67 - at the behest of representatives of [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]] and [[Westminster School]]<ref>Marples, Morris (1954) ''A History of Football'', Secker and Warburg, London]</ref><ref>CW Alcock, \"Association Football\", in the ''English Illustrated Magazine'', 1891, page 283</ref> - opened the way to forward passing. A similar rule had originally been part of the earlier [[Cambridge rules]].<ref name=\"corshamref\">[http://www.corshamref.org.uk/offhist.htm The History of Offside] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330052703/http://www.corshamref.org.uk/offhist.htm |date=30 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===C. W. Alcock===\n\nThe earliest reference to the term \"combination game\" is made by [[C. W. Alcock]] in 1874 when he states that \"Nothing succeeds better than what I may call a 'combination game'.\"<ref name=\"Football: our winter game\">\"Football: our winter game\", Charles Alcock, London, 1874</ref> Alcock is referring to an early system of cooperation known as 'backing up' which he defines as a... \"process of following closely on a fellow player, to assist him if required, and to take the ball if he be attacked or prevented from continuing his onward course.\"<ref>\"Football: our winter game\", Charles Alcock, London, 1874, p. 83</ref> Although a keen dribbler, Alcock is notable as being the first footballer ever to be ruled offside on 31 March 1866, confirming that players were probing ways of exploiting the new offside rule right from the start.<ref name=corshamref/> As early as 1870 Alcock stated that he preferred playing football in a \"scientific\" way.<ref>Charles W Alcock, ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, 28 November 1870, page 7</ref>  An example of this was reported in a contemporary account of the [[England v Scotland (1870)|November 1870 football match between England and Scotland]] \"Mr Alcock made a splendid run ... and being cleverly supported by Mr Walker, a goal was obtained ... by the latter\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 26 November 1870</ref>  A further contemporary reference shows that Alcock himself was playing \"in concert\" with his teammates during [[England v Scotland (1871)|the 1871 international match between England and Scotland]]:\n\n{{Quote|indeed it seemed as if the [Scottish] defence would prove more than equal to the attack until a well executed run down by C W Alcock, [[William C. Butler|WC Butler]] and [[Robert Sandilands Frowd Walker|RSF Walker]], acting in concert, enabled the last named of the trio to equalise the score by the accomplishment of a well merited goal<ref>''The Scotsman'' newspaper Monday 27 February 1871 page 7</ref>}}\n\nThese examples of cooperation fit in with the system of backing up, which was prevalent in the London Association game during the 1860s and early 1870s. As systematic forms of passing became more prevalent in association football, Alcock's views on combination would understandably change. Writing in 1883 he gives the following definition of combination:\n{{Quote|Combination is the great object to be studied in the attainment of success in Association football. By combination I mean much more than the mere \"passing on\" which seems to be the one common idea of perfection among a large number of English Associationists... The superiority of the Association elevens of Scotland is not to be attributed to a greater skill of their forwards, or to the advantage of back play. It is to their combination - by which I mean the effective way in which they turn every chance of the game to account, never overlooking any one feature however unimportant it may appear of itself - that they owe their successes over English teams.<ref>Alcock, C.W. (ed), The Football Annual, London, 1883, Pp12-13</ref>}} As the game continued to evolve Alcock would state in 1891: \"An Association eleven of to-day is altogether a different machine to what it was even as recently as ten years ago.<ref name=\"Association Football 1891, page 287\">\"Association Football\", chapter by CW Alcock, ''The English Illustrated Magazine'' 1891, page 287</ref>\n\n==Scientific Football (1839 onwards)==\nThe earliest uses of the term \"scientific\" in the context of sport are in the description of the obligatory team game [[cricket]] (1833)<ref>''The Gentleman's Magazine'', July 1833, page 42</ref> The first use of the term \"scientific\" to describe football comes from [[Dragley Beck]], [[Ulverston]], [[Lancashire]] in 1839.  This states:\n\n{{Quote|FOOT-BALL. Last week a match took place in a field near Dragley Beck between the men of leather and the other trades of Ulverstone. The shoemakers &c challenged the other parties, and it was eventually agreed that each side should have 15 men. The ball was placed about the centre of the ground, and one from each side stood twenty yards from it. At a given signal, two opponents rushed forward, and the representative of leather, Roger Gaskell, took the ball in grand style, thereby winning the glaves. The action then became general, but leather was forced to be content with the laurels already won, as the other party won every bye that was played. Many of the gentle craft were good millers, and carried on the contest toughly, but their opponents played more scientifically, and out manoeuvred them, and carried the day in triumph.\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Sunday, 13 January 1839. New Readerships</ref>}}\n\n\"Scientific\" was first used to describe a modern football code in 1862 with reference to [[Rugby football]]:<ref>''Blackwood's Magazine'', Published by W. Blackwood, 1862, page 563</ref> and in 1868 the \"great science\" of rugby football consisted of \"off your side, drop kicks punts, places and the other intricacies\"<ref>''Tom Brown's school days, by an old boy [T. Hughes]''.  By Tom Brown, Thomas Hughes, Old Boy Edition: 55, 1868</ref> It is uncertain what these other intricacies were exactly, however it is, clear that this playing style was more systematic than in the past. References to scientific football come in accounts in the mid-1860s, particularly Sheffield FC (see later). Later contemporary accounts include internationals, for example the [[England v Scotland (1870)|November 1870 association football match between England and Scotland]] which \"was of unusual excellence for the many scientific points it involved\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 26 November 1870, issue 446</ref>  Alcock advocated scientific football as early as 1870 (see below).\n\n==Sheffield FC: Backing up and the \"passing on\" game (mid-1860s and early 1870s)==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Sheffield FC.svg|thumb|Logo of Sheffield F.C. The World's first non-university football club{{ffdc|1=Sheffield FC.svg|log=2015 December 2}}]] -->\n\nAccording to Alcock,<ref name=\"Football: our winter game\"/> Sheffield FA team provides the first evidence of combination, in particular the \"passing on\" of the Sheffield FA team and their [[Sheffield Rules]].  The offside system of the Sheffield rules allowed poaching or sneaking and the forward pass was permitted:  Players known as \"kick throughs\" were positioned permanently near the opponents goal to receive these balls. For this reason the Sheffield style is known as the \"passing on game\".<ref>Adrian Harvey, ''Football The First Hundred Years'', Routledge, 2005, page 213</ref> As early as January 1865 [[Sheffield F.C.]] was associated with scoring a goal through \"scientific movements\" against Nottingham<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday, 7 January 1865; Issue 2,229: \"The Sheffield party, however, eventually took a lead, and through some scientific movements of Mr J Wild, scored a goal amid great cheering\"</ref> A contemporary match report of November 1865 notes \"We cannot help recording the really scientific play with which the Sheffield men backed each other up\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), 26 November 1865, issue 2275</ref> Combination associated with  Sheffield players is also suggested in 1868: \"a remarkably neat and quick piece of play on the part of K Smith, Denton and J Knowles resulted in a goal for Sheffield, the final kick being given by J. Knowles\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 8 February 1868 issue 2390</ref> \n\nContemporary proof of passing occurs from at least January 1872.  In January 1872 the following account is given against Derby:  \"W. Orton, by a specimen of careful play, running the ball up in close proximity to the goal, from which it was returned to J. Marsh, who by a fine straight shot kicked it through\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Derby Mercury'' (Derby, England), Wednesday, 17 January 1872; Issue 8218.</ref>  This play taking place \"in close proximity to the goal\" suggests a short pass and the \"return\" of the ball to Marsh suggests that this was the second of two passes.  This account also goes onto describe other early tactics:  \"This goal was supplemented by one of T.

Creswell]], who having brought it up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 5 November 1870, issue 2</ref>\n\n===Royal Engineers in 1871===\nAlthough brief, contemporary match reports confirm that passing was a regular feature of the Engineers' style.  For example, in a match of February 1871 against [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] it is noted that \"[[Hugh Mitchell (Royal Engineers)|Lieut. Mitchell]] made a fine run down the left, passing the ball to [[Henry Rich (footballer)|Lieut. Rich]], who had run up the centre, and who pinced another [goal]\" <ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 25 February 1871, issue 2, 643</ref> The Engineers used their team playing style with effect against the [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]], a side considered as early as 1870 to be  the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] of football.<ref>\"The Sporting Gazette\" of Saturday 12 March 1870, see account of international match of  5 March 1870</ref>   In a match of March 1871 against Wanderers their victory was due to \"irreproachable organisation\" and in particular that both their attacks and their backing up were both \"so well organised\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 18 March 1871, issue 2, 646</ref>  In November 1871 similar passing tactics are described in a contemporary account of a game against the Wanderers in which two goals were scored through tactical passing: \"[[Morton Betts|Betts]], however, soon seized his opportunity, and by a brilliant run down the left wing turned the ball judiciously to Currie, who as judiciously sent it flying through the strangers' goal in first rate style\"<ref name=\"Bell 1871\">''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 18 November 1871, issue 2, 681</ref> Later in the match it is reported that \"Lieut.

Renny-Tailyour]] who planted it between the posts\"<ref name=\"Bell 1871\"/>  \"Turning\" the ball clearly points to the short pass.\n\n===Royal Engineers in 1872===\nThere is evidence that opponents sometimes adjusted their playing style to counteract the organisation and passing of the Engineers. For example, in February 1872 against [[Westminster school]] a brief contemporary match report states that:  \"The school captain took the precaution of strengthening his backs, deputizing [[Henry Dashwood Sealy-Vidal|HDS Vidal]] to cooperate with [[William Rawson|Rawson]] and Jackson and so well did these three play in concert... they succeeded in defying the... RE forwards\" <ref name=\"Bell 1872\">''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 17 February 1872, issue 2694</ref> What is most notable about this report is that it confirms that the Royal Engineers \"played beautifully together\"<ref name=\"Bell 1872\"/>  That the Engineers were the first side to break the trend of dribbling is shown in a contemporary account of their victory against Crystal Palace in early 1872.  This said that:  \"very little dribbling was displayed\" <ref>\"FOOTBALL.\"  ''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday, 16 March 1872; pg. 8; Issue 2,698. New Readerships.</ref>\n\n===Summary of the Royal Engineers early playing style===\nThe evidence above contains detailed descriptions of passing that are lacking in reports of the [[1872 Scotland v England football match|1872 Glasgow international]].  For example, in a lengthy account ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper makes no mention of passing or combination by the Scottish team and specifically describes the Scottish attacks in terms of dribbling: \"The Scotch now came away with a great rush, [[Robert Leckie (footballer)|Leckie]] and others dribbling the ball so smartly that the English lines were closely besieged and the ball was soon behind\"<ref name=\"Monday 1872, page 6\">''The Scotsman'' - Monday, 2 December 1872, page 6</ref> and \"[[Jerry Weir|Weir]] now had a splendid run for Scotland into the heart of his opponents' territory.<ref name=\"Monday 1872, page 6\"/>\" Although the Scottish team are acknowledged to have worked better together during the first half, this contemporary account acknowledges that in the second half England played similarly: \"During the first half of the game the English team did not work so well together, but in the second half they left nothing to be desired in this respect.<ref name=\"Monday 1872, page 6\"/>\"  The Scotsman concludes that the difference in styles in the first half is the advantage the [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queens' Park]] players had \"through knowing each other's play\" as all came from the same club.  Unlike the 1872 Glasgow international - which was drawn - the contemporary evidence above shows that the Engineers' team playing style benefited their team play by winning games. Similarly, the 5 March 1872 match between Wanderers and Queens park contains no evidence of ball passing.<ref name=\"Bell's Life 2,697\"/>\n\nThe early accounts cited above all confirm that the Engineers were the first club to play a passing game of cooperation and organisation with both their forwards and their defence. Although they could also play rough - as would be expected for an army team - The Engineers are the first side to be considered to play the football \"beautifully\".<ref name=\"Bell 1872\"/>  All of these developments clearly occurred before and independent of the 1872 match between England and Scotland (Queen's Park FC).  It is probable that Queen's Park FC observed the Engineers' passing game during one of their visits to England to participate in the [[1871\u201372 FA Cup]].  Undoubtedly, their representatives in London were well aware of the Sheffield and Engineers' style.\n\n==Queens Park FC, 1867 - 1882: Pioneers of the Modern Passing Game==\nWithin the context of the emerging Association game in Scotland, the late historian and broadcaster [[Bob Crampsey]] compared the role of the Queen's Park club with that of the MCC in Cricket and the [[R&A]] Club in Golf.  The Glasgow club's control of the early playing rules in Scotland, early management of the Scotland national team, and instigation of the [[Scottish Football Association]] and [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] provide evidence of their status as the \u2018Premier\u2019 or \u2018Senior\u2019 club of Scotland.  Within this context, the club's development of a scientific form of combination, which would supersede existing playing styles, should be considered.\n\nThe most obvious outcome from the successful implementation of a football culture is the creation of a \u2018legacy\u2019.  Due to the club's unceasing commitment to promote the game across Scotland, the Queen's Park playing style quickly became a 'Scottish style'.  This playing style was imported into the north and midlands of England during the 1870s and 1880s, by the club itself, by other Scottish clubs, and by an increasing wave of Scottish footballers, who are often referred to by contemporary commentators as '[[Scotch Professors]]', (because of the science of their game). The passing game, as a significant football culture, does not arrive in London until the creation of the London Corinthians in 1882 (in response to Scottish supremacy at international level).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corinthian-casuals.com/clubinfo/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831113911/http://www.corinthian-casuals.com/clubinfo/history.php |archivedate=31 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Between 1872 and 1887 Scotland would win 10 times and lose only twice against England in the annual internationals.  The impact of the Scotch Professors in the midlands and north of England would lead to the legalisation of professionalism in 1885 and the development of league football in 1888.\n\n===The Rules of the Field, 1867===\nOn 9 August 1867, one month after the club's formation, the 'Rules of the Field' were discussed and accepted by the Queen's Park committee.  They were based on the Association rules of the period but the club made a number of changes, the most notable being the offside rule.  In 1866 the FA had moved from a rugby style offside rule preventing the ball from being passed forward to a three-man ruling.  Queen's Park would adopt an even more radical approach, which by its design, would open up the game even more to the forward pass. The rule was recorded as follows,\n\n{{Quote|Sixth.\u2014When a player has kicked the ball, any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponents' goal-line is out of play, and may not touch the ball himself, nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so, until the ball has been played, unless there are at least two of his opponents between him and their own goal, who must not be more than fifteen yards from the goal-line; but no player is out of play when the ball is kicked from behind the goal-line.<ref>Robinson, R; ''History of the Queen's Park Football Club'', 1867-1917, Glasgow 1920. P72</ref>}}\n\nOffside only came into being 15 yards from the goal and even then only two defenders were required to be goal side for a player to be onside. The openness of the rule allowed players to be deployed across the field and encouraged the forward pass. In some respects the rule has similarity to the [[Sheffield Rules]] in that it enabled the long forward pass but, unlike the Sheffield code, it also prevented players from poaching or sneaking in front of goal. This carefully considered adaptation of the offside rule demonstrates the meticulous planning and organisation behind the club. It would win the club many admirers including [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], 'Father of the Football League', who pays the following tribute,\n\n{{Quote|Queen\u2019s Park were the first team to develop scientific play. The club must be regarded as a striking example of what good management can accomplish.<ref>Chapter by William McGregor on Queen's Park FC, in Gibson A. and Pickford W. (eds); ''Association Football and the Men Who Made It'', Vol IV, London 1906, P15''</ref>}}\n\nAlthough the game of the late 1860s was rudimentary, the basis for the club's playing style, and the men who would make it happen, all date from this early period.  From this era the passing game of Queen's Park would evolve from simplistic to systematic forms of combination which would be copied throughout Scotland and the UK.\n\n===Regular practice and instruction, 1868 - 1872===\nAt a time when matches against other clubs were difficult to arrange, Queen's Park played internal matches dividing up its membership.  As [[Richard Robinson (writer)|Richard Robinson]] in his early history of the club explains regular practice and instruction, key elements of the combination game, were already being undertaken.\n\n{{Quote|Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays were fixed upon as the nights for play\u2026Whoever selected the teams on practising nights had the power to place their men on the field, or appoint substitutes, and the players shall be bound to adhere to their instructions.<ref>Robinson, R; ''History of the Queen's Park Football Club'', 1867-1917, Glasgow, 1920, P25.</ref>}}\n\n[[Robert Gardner (footballer)|Robert Gardner]] (who captained and picked the Scotland team in the first official international match), as captain of the club, had a profound influence over tactics and team selections. In the match against Hamilton Gymnasium on 29 May 1869 he distributed cards to his team before the match showing each man where he must play.<ref>Quoted in Sanders, R; ''Beastly Fury, The Strange Birth of British Football'', London, 2009, P69.</ref> According to Robinson it was the regular practise games that enabled Queen's Park to develop their brand of combination football.\n\n{{Quote|The club... never neglected practice, and this practice was indulged in systematically. Sides were arranged\u2014 North v. South of Eglinton Toll, Reds v. Blues, Light v. Heavy Weights, President's Team v. J. Smith's Team (a series of six games), and Clerks v. The Field, etc. In these games the dribbling and passing, which raised the Scottish game to the level of a fine art, were developed. Dribbling was a characteristic of English play, and it was not until very much later that the Southerners came to see that the principles laid down in the Queen's Park method of transference of the ball, accompanied by strong backing up, were those which got the most out of a team. Combination was the chief characteristic of the Queen's Park play.<ref>Robinson, R; ''History of the Queen's Park Football Club'', 1867-1917, Glasgow, 1920, P37.</ref>}}\n\n===Queen's Park and 2-2-6 formation, 1872===\nCombination was very much in evidence in both the FA Cup tie against the Wanderers (5 March 1872) and in the international match against England (30 November 1872). In both games the club lined up in a 2-2-6 formation which would be their preferred line up for the remainder of the decade.  In the international match Queen's Park organised the game and provided all of the Scotland players from within its own membership.  The club would form the backbone of the Scotland national team throughout the 1870s and well into the 1880s.  The tactic of combination was certainly successful in combating the superior weight and strength of the opposing players. In the game against Wanderers, the ''Field'' magazine wrote of Queen's Park,\n\n{{Quote|They dribble little and usually convey the ball by a series of long kicks, combined with a judicious plan of passing on.<ref name=\"Sanders, R 2009, P66\">Quoted in Sanders, R; ''Beastly Fury, The Strange Birth of British Football'', London, 2009, P66.</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Herald'', in the same game noted that,\n\n{{Quote|The play of the Glasgow 11 was most creditable, as their forwards worked well together, and their backs kicked with great accuracy. On the other hand, the Wanderers dribbled and played skilfully....but collectively they hardly showed so well as their antagonists.<ref name=\"Sanders, R 2009, P66\"/>}}\n\nIn the first official international match, the first specific reference to a collective passing culture is recorded within the history of Association football. The earliest contemporary reference, dating from 14 December 1872, appears in ''The Graphic'', a weekly illustrated newspaper published in London, and gives clear detail as to the opposing playing styles of the two teams:\n\n{{Quote|Individual skill was generally on England's side, the dribbling of Kirke Smith, Brockbank, and Ottaway being very fine, while Welch, half-back, showed himself a safe and good kick. The Southrons, however, did not play to each other so well as their opponents, who seem to be '''adepts in passing the ball'''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Graphic'' illustrated newspaper, 14 December 1872</ref>}}\n\nTestament to the combination style of football adopted by Queen's Park in the game is given in an eyewitness account by [[Walter Arnott]], who would himself become a leading player for Queen's Park, [[Corinthians]] and Scotland during the 1880s and early 1890s.  Arnott gives a clear description of the historic event at which he was present as a spectator.  Once again the difference in weight is mentioned,\n\n{{Quote|The English team was by far the heavier one. Their forwards played an individual game, and were much faster than those on the Scottish side, whose forward work was done in pairs. What a treat it was to see Clegg or Ottaway getting their ball near their own goal, and making off at a great pace down the field, and only being robbed of it by someone in the last line of the Scottish defence! Then, again, to watch the great [[Jamie Weir]] \u2013 the prince of dribblers \u2013 and his partner, by splendid combined play rushing down the wing and centring the ball with great accuracy right into the goal-mouth.<ref>Chapter by Walter Arnott, in Gibson A. and Pickford W. (eds); ''Association Football and the Men Who Made It'', Vol IV, London, 1906, P22''</ref>}}\n\nIt would appear that the Queen's Park players, unable to match their opponents individually for strength, paired up to stop the dribbling runs of the England players when defending their own goal and played short passes on the run when attacking their opponent's goal.  References alluding to the fact that the Scotland players 'worked from first to last well together, through knowing each other's play' can be found in the Scotsman.<ref>''The Scotsman'' newspaper, 2 December 1872</ref> while the ''Glasgow Herald'' comments that, \"The strong point of the home club was that they played excellently well together.\"<ref>''Glasgow Herald'' newspaper, 2 December 1872</ref>\n\n===Creating a Scottish style===\nQueen's Park took their brand of football to other parts of Scotland, arranging exhibition matches in Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh and Dundee.  The game that they promoted was quite different from the 'backing up' style of the Royal Engineers and the 'passing on' game of Sheffield.  In a match against [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]], played in February 1873, the Glasgow club's systematic form of passing is highlighted in the match report,\n\n{{Quote|Shortly before time was called the Queen's Park came away in fine style, and drove their opponents before them - Messrs Gardner, Leckie, Wotherspoon, Taylor and M'Kinnon working beautifully to each other's feet.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'' newspaper, 17 February 1873</ref>}}\n\nTheir passing game became a Scottish style which was distinctive from other parts of the UK.  An early example of other Scottish clubs emulating the passing style and 2-2-6 formation of Queen's Park can be found in January 1874.  The ''Glasgow Herald'''s report on the match between the [[Third Lanark A.C.|3rd Lanark]] and [[Western F.C.|Western]] clubs states,\n\n{{Quote|On ends being changed, the 3rd men, who were smarting from the unexpected turn of luck, very soon got to work in earnest, and M'Neil, taking the ball in tow up his side of the ground, passed it beautifully to Dick, who was in waiting and who in turn passed it very judiciously to Miller, who kicked a very pretty goal.  No better sample of the passing game could be desired than that shown in the taking of this goal; and as in this case, when combined with good dribbling, it has a telling effect and ought to be the principle study of all Association players.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'' newspaper, 20 January 1874</ref>}}\n\n===Dribbling and Passing===\nThe argument contained within the [[Royal Engineers]] section which opposes the Scottish view of the first international match focuses on the contemporary ''Scotsman'' newspaper article which gives reference to Scottish players dribbling the ball. The Scottish argument, however, contends that the playing style of the Queen's Park players, throughout the 1870s, accommodated both [[dribbling]] and passing.  The evidence is certainly plentiful. This can be seen in [[The Graphic]] newspaper article which on the one hand refers to the Scottish team as being adept at passing the ball but on the other also presents evidence of Scottish players dribbling the ball,\n\n{{Quote|Let it suffice to say that Ker (Scotland) closed the match by the most brilliant run of the day, dribbling the ball past the whole field close on the English lines before he was stopped...<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nIn short, the playing tactics of Queen's Park FC allowed for the ball to be passed when possession was about to be lost or when a greater advantage could be attained; the dribble forward was augmented with a short pass to a teammate.\n\nWriting in the ''[[Football Annual]]'' in 1883, [[Charles W. Alcock]] observed that,\n\n{{Quote|It has been the combination of '''dribbling and passing''' that has made the Queen's Park and other Scotch elevens such splendid teams.<ref>Alcock, C.W. (ed), The Football Annual, London, 1883, P12</ref>}}\n\nTellingly C.W. Alcock, the FA's most influential administrator during the 1860s and 1870s, makes no reference in any of his numerous articles to the role of the Royal Engineers in developing a passing game. This confirms that the backing up system of the Engineers did not involve systematic passing.\n\nIn contrast to this, the newspaper article which features Queen's Park's victory over Wanderers in October 1875 (a match in which C.W. Alcock and the Anglo Scot A.F. Kinnaird played in for Wanderers) gives a concise description of the style of combination adopted by the club, particularly in the section which describes the second and third goals,\n\n{{Quote|After a \u201chand\u201d within thirty yards of the Wanderers\u2019 lines, Weir got possession, and, successfully charging the English forwards, passed it on to Herriot, who in turn placed it to Campbell, who by a well judged kick dropped the ball just below the bar, thus securing another goal for the Scotsmen in sixteen minutes. No sooner had the English captain started the ball than Herriot, Weir and Lawrie, by neat passing sent it back, and after the backs and half backs had shown good play, the two M'Neills brought it along the left side, and passing it to Lawrie, the latter made a shot for goal, but the ball passed just outside the goal post. The play was now in the centre, the Queen\u2019s Park men '''dribbling and passing''', while their opponents indulged chiefly in heavy kicking. In 33 minutes from the commencement of operations H. M'Neill, obtaining possession, kicked the ball to Herriot, who unselfishly serving it to Lawrie, the latter again made a shot for goal, this time with more success, as the ball, passing above the goalkeeper\u2019s head, went clean through thus obtaining the third goal.}}\n\n===The passing game and Scottish supremacy===\nIn the south east of England as the coordinated system of 'backing up' began to decline, the systematic passing game of Queen's Park would eventually win through. It was England's 5-1 defeat in 1882 to a Scotland team featuring seven Queen's Park players which led to [[Nicholas Lane Jackson]], a prominent member of the FA, creating the famous [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]] team. This direct reaction to the success of Queen's Park and the Scotland national team is quoted in the book ''Corinthians and Cricketers'',\n\n{{Quote|It would not be wrong to claim for Queen's Park the building of Scottish football almost single-handed.... It has wielded a profound influence in fashioning the technique of the game, and its development of scientific passing and cohesion between the half-backs and the forwards as a counter to the traditional dribbling and individuality...During those barren years England's teams consisted of amateur players from many different clubs...who had to combine their individuality without any pre-match knowledge of each other's play...Not surprisingly, England failed to beat an enemy nurtured on scientific combination. This position might have continued much longer until the flood tide of professionalism had its inevitable effect; but one of the most industrious and enthusiastic of the game's earliest legislators, N. Lane ('Pa') Jackson, who was then honorary assistant secretary of The Football Association, sought a more immediate solution. 'At that period', he has recorded for us in his autobiography, Sporting Days and Sporting Ways, 'public school and university men provided most of the players for the English side, so I thought that by giving them plenty of practice together they would acquire a certain measure of combination.<ref>Grayson. E.; ''Corinthians and Cricketers, and towards a new sporting era'', London, 1957</ref>}}\n\nThe rudimentary 'passing on' game of Sheffield could not compete with the scientific short passing style championed by Queen's Park and at representative level the [[Glasgow Football Association|Glasgow FA]] would experience 14 wins and only one defeat against the [[Sheffield Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in the 17 fixtures played between 1874 and 1890. A good example of the difference in playing styles is cited in the Scottish Football Annual of 1877/78 which gives the following comments on the Glasgow v Sheffield match of 1877,\n\n{{Quote|That the game was a very well contested one, and victory has rested with the best side, no one will deny; but that it was a pretty game, abounding in fine displays of combined dribbling, which has frequently distinguished a Scottish team above all others, few will admit\u2026The fact cannot be hidden\u2026that the tactics pursued by the Sheffield team on Saturday were partially responsible for this inasmuch as they play a different set of rules from those of the English and Scottish Associations, and to them our \u201coff-side\u201d rule is next to a dead letter. In this manner, long kicking was largely indulged in on Saturday on their side; and in order to meet the same style of play, the Glasgow men actually lost that united action which had led them on to victory in many a harder fought field.<ref>Scottish Football Annual, 1877/78, Glasgow, 1877</ref>}}\n\n===Legacy of the Scottish combination game===\nQueen's Park's combination game, which had emerged as a general \u2018Scottish style\u2019 due to the club's high standing and her energetic promotion of the game, would spread south of the border, to the north and midlands of England, through the efforts of the club and with the arrival of the [[Scotch Professors]]. [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], the Father of the Football League and president of [[Aston Villa FC]], pays the following tribute,\n\n{{Quote|...their missionary visits to the Midlands and Lancashire did much to create a true love for Association football in those districts and also to give a tone and polish to local football effort.

It would gradually favour the [[Passing (association football)|passing of the ball]] between players over individual dribbling skills which had been a notable feature of early Association games.  It developed from \"scientific\" [[Association football|football]] and is considered to be the predecessor of the modern passing game of football.  It originated in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and its origins are associated with early clubs: [[Sheffield FC]] (founded 1857), The [[Royal Engineers AFC]] (founded 1863), [[Queen's Park FC]] (founded 1867) and [[Cambridge University AFC]] (founded 1856).  Each of these claimants is supported by ''retrospective'' accounts from men who were notable in the early history of football.  They are considered below in the order of earliest ''contemporary'' evidence of \"scientific\" football playing styles.\n\n==Background==\n\n===The effect of rule changes on playing style===\nSee [[Offside (association football)]]\n\nThe change to the original offside rule enabled the gradual transition from a dribbling to a passing game.

W. Alcock===\n\nThe earliest reference to the term \"combination game\" is made by [[C. W. Alcock]] in 1874 when he states that \"Nothing succeeds better than what I may call a 'combination game'.\"<ref name=\"Football: our winter game\">\"Football: our winter game\", Charles Alcock, London, 1874</ref> Alcock is referring to an early system of cooperation known as 'backing up' which he defines as a... \"process of following closely on a fellow player, to assist him if required, and to take the ball if he be attacked or prevented from continuing his onward course.\"<ref>\"Football: our winter game\", Charles Alcock, London, 1874, p. 83</ref> Although a keen dribbler, Alcock is notable as being the first footballer ever to be ruled offside on 31 March 1866, confirming that players were probing ways of exploiting the new offside rule right from the start.<ref name=corshamref/> As early as 1870 Alcock stated that he preferred playing football in a \"scientific\" way.<ref>Charles W Alcock, ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, 28 November 1870, page 7</ref>  An example of this was reported in a contemporary account of the [[England v Scotland (1870)|November 1870 football match between England and Scotland]] \"Mr Alcock made a splendid run ... and being cleverly supported by Mr Walker, a goal was obtained ... by the latter\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 26 November 1870</ref>  A further contemporary reference shows that Alcock himself was playing \"in concert\" with his teammates during [[England v Scotland (1871)|the 1871 international match between England and Scotland]]:\n\n{{Quote|indeed it seemed as if the [Scottish] defence would prove more than equal to the attack until a well executed run down by C W Alcock, [[William C. Butler|WC Butler]] and [[Robert Sandilands Frowd Walker|RSF Walker]], acting in concert, enabled the last named of the trio to equalise the score by the accomplishment of a well merited goal<ref>''The Scotsman'' newspaper Monday 27 February 1871 page 7</ref>}}\n\nThese examples of cooperation fit in with the system of backing up, which was prevalent in the London Association game during the 1860s and early 1870s. As systematic forms of passing became more prevalent in association football, Alcock's views on combination would understandably change. Writing in 1883 he gives the following definition of combination:\n{{Quote|Combination is the great object to be studied in the attainment of success in Association football. By combination I mean much more than the mere \"passing on\" which seems to be the one common idea of perfection among a large number of English Associationists... The superiority of the Association elevens of Scotland is not to be attributed to a greater skill of their forwards, or to the advantage of back play. It is to their combination - by which I mean the effective way in which they turn every chance of the game to account, never overlooking any one feature however unimportant it may appear of itself - that they owe their successes over English teams.<ref>Alcock, C.W. (ed), The Football Annual, London, 1883, Pp12-13</ref>}} As the game continued to evolve Alcock would state in 1891: \"An Association eleven of to-day is altogether a different machine to what it was even as recently as ten years ago.<ref name=\"Association Football 1891, page 287\">\"Association Football\", chapter by CW Alcock, ''The English Illustrated Magazine'' 1891, page 287</ref>\n\n==Scientific Football (1839 onwards)==\nThe earliest uses of the term \"scientific\" in the context of sport are in the description of the obligatory team game [[cricket]] (1833)<ref>''The Gentleman's Magazine'', July 1833, page 42</ref> The first use of the term \"scientific\" to describe football comes from [[Dragley Beck]], [[Ulverston]], [[Lancashire]] in 1839.  This states:\n\n{{Quote|FOOT-BALL. Last week a match took place in a field near Dragley Beck between the men of leather and the other trades of Ulverstone. The shoemakers &c challenged the other parties, and it was eventually agreed that each side should have 15 men. The ball was placed about the centre of the ground, and one from each side stood twenty yards from it. At a given signal, two opponents rushed forward, and the representative of leather, Roger Gaskell, took the ball in grand style, thereby winning the glaves. The action then became general, but leather was forced to be content with the laurels already won, as the other party won every bye that was played. Many of the gentle craft were good millers, and carried on the contest toughly, but their opponents played more scientifically, and out manoeuvred them, and carried the day in triumph.\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Sunday, 13 January 1839. New Readerships</ref>}}\n\n\"Scientific\" was first used to describe a modern football code in 1862 with reference to [[Rugby football]]:<ref>''Blackwood's Magazine'', Published by W. Blackwood, 1862, page 563</ref> and in 1868 the \"great science\" of rugby football consisted of \"off your side, drop kicks punts, places and the other intricacies\"<ref>''Tom Brown's school days, by an old boy [T. Hughes]''.  By Tom Brown, Thomas Hughes, Old Boy Edition: 55, 1868</ref> It is uncertain what these other intricacies were exactly, however it is, clear that this playing style was more systematic than in the past. References to scientific football come in accounts in the mid-1860s, particularly Sheffield FC (see later). Later contemporary accounts include internationals, for example the [[England v Scotland (1870)|November 1870 association football match between England and Scotland]] which \"was of unusual excellence for the many scientific points it involved\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 26 November 1870, issue 446</ref>  Alcock advocated scientific football as early as 1870 (see below).\n\n==Sheffield FC: Backing up and the \"passing on\" game (mid-1860s and early 1870s)==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Sheffield FC.svg|thumb|Logo of Sheffield F.C. The World's first non-university football club{{ffdc|1=Sheffield FC.svg|log=2015 December 2}}]] -->\n\nAccording to Alcock,<ref name=\"Football: our winter game\"/> Sheffield FA team provides the first evidence of combination, in particular the \"passing on\" of the Sheffield FA team and their [[Sheffield Rules]].  The offside system of the Sheffield rules allowed poaching or sneaking and the forward pass was permitted:  Players known as \"kick throughs\" were positioned permanently near the opponents goal to receive these balls. For this reason the Sheffield style is known as the \"passing on game\".<ref>Adrian Harvey, ''Football The First Hundred Years'', Routledge, 2005, page 213</ref> As early as January 1865 [[Sheffield F.C.]] was associated with scoring a goal through \"scientific movements\" against Nottingham<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday, 7 January 1865; Issue 2,229: \"The Sheffield party, however, eventually took a lead, and through some scientific movements of Mr J Wild, scored a goal amid great cheering\"</ref> A contemporary match report of November 1865 notes \"We cannot help recording the really scientific play with which the Sheffield men backed each other up\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), 26 November 1865, issue 2275</ref> Combination associated with  Sheffield players is also suggested in 1868: \"a remarkably neat and quick piece of play on the part of K Smith, Denton and J Knowles resulted in a goal for Sheffield, the final kick being given by J. Knowles\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 8 February 1868 issue 2390</ref> \n\nContemporary proof of passing occurs from at least January 1872.  In January 1872 the following account is given against Derby:  \"W. Orton, by a specimen of careful play, running the ball up in close proximity to the goal, from which it was returned to J. Marsh, who by a fine straight shot kicked it through\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Derby Mercury'' (Derby, England), Wednesday, 17 January 1872; Issue 8218.</ref>  This play taking place \"in close proximity to the goal\" suggests a short pass and the \"return\" of the ball to Marsh suggests that this was the second of two passes.  This account also goes onto describe other early tactics:  \"This goal was supplemented by one of T. Butler's most successful expositions of the art of corkscrew play and deceptive tactics which had the effect of exciting the risibility of the spectators\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  A similar account also comes from January 1872:   \"the only goal scored in the match was obtained by Sheffield, owing to a good run up the field by Steel, who passed if judiciously to Matthews, and the latter, by a good straight kick, landed it through the goal out of reach of the custodian\".<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 27 January 1872, Issue 2691</ref>  This match (against Notts) also provided contemporary evidence of \"good dribbling and kicking\" particularly by W.E. Clegg.  The condition of the ground, however, \"militated against a really scientific exhibition\". Their play in March 1872 was described as \"speed, pluck and science of no mean order\"<ref name=\"Bell's Life 2,697\">''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday, 9 March 1872; Issue 2,697.</ref>\n\n==The Royal Engineers A.F.C.: The first combination team (late 1860s to mid-1870s)==\nSir [[Frederick Wall]] (who was the secretary of the Football Association from 1895\u20131934) states in his biography that the combination game was first used by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.]] in the early 1870s, in particular prior to their 1873 tour of Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield .<ref>{{cite book |last= Wall|first= Sir Frederick|authorlink= |title= 50 Years of Football, 1884-1934|year= 2005|publisher= Soccer Books Limited|location= |isbn= 1-86223-116-8}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>Cox, Richard (2002) ''The Encyclopaedia of British Football'', Routledge, United Kingdom</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fhistory.htm |title=History of Football<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418122238/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fhistory.htm |archive-date=18 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>   Wall states that the \"Sappers moved in unison\" and showed the \"advantages of combination over the old style of individualism\".

The Engineers were also capable of dribbling the ball, for example one 1868  match reports states \"[[William George Morris|Lieut. Morris]] got off and dribbling the ball quite round his opponents, brought it in front of the goal and a kick from Lieut Dorward scored the first goal for the Royal Engineers\".<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 12 December 1868, issue 2434</ref>  \n[[File:1stRoyalEngineers.png|thumb|left|300px|The Royal Engineers: the first passing side.

Creswell]], who having brought it up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 5 November 1870, issue 2</ref>\n\n===Royal Engineers in 1871===\nAlthough brief, contemporary match reports confirm that passing was a regular feature of the Engineers' style.  For example, in a match of February 1871 against [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] it is noted that \"[[Hugh Mitchell (Royal Engineers)|Lieut. Mitchell]] made a fine run down the left, passing the ball to [[Henry Rich (footballer)|Lieut. Rich]], who had run up the centre, and who pinced another [goal]\" <ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 25 February 1871, issue 2, 643</ref> The Engineers used their team playing style with effect against the [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]], a side considered as early as 1870 to be  the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] of football.<ref>\"The Sporting Gazette\" of Saturday 12 March 1870, see account of international match of  5 March 1870</ref>   In a match of March 1871 against Wanderers their victory was due to \"irreproachable organisation\" and in particular that both their attacks and their backing up were both \"so well organised\"<ref>''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 18 March 1871, issue 2, 646</ref>  In November 1871 similar passing tactics are described in a contemporary account of a game against the Wanderers in which two goals were scored through tactical passing: \"[[Morton Betts|Betts]], however, soon seized his opportunity, and by a brilliant run down the left wing turned the ball judiciously to Currie, who as judiciously sent it flying through the strangers' goal in first rate style\"<ref name=\"Bell 1871\">''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 18 November 1871, issue 2, 681</ref> Later in the match it is reported that \"Lieut. G Barker, turning the ball to [[Henry Renny-Tailyour|Lieut. Renny-Tailyour]] who planted it between the posts\"<ref name=\"Bell 1871\"/>  \"Turning\" the ball clearly points to the short pass.\n\n===Royal Engineers in 1872===\nThere is evidence that opponents sometimes adjusted their playing style to counteract the organisation and passing of the Engineers. For example, in February 1872 against [[Westminster school]] a brief contemporary match report states that:  \"The school captain took the precaution of strengthening his backs, deputizing [[Henry Dashwood Sealy-Vidal|HDS Vidal]] to cooperate with [[William Rawson|Rawson]] and Jackson and so well did these three play in concert... they succeeded in defying the... RE forwards\" <ref name=\"Bell 1872\">''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday 17 February 1872, issue 2694</ref> What is most notable about this report is that it confirms that the Royal Engineers \"played beautifully together\"<ref name=\"Bell 1872\"/>  That the Engineers were the first side to break the trend of dribbling is shown in a contemporary account of their victory against Crystal Palace in early 1872.  This said that:  \"very little dribbling was displayed\" <ref>\"FOOTBALL.\"  ''Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle'' (London, England), Saturday, 16 March 1872; pg. 8; Issue 2,698. New Readerships.</ref>\n\n===Summary of the Royal Engineers early playing style===\nThe evidence above contains detailed descriptions of passing that are lacking in reports of the [[1872 Scotland v England football match|1872 Glasgow international]].  For example, in a lengthy account ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper makes no mention of passing or combination by the Scottish team and specifically describes the Scottish attacks in terms of dribbling: \"The Scotch now came away with a great rush, [[Robert Leckie (footballer)|Leckie]] and others dribbling the ball so smartly that the English lines were closely besieged and the ball was soon behind\"<ref name=\"Monday 1872, page 6\">''The Scotsman'' - Monday, 2 December 1872, page 6</ref> and \"[[Jerry Weir|Weir]] now had a splendid run for Scotland into the heart of his opponents' territory.<ref name=\"Monday 1872, page 6\"/>\" Although the Scottish team are acknowledged to have worked better together during the first half, this contemporary account acknowledges that in the second half England played similarly: \"During the first half of the game the English team did not work so well together, but in the second half they left nothing to be desired in this respect.<ref name=\"Monday 1872, page 6\"/>\"  The Scotsman concludes that the difference in styles in the first half is the advantage the [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queens' Park]] players had \"through knowing each other's play\" as all came from the same club.  Unlike the 1872 Glasgow international - which was drawn - the contemporary evidence above shows that the Engineers' team playing style benefited their team play by winning games. Similarly, the 5 March 1872 match between Wanderers and Queens park contains no evidence of ball passing.<ref name=\"Bell's Life 2,697\"/>\n\nThe early accounts cited above all confirm that the Engineers were the first club to play a passing game of cooperation and organisation with both their forwards and their defence. Although they could also play rough - as would be expected for an army team - The Engineers are the first side to be considered to play the football \"beautifully\".<ref name=\"Bell 1872\"/>  All of these developments clearly occurred before and independent of the 1872 match between England and Scotland (Queen's Park FC).  It is probable that Queen's Park FC observed the Engineers' passing game during one of their visits to England to participate in the [[1871\u201372 FA Cup]].  Undoubtedly, their representatives in London were well aware of the Sheffield and Engineers' style.\n\n==Queens Park FC, 1867 - 1882: Pioneers of the Modern Passing Game==\nWithin the context of the emerging Association game in Scotland, the late historian and broadcaster [[Bob Crampsey]] compared the role of the Queen's Park club with that of the MCC in Cricket and the [[R&A]] Club in Golf.  The Glasgow club's control of the early playing rules in Scotland, early management of the Scotland national team, and instigation of the [[Scottish Football Association]] and [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] provide evidence of their status as the \u2018Premier\u2019 or \u2018Senior\u2019 club of Scotland.  Within this context, the club's development of a scientific form of combination, which would supersede existing playing styles, should be considered.\n\nThe most obvious outcome from the successful implementation of a football culture is the creation of a \u2018legacy\u2019.  Due to the club's unceasing commitment to promote the game across Scotland, the Queen's Park playing style quickly became a 'Scottish style'.  This playing style was imported into the north and midlands of England during the 1870s and 1880s, by the club itself, by other Scottish clubs, and by an increasing wave of Scottish footballers, who are often referred to by contemporary commentators as '[[Scotch Professors]]', (because of the science of their game). The passing game, as a significant football culture, does not arrive in London until the creation of the London Corinthians in 1882 (in response to Scottish supremacy at international level).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corinthian-casuals.com/clubinfo/history.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831113911/http://www.corinthian-casuals.com/clubinfo/history.php |archivedate=31 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Between 1872 and 1887 Scotland would win 10 times and lose only twice against England in the annual internationals.  The impact of the Scotch Professors in the midlands and north of England would lead to the legalisation of professionalism in 1885 and the development of league football in 1888.\n\n===The Rules of the Field, 1867===\nOn 9 August 1867, one month after the club's formation, the 'Rules of the Field' were discussed and accepted by the Queen's Park committee.  They were based on the Association rules of the period but the club made a number of changes, the most notable being the offside rule.  In 1866 the FA had moved from a rugby style offside rule preventing the ball from being passed forward to a three-man ruling.  Queen's Park would adopt an even more radical approach, which by its design, would open up the game even more to the forward pass. The rule was recorded as follows,\n\n{{Quote|Sixth.\u2014When a player has kicked the ball, any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponents' goal-line is out of play, and may not touch the ball himself, nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so, until the ball has been played, unless there are at least two of his opponents between him and their own goal, who must not be more than fifteen yards from the goal-line; but no player is out of play when the ball is kicked from behind the goal-line.<ref>Robinson, R; ''History of the Queen's Park Football Club'', 1867-1917, Glasgow 1920. P72</ref>}}\n\nOffside only came into being 15 yards from the goal and even then only two defenders were required to be goal side for a player to be onside. The openness of the rule allowed players to be deployed across the field and encouraged the forward pass. In some respects the rule has similarity to the [[Sheffield Rules]] in that it enabled the long forward pass but, unlike the Sheffield code, it also prevented players from poaching or sneaking in front of goal. This carefully considered adaptation of the offside rule demonstrates the meticulous planning and organisation behind the club. It would win the club many admirers including [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], 'Father of the Football League', who pays the following tribute,\n\n{{Quote|Queen\u2019s Park were the first team to develop scientific play. The club must be regarded as a striking example of what good management can accomplish.<ref>Chapter by William McGregor on Queen's Park FC, in Gibson A. and Pickford W. (eds); ''Association Football and the Men Who Made It'', Vol IV, London 1906, P15''</ref>}}\n\nAlthough the game of the late 1860s was rudimentary, the basis for the club's playing style, and the men who would make it happen, all date from this early period.  From this era the passing game of Queen's Park would evolve from simplistic to systematic forms of combination which would be copied throughout Scotland and the UK.\n\n===Regular practice and instruction, 1868 - 1872===\nAt a time when matches against other clubs were difficult to arrange, Queen's Park played internal matches dividing up its membership.  As [[Richard Robinson (writer)|Richard Robinson]] in his early history of the club explains regular practice and instruction, key elements of the combination game, were already being undertaken.\n\n{{Quote|Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays were fixed upon as the nights for play\u2026Whoever selected the teams on practising nights had the power to place their men on the field, or appoint substitutes, and the players shall be bound to adhere to their instructions.<ref>Robinson, R; ''History of the Queen's Park Football Club'', 1867-1917, Glasgow, 1920, P25.</ref>}}\n\n[[Robert Gardner (footballer)|Robert Gardner]] (who captained and picked the Scotland team in the first official international match), as captain of the club, had a profound influence over tactics and team selections. In the match against Hamilton Gymnasium on 29 May 1869 he distributed cards to his team before the match showing each man where he must play.<ref>Quoted in Sanders, R; ''Beastly Fury, The Strange Birth of British Football'', London, 2009, P69.</ref> According to Robinson it was the regular practise games that enabled Queen's Park to develop their brand of combination football.\n\n{{Quote|The club... never neglected practice, and this practice was indulged in systematically. Sides were arranged\u2014 North v. South of Eglinton Toll, Reds v. Blues, Light v. Heavy Weights, President's Team v. J. Smith's Team (a series of six games), and Clerks v. The Field, etc. In these games the dribbling and passing, which raised the Scottish game to the level of a fine art, were developed. Dribbling was a characteristic of English play, and it was not until very much later that the Southerners came to see that the principles laid down in the Queen's Park method of transference of the ball, accompanied by strong backing up, were those which got the most out of a team. Combination was the chief characteristic of the Queen's Park play.<ref>Robinson, R; ''History of the Queen's Park Football Club'', 1867-1917, Glasgow, 1920, P37.</ref>}}\n\n===Queen's Park and 2-2-6 formation, 1872===\nCombination was very much in evidence in both the FA Cup tie against the Wanderers (5 March 1872) and in the international match against England (30 November 1872). In both games the club lined up in a 2-2-6 formation which would be their preferred line up for the remainder of the decade.  In the international match Queen's Park organised the game and provided all of the Scotland players from within its own membership.  The club would form the backbone of the Scotland national team throughout the 1870s and well into the 1880s.  The tactic of combination was certainly successful in combating the superior weight and strength of the opposing players. In the game against Wanderers, the ''Field'' magazine wrote of Queen's Park,\n\n{{Quote|They dribble little and usually convey the ball by a series of long kicks, combined with a judicious plan of passing on.<ref name=\"Sanders, R 2009, P66\">Quoted in Sanders, R; ''Beastly Fury, The Strange Birth of British Football'', London, 2009, P66.</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Herald'', in the same game noted that,\n\n{{Quote|The play of the Glasgow 11 was most creditable, as their forwards worked well together, and their backs kicked with great accuracy. On the other hand, the Wanderers dribbled and played skilfully....but collectively they hardly showed so well as their antagonists.<ref name=\"Sanders, R 2009, P66\"/>}}\n\nIn the first official international match, the first specific reference to a collective passing culture is recorded within the history of Association football. The earliest contemporary reference, dating from 14 December 1872, appears in ''The Graphic'', a weekly illustrated newspaper published in London, and gives clear detail as to the opposing playing styles of the two teams:\n\n{{Quote|Individual skill was generally on England's side, the dribbling of Kirke Smith, Brockbank, and Ottaway being very fine, while Welch, half-back, showed himself a safe and good kick. The Southrons, however, did not play to each other so well as their opponents, who seem to be '''adepts in passing the ball'''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Graphic'' illustrated newspaper, 14 December 1872</ref>}}\n\nTestament to the combination style of football adopted by Queen's Park in the game is given in an eyewitness account by [[Walter Arnott]], who would himself become a leading player for Queen's Park, [[Corinthians]] and Scotland during the 1880s and early 1890s.  Arnott gives a clear description of the historic event at which he was present as a spectator.  Once again the difference in weight is mentioned,\n\n{{Quote|The English team was by far the heavier one. Their forwards played an individual game, and were much faster than those on the Scottish side, whose forward work was done in pairs. What a treat it was to see Clegg or Ottaway getting their ball near their own goal, and making off at a great pace down the field, and only being robbed of it by someone in the last line of the Scottish defence! Then, again, to watch the great [[Jamie Weir]] \u2013 the prince of dribblers \u2013 and his partner, by splendid combined play rushing down the wing and centring the ball with great accuracy right into the goal-mouth.<ref>Chapter by Walter Arnott, in Gibson A. and Pickford W. (eds); ''Association Football and the Men Who Made It'', Vol IV, London, 1906, P22''</ref>}}\n\nIt would appear that the Queen's Park players, unable to match their opponents individually for strength, paired up to stop the dribbling runs of the England players when defending their own goal and played short passes on the run when attacking their opponent's goal.  References alluding to the fact that the Scotland players 'worked from first to last well together, through knowing each other's play' can be found in the Scotsman.<ref>''The Scotsman'' newspaper, 2 December 1872</ref> while the ''Glasgow Herald'' comments that, \"The strong point of the home club was that they played excellently well together.\"<ref>''Glasgow Herald'' newspaper, 2 December 1872</ref>\n\n===Creating a Scottish style===\nQueen's Park took their brand of football to other parts of Scotland, arranging exhibition matches in Dunbartonshire, Edinburgh and Dundee.  The game that they promoted was quite different from the 'backing up' style of the Royal Engineers and the 'passing on' game of Sheffield.  In a match against [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]], played in February 1873, the Glasgow club's systematic form of passing is highlighted in the match report,\n\n{{Quote|Shortly before time was called the Queen's Park came away in fine style, and drove their opponents before them - Messrs Gardner, Leckie, Wotherspoon, Taylor and M'Kinnon working beautifully to each other's feet.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'' newspaper, 17 February 1873</ref>}}\n\nTheir passing game became a Scottish style which was distinctive from other parts of the UK.  An early example of other Scottish clubs emulating the passing style and 2-2-6 formation of Queen's Park can be found in January 1874.  The ''Glasgow Herald'''s report on the match between the [[Third Lanark A.C.|3rd Lanark]] and [[Western F.C.|Western]] clubs states,\n\n{{Quote|On ends being changed, the 3rd men, who were smarting from the unexpected turn of luck, very soon got to work in earnest, and M'Neil, taking the ball in tow up his side of the ground, passed it beautifully to Dick, who was in waiting and who in turn passed it very judiciously to Miller, who kicked a very pretty goal.  No better sample of the passing game could be desired than that shown in the taking of this goal; and as in this case, when combined with good dribbling, it has a telling effect and ought to be the principle study of all Association players.<ref>''Glasgow Herald'' newspaper, 20 January 1874</ref>}}\n\n===Dribbling and Passing===\nThe argument contained within the [[Royal Engineers]] section which opposes the Scottish view of the first international match focuses on the contemporary ''Scotsman'' newspaper article which gives reference to Scottish players dribbling the ball. The Scottish argument, however, contends that the playing style of the Queen's Park players, throughout the 1870s, accommodated both [[dribbling]] and passing.  The evidence is certainly plentiful. This can be seen in [[The Graphic]] newspaper article which on the one hand refers to the Scottish team as being adept at passing the ball but on the other also presents evidence of Scottish players dribbling the ball,\n\n{{Quote|Let it suffice to say that Ker (Scotland) closed the match by the most brilliant run of the day, dribbling the ball past the whole field close on the English lines before he was stopped...<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nIn short, the playing tactics of Queen's Park FC allowed for the ball to be passed when possession was about to be lost or when a greater advantage could be attained; the dribble forward was augmented with a short pass to a teammate.\n\nWriting in the ''[[Football Annual]]'' in 1883, [[Charles W. Alcock]] observed that,\n\n{{Quote|It has been the combination of '''dribbling and passing''' that has made the Queen's Park and other Scotch elevens such splendid teams.<ref>Alcock, C.W. (ed), The Football Annual, London, 1883, P12</ref>}}\n\nTellingly C.W. Alcock, the FA's most influential administrator during the 1860s and 1870s, makes no reference in any of his numerous articles to the role of the Royal Engineers in developing a passing game. This confirms that the backing up system of the Engineers did not involve systematic passing.\n\nIn contrast to this, the newspaper article which features Queen's Park's victory over Wanderers in October 1875 (a match in which C.W. Alcock and the Anglo Scot A.F. Kinnaird played in for Wanderers) gives a concise description of the style of combination adopted by the club, particularly in the section which describes the second and third goals,\n\n{{Quote|After a \u201chand\u201d within thirty yards of the Wanderers\u2019 lines, Weir got possession, and, successfully charging the English forwards, passed it on to Herriot, who in turn placed it to Campbell, who by a well judged kick dropped the ball just below the bar, thus securing another goal for the Scotsmen in sixteen minutes. No sooner had the English captain started the ball than Herriot, Weir and Lawrie, by neat passing sent it back, and after the backs and half backs had shown good play, the two M'Neills brought it along the left side, and passing it to Lawrie, the latter made a shot for goal, but the ball passed just outside the goal post. The play was now in the centre, the Queen\u2019s Park men '''dribbling and passing''', while their opponents indulged chiefly in heavy kicking. In 33 minutes from the commencement of operations H. M'Neill, obtaining possession, kicked the ball to Herriot, who unselfishly serving it to Lawrie, the latter again made a shot for goal, this time with more success, as the ball, passing above the goalkeeper\u2019s head, went clean through thus obtaining the third goal.}}\n\n===The passing game and Scottish supremacy===\nIn the south east of England as the coordinated system of 'backing up' began to decline, the systematic passing game of Queen's Park would eventually win through. It was England's 5-1 defeat in 1882 to a Scotland team featuring seven Queen's Park players which led to Nicholas Lane Jackson, a prominent member of the FA, creating the famous [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]] team. This direct reaction to the success of Queen's Park and the Scotland national team is quoted in the book ''Corinthians and Cricketers'',\n\n{{Quote|It would not be wrong to claim for Queen's Park the building of Scottish football almost single-handed.... It has wielded a profound influence in fashioning the technique of the game, and its development of scientific passing and cohesion between the half-backs and the forwards as a counter to the traditional dribbling and individuality...During those barren years England's teams consisted of amateur players from many different clubs...who had to combine their individuality without any pre-match knowledge of each other's play...Not surprisingly, England failed to beat an enemy nurtured on scientific combination. This position might have continued much longer until the flood tide of professionalism had its inevitable effect; but one of the most industrious and enthusiastic of the game's earliest legislators, N. Lane ('Pa') Jackson, who was then honorary assistant secretary of The Football Association, sought a more immediate solution. 'At that period', he has recorded for us in his autobiography, Sporting Days and Sporting Ways, 'public school and university men provided most of the players for the English side, so I thought that by giving them plenty of practice together they would acquire a certain measure of combination.<ref>Grayson. E.; ''Corinthians and Cricketers, and towards a new sporting era'', London, 1957</ref>}}\n\nThe rudimentary 'passing on' game of Sheffield could not compete with the scientific short passing style championed by Queen's Park and at representative level the [[Glasgow Football Association|Glasgow FA]] would experience 14 wins and only one defeat against the [[Sheffield Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in the 17 fixtures played between 1874 and 1890. A good example of the difference in playing styles is cited in the Scottish Football Annual of 1877/78 which gives the following comments on the Glasgow v Sheffield match of 1877,\n\n{{Quote|That the game was a very well contested one, and victory has rested with the best side, no one will deny; but that it was a pretty game, abounding in fine displays of combined dribbling, which has frequently distinguished a Scottish team above all others, few will admit\u2026The fact cannot be hidden\u2026that the tactics pursued by the Sheffield team on Saturday were partially responsible for this inasmuch as they play a different set of rules from those of the English and Scottish Associations, and to them our \u201coff-side\u201d rule is next to a dead letter. In this manner, long kicking was largely indulged in on Saturday on their side; and in order to meet the same style of play, the Glasgow men actually lost that united action which had led them on to victory in many a harder fought field.<ref>Scottish Football Annual, 1877/78, Glasgow, 1877</ref>}}\n\n===Legacy of the Scottish combination game===\nQueen's Park's combination game, which had emerged as a general \u2018Scottish style\u2019 due to the club's high standing and her energetic promotion of the game, would spread south of the border, to the north and midlands of England, through the efforts of the club and with the arrival of the [[Scotch Professors]]. [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], the Father of the Football League and president of [[Aston Villa FC]], pays the following tribute,\n\n{{Quote|...their missionary visits to the Midlands and Lancashire did much to create a true love for Association football in those districts and also to give a tone and polish to local football effort.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime.

(2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his [Felix's] unbounded confidence.

Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many mmetings with [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\n===Death===\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 ''Lieder'' (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op. 30) appearing in 1833\u201334.

She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with others suggesting they represent her own life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them.

Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research.

She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models represented by her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819.

(2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his [Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\n[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\nIn 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nWilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 ''Lieder'' (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op. 30) appearing in 1833\u201334.

She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with others suggesting they represent her own life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary.

Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

He instead encouraged her to practice anesthesiology because he felt that advancements in anesthesia were needed to further advance surgery and felt that she had the \"energy and ability\" to make a significant contribution.<ref name=\":2\" /> Deciding to continue her career in anesthesiology, she trained for six months under [[Ralph M.

In conjunction with [[Allen Whipple]], she started P&S's anesthesia division. She was placed in charge of the division's administrative duties and was also tasked with co-ordinating the staffing of the division and its work throughout the hospital. Throughout much of the 1940s, she was an administrator, teacher, recruiter, coordinator and practicing physician.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Virginia Apgar.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Virginia Apgar examining a [[Infant|newborn baby]] in 1966]]\nIt was often difficult to find residents for the program, as anesthesiology had only recently been converted from a nursing specialty to a physician specialty. New anesthesiologists also faced scrutiny from other physicians, specifically surgeons, who were not used to having an anesthesia-specialized MD in the operating room. These difficulties led to issues in gaining funding and support for the division. With America's entrance into [[World War II]] in 1941, many medical professionals enlisted in the military to help the war effort, which created a serious staffing problem for domestic hospitals, Apgar's division included.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen the war ended in 1945, interest in anesthesiology was renewed in returning physicians, and the staffing problem for Apgar's division was quickly resolved. The specialty's growing popularity and Apgar's development of its residency program prompted P&S to establish it as an official department in 1949. Due to her lack of research, Apgar was not made the head of the department as was expected and the job was given to her colleague, [[Emanuel Papper|Emmanuel Papper]]. Apgar was given a faculty position at P&S.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Obstetrics===\nIn 1949, Apgar became the first woman to become a [[full professor]] at P&S,<ref>[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/lits/library/changingthefaceofmedicine/connection.shtml Women in Medicine Exhibit Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901204109/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/lits/library/changingthefaceofmedicine/connection.shtml |date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref> where she remained until 1959.<ref name=\"amschler\" /> During this time, she also did clinical and research work at the affiliated [[Sloane Hospital for Women]], still a division of [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]].<ref>[http://cumc.columbia.edu/dept/obgyn/about/history.html Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071324/http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/obgyn/about/history.html |date=May 17, 2008 }}</ref> In 1953, she introduced the first test, called the [[Apgar score]], to assess the health of newborn babies.\n\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, the United States [[infant mortality rate]] decreased, but the number of infant deaths within the first 24 hours after birth remained constant. Apgar noticed this trend and began to investigate methods for decreasing the infant mortality rate specifically within the first 24 hours of the infant's life. As an obstetric anesthesiologist, Apgar was able to document trends that could distinguish healthy infants from infants in trouble.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis investigation led to a standardized scoring system used to assess a newborn's health after birth, with the result referred to as the newborn's \"[[Apgar score]]\". Each newborn is given a score of 0, 1 or 2 (a score of 2 meaning the newborn is in optimal condition, 0 being in distress) in each of the following categories: heart rate, respiration, color, muscle tone and reflex irritability. Compiled scores for each newborn can range between 0 and 10, with 10 being the best possible condition for a newborn. The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn's condition did not sufficiently improve. By the 1960s, many hospitals in the United States were using the Apgar score consistently.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 21st century, the score continues to be used to provide an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth .<ref name=\":16\">{{cite journal|pmc=2943160|title=Association of Apgar scores with death and neurologic disability|journal=Clinical Epidemiology|volume=1|pages=45\u201353|year=2009|last1=Ehrenstein|first1=V.|pmid=20865086|doi=10.2147/CLEP.S4782}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Apgar left Columbia and earned a [[Professional degrees of public health|Master of Public Health]] degree from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]].<ref name=\"amschler\"/> From 1959 until her death in 1974, Apgar worked for the [[March of Dimes]] Foundation, serving as vice president for medical affairs and directing its research program to prevent and treat [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]].<ref name=Dezen2011/>\n\nAs [[gestational age]] is directly related to an infant's Apgar Score, Apgar was one of the first at the March of Dimes to bring attention to the problem of [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], now one of the March of Dimes' top priorities.<ref name=Dezen2011/> During this time, she wrote and lectured extensively, writing articles in popular magazines as well as research work.<ref name=\"amschler\"/> In 1967, Apgar became vice president and director of basic research at The National Foundation-March of Dimes.<ref name=\"amschler\"/>\n\nDuring the [[rubella]] [[pandemic]] of 1964\u201365, Apgar became an advocate for universal [[vaccination]] to prevent [[vertical transmission|mother-to-child transmission]] of rubella.<ref name=\"Dezen2011\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/news/march-of-dimes-honors-100th-anniversary-of-virginia-apgar.aspx|title=March of Dimes Honors 100th Anniversary Of Virginia Apgar|date=June 24, 2009 |publisher=March of Dimes Foundation|location=White Plains, New York|accessdate=}}</ref> Rubella can cause serious congenital disorders if a woman becomes infected while pregnant.

These led to 2,100 deaths in infancy, 12,000 cases of [[Sensorineural hearing loss|deafness]], 3,580 cases of blindness due to [[cataract]]s and/or [[microphthalmia]] and 1,800 cases of [[Mental retardation|intellectual disability]].

She proved an excellent ambassador for the National Foundation, and the annual income of that organization more than doubled during her tenure there. She also served the National Foundation as Director of Basic Medical Research (1967\u20131968) and Vice-President for Medical Affairs (1971\u20131974). Her concerns for the welfare of children and families were combined with her talent for teaching in the 1972 book ''Is My Baby All Right?'', written with Joan Beck.\n\nApgar was also a lecturer (1965\u20131971) and then clinical professor (1971\u20131974) of pediatrics at Cornell University School of Medicine, where she taught teratology (the study of birth defects). She was the first to hold a faculty position in this new area of pediatrics. In 1973, she was appointed a lecturer in medical genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.<ref name=\"profiles.nlm.nih.gov\" />\n\nApgar published over sixty scientific articles and numerous shorter essays for newspapers and magazines during her career, along with her book, ''Is My Baby All Right?''. She received many awards, including honorary doctorates from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964) and Mount Holyoke College (1965), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from the American Medical Women's Association (1966), the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966), the Alumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973) and the Ralph M. Waters Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1973). In 1973 she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''.\n\nApgar was equally at home speaking to teens as she was to the movers and shakers of society. She spoke at March of Dimes Youth Conferences about teen pregnancy and congenital disorders at a time when these topics were considered taboo.<ref name=\"Dezen2011\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nThroughout her career, Apgar maintained that \"women are liberated from the time they leave the womb\" and that being female had not imposed significant limitations on her medical career. She avoided women's organizations and causes, for the most part. Though she sometimes privately expressed her frustration with sex inequalities (especially in the matter of salaries), she worked around these by consistently pushing into new fields where there was room to exercise her considerable energy and abilities.<ref name=\"profiles.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\nMusic was an integral part of family life, with frequent family music sessions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Apgar played the violin and her brother played piano and organ.<ref name=\":0\" /> She traveled with her violin, often playing in amateur chamber [[quartets]] wherever she happened to be. During the 1950s, a friend introduced her to instrument-making, and together they made two violins, a viola and a cello.

In conjunction with Dr. [[Allen Whipple]], she started P&S's anesthesia division. She was placed in charge of the division's administrative duties and was also tasked with co-ordinating the staffing of the division and its work throughout the hospital. Throughout much of the 1940s, she was an administrator, teacher, recruiter, coordinator and practicing physician.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Virginia Apgar.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Virginia Apgar examining a [[Infant|newborn baby]] in 1966]]\nIt was often difficult to find residents for the program, as anesthesiology had only recently been converted from a nursing specialty to a physician specialty. New anesthesiologists also faced scrutiny from other physicians, specifically surgeons, who were not used to having an anesthesia-specialized MD in the operating room. These difficulties led to issues in gaining funding and support for the division. With America's entrance into [[World War II]] in 1941, many medical professionals enlisted in the military to help the war effort, which created a serious staffing problem for domestic hospitals, Apgar's division included.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhen the war ended in 1945, interest in anesthesiology was renewed in returning physicians, and the staffing problem for Apgar's division was quickly resolved. The specialty's growing popularity and Apgar's development of its residency program prompted P&S to establish it as an official department in 1949. Due to her lack of research, Apgar was not made the head of the department as was expected and the job was given to her colleague, Dr. [[Emanuel Papper|Emmanuel Papper]].

Apgar noticed this trend and began to investigate methods for decreasing the infant mortality rate specifically within the first 24 hours of the infant's life. As an obstetric anesthesiologist, Apgar was able to document trends that could distinguish healthy infants from infants in trouble.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis investigation led to a standardized scoring system used to assess a newborn's health after birth, with the result referred to as the newborn's \"[[Apgar score]]\". Each newborn is given a score of 0, 1 or 2 (a score of 2 meaning the newborn is in optimal condition, 0 being in distress) in each of the following categories: heart rate, respiration, color, muscle tone and reflex irritability. Compiled scores for each newborn can range between 0 and 10, with 10 being the best possible condition for a newborn. The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn's condition did not sufficiently improve. By the 1960s, many hospitals in the United States were using the Apgar score consistently.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 21st century, the score continues to be used to provide an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth .<ref name=\":16\">{{cite journal|pmc=2943160|title=Association of Apgar scores with death and neurologic disability|journal=Clinical Epidemiology|volume=1|pages=45\u201353|year=2009|last1=Ehrenstein|first1=V.|pmid=20865086|doi=10.2147/CLEP.S4782}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, Apgar left Columbia and earned a [[Professional degrees of public health|Master of Public Health]] degree from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]].<ref name=\"amschler\"/> From 1959 until her death in 1974, Apgar worked for the [[March of Dimes]] Foundation, serving as vice president for medical affairs and directing its research program to prevent and treat [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]].<ref name=Dezen2011/>\n\nAs [[gestational age]] is directly related to an infant's Apgar Score, Apgar was one of the first at the March of Dimes to bring attention to the problem of [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], now one of the March of Dimes' top priorities.<ref name=Dezen2011/> During this time, she wrote and lectured extensively, writing articles in popular magazines as well as research work.<ref name=\"amschler\"/> In 1967, Apgar became vice president and director of basic research at The National Foundation-March of Dimes.<ref name=\"amschler\"/>\n\nDuring the [[rubella]] [[pandemic]] of 1964\u201365, Apgar became an advocate for universal [[vaccination]] to prevent [[vertical transmission|mother-to-child transmission]] of rubella.<ref name=\"Dezen2011\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/news/march-of-dimes-honors-100th-anniversary-of-virginia-apgar.aspx|title=March of Dimes Honors 100th Anniversary Of Virginia Apgar|date=June 24, 2009 |publisher=March of Dimes Foundation|location=White Plains, New York|accessdate=}}</ref> Rubella can cause serious congenital disorders if a woman becomes infected while pregnant.

Her concerns for the welfare of children and families were combined with her talent for teaching in the 1972 book ''Is My Baby All Right?'', written with Joan Beck.\n\nApgar was also a lecturer (1965\u20131971) and then clinical professor (1971\u20131974) of pediatrics at Cornell University School of Medicine, where she taught teratology (the study of birth defects). She was the first to hold a faculty position in this new area of pediatrics. In 1973, she was appointed a lecturer in medical genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.<ref name=\"profiles.nlm.nih.gov\" />\n\nApgar published over sixty scientific articles and numerous shorter essays for newspapers and magazines during her career, along with her book, ''Is My Baby All Right?''. She received many awards, including honorary doctorates from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964) and Mount Holyoke College (1965), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from the American Medical Women's Association (1966), the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966), the Alumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973) and the Ralph M. Waters Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1973). In 1973 she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''.\n\nApgar was equally at home speaking to teens as she was to the movers and shakers of society. She spoke at March of Dimes Youth Conferences about teen pregnancy and congenital disorders at a time when these topics were considered taboo.<ref name=\"Dezen2011\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nThroughout her career, Apgar maintained that \"women are liberated from the time they leave the womb\" and that being female had not imposed significant limitations on her medical career. She avoided women's organizations and causes, for the most part. Though she sometimes privately expressed her frustration with sex inequalities (especially in the matter of salaries), she worked around these by consistently pushing into new fields where there was room to exercise her considerable energy and abilities.<ref name=\"profiles.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\nMusic was an integral part of family life, with frequent family music sessions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Apgar played the violin and her brother played piano and organ.<ref name=\":0\" /> She traveled with her violin, often playing in amateur chamber [[quartets]] wherever she happened to be. During the 1950s, a friend introduced her to instrument-making, and together they made two violins, a viola and a cello. She was an enthusiastic gardener and enjoyed fly-fishing, golfing and stamp collecting. In her fifties, Apgar started taking flying lessons, stating that her goal was to someday fly under New York's [[George Washington Bridge]].<ref name=\"profiles.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/CP/p-nid/178|title=The Virginia Apgar Papers: Biographical Information|website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nApgar never married or had children, and died of [[cirrhosis]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Women Healers |last=Scrivener |first=Laurie |last2=Barnes|first2=J.

In 1994, she was honored by the [[United States Postal Service]] with a 20\u00a2 [[Great Americans series]] [[postage stamp]].
