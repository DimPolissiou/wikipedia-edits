Among the many captives was Juwayriya, whose husband, Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among Muhammad's companion Thabit b. Qays b. Al-Shammas. Troubled by this, Juwayriya sought a deed of redemption from Muhammad. Muhammad proposed to marry her and, as a result, freed her from the bondage of Thabit b. Qais and consequently ameliorated the condition of her captured tribe.<ref>Alfred Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, p. 490-493.</ref>\n\nThis incident was described in more detail:\n\n\"At the first opportunity [after her capture] she went to the Prophet, and pleaded her case with him. She told him that she was the daughter of a chieftain and used to command and because of her unfortunate circumstance she found herself in this helpless position. From a throne made of gold she had fallen into dust. ...How could she possibly live the life as a slave? She pleaded with the Prophet, to take notice of the pitiful and desperate condition in which she found herself.\n\nThe Prophet, was moved by her sorrowful plea and asked her if she would like to live as a free woman and be part of his household if he paid her ransom. She had never in her dreams expected this offer.

Lowry rejected five [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] during his life, including a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] (1968). He holds the record for the most rejected British honours. On 26 June 2013, a major retrospective opened at the [[Tate Britain]] in [[London]], his first at the Tate, and, in 2014, his first solo exhibition outside the UK was held in [[Nanjing]], China.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:117 Station Road, Pendlebury.jpg|thumb|Lowry's former home, 117 Station Road, [[Pendlebury]]]]\n\nLowry was born on 1 November 1887 at 8 Barrett Street [[Stretford]], which was then in [[Lancashire]].<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Stretford Area\n | last = Anon\n | work = Blue Plaques In Trafford\n | publisher = Trafford Council\n | url = http://www.trafford.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-lifestyle/libraries/blue-plaques-in-stretford.aspx\n | access-date = 24 February 2015\n}}</ref> It was a difficult birth, and his mother Elizabeth, who hoped for a girl, was uncomfortable even looking at him at first.

She is reported to have been talented and respected, with aspirations of becoming a [[concert pianist]]. She was an irritable, nervous woman brought up to expect high standards by her stern father. Like him, she was controlling and intolerant of failure. She used illness as a means of securing the attention and obedience of her mild and affectionate husband and she dominated her son in the same way. Lowry maintained that he had an unhappy childhood, growing up in a repressive family atmosphere. Although his mother demonstrated no appreciation of her son's gifts as an artist, a number of books Lowry received as Christmas presents from his parents are inscribed to ''\"Our dearest Laurie\"''. At school he made few friends and showed no academic aptitude. His father was affectionate towards him but was, by all accounts, a quiet man who was at his most comfortable fading into the background as an unobtrusive presence.<ref>Julian Spalding, ''Lowry'', (Oxford: Phaidon, New York: Dutton, 1979)</ref><ref>Paul Vallely, 'Will I be a great artist?', ''The Independent'', 23 February 2006</ref>\n\nMuch of Lowry's early years were spent in the leafy Manchester suburb of [[Victoria Park, Manchester|Victoria Park]], [[Rusholme]], but in 1909, when he was 22, due to financial pressures, the family moved to 117 Station Road in the industrial town of [[Pendlebury]].<ref>{{Cite news\n |title='Golden opportunity' to save important piece of city's heritage is missed as Lowry's former house is sold off\n |author=Neal Keeling\n |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]\n |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/golden-opportunity-save-important-piece-7989264\n |date=24 October 2014\n |access-date=14 November 2015\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022533/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/golden-opportunity-save-important-piece-7989264\n |archivedate=17 November 2015\n}}</ref> Here the landscape comprised textile mills and factory chimneys rather than trees.

His mother, subject to neurosis and depression, became bedridden and dependent on her son for care. Lowry painted after his mother had fallen asleep, between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. Many paintings produced during this period were damning self-portraits (often referred to as the ''\"Horrible Heads\"'' series), which demonstrate the influence of [[expressionism]] and may have been inspired by an exhibition of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s work at [[Manchester Art Gallery]] in 1931. He expressed regret that he received little recognition as an artist until his mother died (1939) and that she was not able to enjoy his success. From the mid-1930s until at least 1939, Lowry took annual holidays at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]. After the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Lowry served as a volunteer fire watcher and became an official [[war artist]] in 1943.

Instead, he began to focus on groups of figures and odd imaginary characters. Unknown to his friends and the public, Lowry produced a series of erotic works that were not seen until after his death. The paintings depict the mysterious ''\"[[Portrait of Ann|Ann]]\"'' figure, who appears in portraits and sketches produced throughout his lifetime, enduring sexually charged and humiliating tortures. When these works were exhibited at the Art Council's Centenary exhibition at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] in 1988, art critic Richard Dorment wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that these works \"reveal a sexual anxiety which is never so much as hinted at in the work of the previous 60 years.\" The group of erotic works, which are sometimes referred to as \"the mannequin sketches\" or \"marionette works\", are kept at the Lowry Centre and are available for visitors to see on request. Some are also brought up into the public display area on a rotation system. Manchester author [[Howard Jacobson]] has argued that the images are just part of Lowry's melancholy and tortured view of the world and that they would change the public perception of the complexity of his work if they were more widely seen.<ref>{{Cite news\n | title = Lowry's dark imagination comes to light\n | last = Thorpe | first = Vanessa\n | newspaper = The Observer\n | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/25/artnews.art\n | date = 25 March 2007 | access-date = 28 April 2012\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Let Lowrys see the light\n |last=Osuh\n |first=Chris\n |newspaper=Manchester Evening News\n |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1002835_let_lowrys_see_the_light\n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130422035748/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1002835_let_lowrys_see_the_light\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=22 April 2013\n |date=26 March 2007\n |access-date=28 April 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:LowryCentre.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Lowry Centre on Salford Quays]]\nLowry died of [[pneumonia]] at the Woods Hospital in [[Glossop]], [[Derbyshire]], on 23 February 1976, aged 88.

The programme enlisted the help of various experts to determine whether the paintings were genuine or forgeries. The works in question had been bought in the 1960s by a [[Cheshire]] businessman, Gerald Ames, but their [[provenance]] was poor, and it was noted that Lowry was \"probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers\". All three works were judged to be genuine by a panel of experts, and the total value of the paintings was estimated to be in excess of \u00a3200,000.\nThe programme also revealed that while Lowry often claimed to use only five colours (lead white, ivory black, vermillion, Prussian blue and yellow ochre), he also used titanium white and zinc white. This use of other paints became helpful when determining that the above works were genuine.<ref name=\"Fake or Fortune\">{{Cite web\n | title = BBC iPlayer - Fake or Fortune? - Series 4: 1.

Many of his drawings and paintings depict [[Pendlebury]], [[Lancashire]], where he lived and worked for more than 40 years, [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]] and its vicinity.\n\nLowry is famous for painting scenes of life in the [[industrial district]]s of [[North West England]] in the mid-20th century. He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures, often referred to as \"matchstick men\". He painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding portraits and the unpublished \"marionette\" works, which were only found after his death.\n\nUse of stylised figures and lack of weather effects in many of his landscapes have led to a label of [[Na\u00efve art|na\u00efve]]<ref>{{Cite news\n | title = L.

Lowry rejected five [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]] during his life, including a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] (1968). He holds the record for the most rejected British honours. On 26 June 2013, a major retrospective opened at the [[Tate Britain]] in [[London]], his first at the Tate, and, in 2014, his first solo exhibition outside the UK was held in [[Nanjing]], China.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:117 Station Road, Pendlebury.jpg|thumb|Lowry's former home, 117 Station Road, [[Pendlebury]]]]\n\nLowry was born on 1 November 1887 at 8 Barrett Street [[Stretford]], which was then in [[Lancashire]].<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Stretford Area\n | last = Anon\n | work = Blue Plaques In Trafford\n | publisher = Trafford Council\n | url = http://www.trafford.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-lifestyle/libraries/blue-plaques-in-stretford.aspx\n | access-date = 24 February 2015\n}}</ref> It was a difficult birth, and his mother Elizabeth, who hoped for a girl, was uncomfortable even looking at him at first.

She is reported to have been talented and respected, with aspirations of becoming a [[concert pianist]]. She was an irritable, nervous woman brought up to expect high standards by her stern father. Like him, she was controlling and intolerant of failure. She used illness as a means of securing the attention and obedience of her mild and affectionate husband and she dominated her son in the same way. Lowry maintained that he had an unhappy childhood, growing up in a repressive family atmosphere. Although his mother demonstrated no appreciation of her son's gifts as an artist, a number of books Lowry received as Christmas presents from his parents are inscribed to ''\"Our dearest Laurie\"''. At school he made few friends and showed no academic aptitude.

Taylor of the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' took an interest in his work and encouraged him to move away from the sombre palette he was using. Taking this advice on board, Lowry began to use a white background to lighten the pictures.<ref name=\"Guardian 1976\" /> He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures, often referred to as \"matchstick men\".

His mother, subject to neurosis and depression, became bedridden and dependent on her son for care. Lowry painted after his mother had fallen asleep, between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. Many paintings produced during this period were damning self-portraits (often referred to as the ''\"Horrible Heads\"'' series), which demonstrate the influence of [[expressionism]] and may have been inspired by an exhibition of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s work at [[Manchester Art Gallery]] in 1931. He expressed regret that he received little recognition as an artist until his mother died (1939) and that she was not able to enjoy his success. From the mid-1930s until at least 1939, Lowry took annual holidays at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]. After the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Lowry served as a volunteer fire watcher and became an official [[war artist]] in 1943.

Instead, he began to focus on groups of figures and odd imaginary characters. Unknown to his friends and the public, Lowry produced a series of erotic works that were not seen until after his death. The paintings depict the mysterious ''\"[[Portrait of Ann|Ann]]\"'' figure, who appears in portraits and sketches produced throughout his lifetime, enduring sexually charged and humiliating tortures. When these works were exhibited at the Art Council's Centenary exhibition at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] in 1988, art critic Richard Dorment wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that these works \"reveal a sexual anxiety which is never so much as hinted at in the work of the previous 60 years.\" The group of erotic works, which are sometimes referred to as \"the mannequin sketches\" or \"marionette works\", are kept at the Lowry Centre and are available for visitors to see on request. Some are also brought up into the public display area on a rotation system. Manchester author [[Howard Jacobson]] has argued that the images are just part of Lowry's melancholy and tortured view of the world and that they would change the public perception of the complexity of his work if they were more widely seen.<ref>{{Cite news\n | title = Lowry's dark imagination comes to light\n | last = Thorpe | first = Vanessa\n | newspaper = The Observer\n | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/25/artnews.art\n | date = 25 March 2007 | access-date = 28 April 2012\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Let Lowrys see the light\n |last=Osuh\n |first=Chris\n |newspaper=Manchester Evening News\n |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1002835_let_lowrys_see_the_light\n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130422035748/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1002835_let_lowrys_see_the_light\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=22 April 2013\n |date=26 March 2007\n |access-date=28 April 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:LowryCentre.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Lowry Centre on Salford Quays]]\nLowry died of [[pneumonia]] at the Woods Hospital in [[Glossop]], [[Derbyshire]], on 23 February 1976, aged 88.

The works in question had been bought in the 1960s by a [[Cheshire]] businessman, Gerald Ames, but their [[provenance]] was poor, and it was noted that Lowry was \"probably the most faked British artist, his deceptively simple style of painting making him a soft target for forgers\". All three works were judged to be genuine by a panel of experts, and the total value of the paintings was estimated to be in excess of \u00a3200,000.\nThe programme also revealed that while Lowry often claimed to use only five colours (lead white, ivory black, vermillion, Prussian blue and yellow ochre), he also used titanium white and zinc white.

Lowry claimed to have only used five colours, [[White lead|flake white (lead white)]], [[ivory black]], [[Vermilion|vermillion red]], [[Prussian blue]] and [[yellow ochre]], produced by [[Winsor & Newton]]. Photographic evidence from the 1950s, however, showed that he had experimented with both [[titanium white]] and [[zinc white]]: ''Darby and Joan'' contained traces of zinc white. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film.<ref name=\"Fake or Fortune\"/>\n* The 2019 film ''[[Mrs Lowry & Son]]'', directed by [[Adrian Noble]] and starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Timothy Spall]], depicts the fraught relationship between Lowry and his elderly bed-ridden mother between 1934 and 1939.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barraclough |first1=Leo |title=Timothy Spall, Vanessa Redgrave's 'Mrs Lowry & Son' Wraps Filming, New Image Released (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/global/timothy-spall-vanessa-redgrave-mrs-lowry-son-2-1202704761/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |accessdate=27 August 2019 |date=20 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist| refs = <!-- Please keep the following list-defined references in alphabetical order by refname -->\n\n<ref name=\"cripples\">{{Cite web| title = The Cripples (1949)\n | publisher = leninimports.com\n | url = http://www.leninimports.com/ls_lowry_the_cripples_oil.html\n | access-date = 26 May 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"perceptions\">{{Cite web\n |title=Policy implications of the social perceptions of disabled people\n |last1=Massie\n |first1=Bert\n |publisher=King's College\n |location=London\n |url=http://www.jcmd.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Perceptions-of-Disabled.pdf\n |access-date=26 May 2015\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526195227/http://www.jcmd.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Perceptions-of-Disabled.pdf\n |archivedate=26 May 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n}}<!-- Please keep the above list-defined references in alphabetical order by refname -->\n\n===Sources===\n* Andrews, Allen.

Between 1969 and 1974, Vustin worked as a music editor at USSR Radio. From 1974 he worked as an editor at the [[Kompozitor]] publishing house.\n\n==Music==\nVustin has composed since 1963: however, he regards only those works written since 1972 as valid. His musical language is distinctive by the remarkable organization of its musical texture. Vustin uses the [[twelve-tone technique]], but in his own original way.\n\nHis first notable compositions were written in the midst of the 70s: the eight-minute-long ''The Word'' (scored for ensemble of woodwinds, brass and percussion (1975)) was dedicated to Grigori Frid; and the three-minute long ''In Memory of [[Boris Klyuzner]]'', for baritone and string quartet (1977) was set to the autobiographical text by [[Yuri Olesha]].  Another striking piece, ''Blessed are the Poor in Spirit'' for boy-soprano (or counter-tenor) accompanied by a chamber ensemble was composed in 1988 to the text from Matthew 5:3\u20138.\n\nHis opera ''[[The Devil in Love (opera)|The Devil in Love]]'', to the Russian libretto by [[Vladimir Khachaturov]] after the novel ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|The Devil in Love]]'' by [[Jacques Cazotte]], the result of 15 years of labour, (1975\u20131989) is probably one of the most important of his works. Its musical material nourished the dozens of compositions written in around the same period. The world premiere of the opera took place on 15 February 2019 at the [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre]] under [[Vladimir Jurowski]], conductor.\n\nThe works of Alexander Vustin are often included in the programmes of major festivals, such as the \"Kremerata Musica\", Tage f\u00fcr Neue Musik (Z\u00fcrich), Holland Festival, the 14th Musik Biennale Berlin, Pres\u00e8nce 93 (Paris), Melos-Ethos (Bratislava), Maraton Soudobe Hudby (Prague), Donaueschinger Musiktage and Deutsche Kammerphilarmonie (Germany), Kammermusikfest Lockenhaus (Austria), Moscow Forum, and Moscow Autumn (Russia). Among performers of his music are the conductors [[Vladimir Jurowski]], [[Reinbert de Leeuw]], [[Lev Markiz]], [[Eri Klas]], [[Igor Dronov]], [[Alexander Lazarev]], [[Vitaly Kataev]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Martyn Brabbins]], and [[Cristoph Hagel]]. Ensembles include [[Kremerata Baltica]], Amsterdam Wind Orchestra, Sch\u00f6nberg Ensemble, Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam (Netherlands), the Mark Pekasky Percussion Ensemble, Studio New Music, Ensemble of Soloists of the Bolshoi Theatre, the Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nHe died on 19 April 2020 from pneumonia.<ref>[https://rg.ru/2020/04/19/ot-pnevmonii-umer-kompozitor-aleksandr-vustin.html \u041e\u0442 \u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d], rg.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Wustin.jpg|thumb|Alexander Vustin (2008)]]\nVustin's works were published by [[Hans Sikorski]].<ref name=\"Sikorski\" />\n* ''Three Poems of Moses Teif'' for bass and piano, in Russian, translated by [[Yunna Moritz]], (1965)\n* String Quartet (1966)\n* Symphony (1969)\n* ''Three Toropets songs'' for piano (1972)\n* Nocturnes for chamber ensemble and high voice in three movements (1972\u20131982)\n* ''Sonata for six'' for piccolo, flute, clarinet, viola, cello, and 5 string double bass (1973\n* ''Lamento'' for piano (1974)\n* ''Toropets Songs'' for ensemble (1975\n* ''The Word'' for winds and percussions, dedicated. text by Fried (1975)\n* Capriccio (tunes from the collection of M.

Another striking piece, ''Blessed are the Poor in Spirit'' for boy-soprano (or counter-tenor) accompanied by a chamber ensemble was composed in 1988 to the text from Matthew 5:3\u20138.\n\nHis opera ''[[The Devil in Love (opera)|The Devil in Love]]'', to the Russian libretto by [[Vladimir Khachaturov]] after the novel ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|The Devil in Love]]'' by [[Jacques Cazotte]], the result of 15 years of labour, (1975\u20131989) is probably one of the most important of his works. Its musical material nourished the dozens of compositions written in around the same period. The world premiere of the opera took place on 15 February 2019 at the [[Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre]] under [[Vladimir Jurowski]], conductor.\n\nThe works of Alexander Vustin are often included in the programmes of major festivals, such as the \"Kremerata Musica\", Tage f\u00fcr Neue Musik (Z\u00fcrich), Holland Festival, the 14th Musik Biennale Berlin, Pres\u00e8nce 93 (Paris), Melos-Ethos (Bratislava), Maraton Soudobe Hudby (Prague), Donaueschinger Musiktage and Deutsche Kammerphilarmonie (Germany), Kammermusikfest Lockenhaus (Austria), Moscow Forum, and Moscow Autumn (Russia). Among performers of his music are the conductors [[Vladimir Jurowski]], [[Reinbert de Leeuw]], [[Lev Markiz]], [[Eri Klas]], [[Igor Dronov]], [[Alexander Lazarev]], [[Vitaly Kataev]], [[Gidon Kremer]], [[Martyn Brabbins]], and [[Cristoph Hagel]]. Ensembles include [[Kremerata Baltica]], Amsterdam Wind Orchestra, Sch\u00f6nberg Ensemble, Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and Nieuw Sinfonietta Amsterdam (Netherlands), the Mark Pekasky Percussion Ensemble, Studio New Music, Ensemble of Soloists of the Bolshoi Theatre, the Moscow Contemporary Music Ensemble, and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nHe died on 19 April 2020 from pneumonia.<ref>[https://rg.ru/2020/04/19/ot-pnevmonii-umer-kompozitor-aleksandr-vustin.html \u041e\u0442 \u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0412\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d], rg.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Wustin.jpg|thumb|Alexander Vustin (2008)]]\nVustin's works were published by [[Hans Sikorski]].<ref cite=\"Sikorski\" />\n* ''Three Poems of Moses Teif'' for bass and piano, in Russian, translated by [[Yunna Moritz]], (1965)\n* String Quartet (1966)\n* Symphony (1969)\n* ''Three Toropets songs'' for piano (1972)\n* Nocturnes for chamber ensemble and high voice in three movements (1972\u20131982)\n* ''Sonata for six'' for piccolo, flute, clarinet, viola, cello, and 5 string double bass (1973\n* ''Lamento'' for piano (1974)\n* ''Toropets Songs'' for ensemble (1975\n* ''The Word'' for winds and percussions, dedicated. text by Fried (1975)\n* Capriccio (tunes from the collection of M.

Parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] sell [[Johnsonville Foods|Johnsonville Brats]], a toasted hot dog bun with a Johnsonville [[bratwurst]] topped with spicy mustard and onions. Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].\n\nHawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald\u2019s Saimin &#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[lingui\u00e7a|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with [[haupia]] pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers. In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O-Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\nUnlike Mexico, several Puerto Rican McDonald's restaurants serve fish products, although fish is not listed on McDonald's Puerto Rico's official website. Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\nA popular Australian McDonald's menu item is the McOz Burger.

USD 12.00) for the burger alone, it is one of the most expensive McDonald's burgers worldwide.\n\n===Ukraine===\nUkraine features the [[McLavash]] sandwich on its menus in the southern part of the country, which is served in flatbread. It has two spicy beef patties, some greens, onion and tomato. The McLavash is also served in some other nearby countries.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\nBritish and Irish McDonald's serve the Chicken Legend, a chicken breast coated in seasoned batter either spicy tomato salsa, BBQ Sauce or mayonnaise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/content/ukhome/product_nutrition.chicken.243.chicken-legend-with-bacon-cool-mayo.html |title=Product Nutrition |publisher=McDonalds.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In June 2011, [[Deli Choices]], a line of sandwich rolls with fillings, was released in the UK.

In 2015, McDonald's released a limited edition burger in the Republic of Ireland called the McM\u00f3r. In 2016, this burger was brought back for six weeks. It features Ballymaloe Relish, Charleville cheddar and a potato bun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.ie/iehome/food/full_menu/beef/mc-mor.html |title=McM\u00f3r burger |publisher=McDonalds.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-04-20}}</ref> In 2016, McDonald's launched the brand new BBQ Smokehouse Range of burgers.

A series of burgers intending to represent various American locales has been released under the ''Great Taste of America'' range.

Not all of these burgers resemble their respective local cuisines.<ref>{{cite news |title=McDonald's Introduces the UK to Incorrect Tastes of America |last=Wheeler |first=Robin |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2011/06/mcdonalds_introduces_the_uk_to.php |newspaper=[[The Riverfront Times]] |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527012859/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2011/06/mcdonalds_introduces_the_uk_to.php |archive-date=2012-05-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> British and Irish McDonald's also released a series of burgers representing several different countries in the world. These have included Australia, South Africa, Canada and Mexico. Several Summer and Winter menus have been launched. Also, McDonald's has launched several kinds of McFlurrys over the years, such as [[Cornetto (ice cream)|Cornetto]], [[Cadbury]] brands like Dairy Milk (which is available all year around) and the [[Creme Egg]], which is only available around [[Easter]].\n\nIn 2019 McDonald's released a limited-time edition of the Big Mac called the ''Grand Big Mac Bacon'', which is essentially a larger Big Mac with added bacon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Big Mac Bacon|date=2019-01-28|accessdate=2019-01-31|url=https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/product/grand-big-mac-bacon.html}}</ref>\n\nMcDonald's UK also offers a range of premium burgers known as the ''Signature Collection'', consisting of three burgers: ''The Classic'', ''The Spicy'' and ''The BBQ''. Each comes with a thicker patty made from higher quality beef which takes longer to cook and is served on a brioche bun.\n\n==North America==\n===Canada===\n{{Main|McDonald's Canada}}\nFrench fries may be substituted with McDonald's version of [[poutine]]. Previously, McDonald's poutine was available widely only in Francophone Canada (Quebec and parts of New Brunswick) and available elsewhere on a more limited basis; however, in December 2013, McDonald's formally announced the nationwide availability of poutine at all of its Canadian restaurants, due to popular demand.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mcdonald-s-poutine-hitting-menus-across-canada-1.2454323 \"McDonald's poutine hitting menus across Canada\"], CBC News, 06 December 2013.</ref> Quebec also saw the release of the limited-time 1967 Burger, commemorating Canada's first McDonald's franchise. Deli Choices were introduced throughout Canada in 2006. Unique to Canadian McDonald's locations is the McMini, miniature sandwiches with grilled or crispy chicken; flavors include [[Pesto]] Chicken (later replaced by Zesty [[Mango]]) and Spicy Thai.<ref>{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2011/11/mcmini-thai-chilli-chicken-and-pesto.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Chicken McMini Thai Chilli and Pesto \u2013 Lasalle, Canada \u2013 May 2010 |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> As in the United States, the McRib periodically appears on the menu for limited runs.  The crispy chicken patty used in the McChicken sandwich sold in Canada uses both white and dark meat \u2013 it is essentially the same size and taste as the original McChicken that first appeared in the US in 1980.\n\nSeasonal items previously available in McDonald's in Canada include the McLobster, a [[lobster roll]], available in the [[Maritime Provinces]], called ''McHomard'' in French.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-biz-mcdonalds-mchomard-canada,0,4348743.photo | work=Chicago Tribune | title=McHomard \u2013 Canada}}</ref> Regionally a blueberry-shortbread McFlurry is also available.  Discontinued items in Canadian McDonald's include pizzas, including a [[calzone]]-style \"McPizza.\"\nThe McFlurry Originated in New Brunswick.\n\n===Mexico===\nMexican McDonald's locations do not serve fish, except during the period of Lent. Special items at these locations have included the Flaming Hot [[Doritos]] Quarter Pounder and the BBQ Double Burger. For breakfast, Mexican McDonald's locations serve the McMollete, which is made on an English muffin spread with beans, topped with a slice of melted cheese and pico de gallo.<ref name=johnson>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-caters-to-local-palettes-2011-1?op=1|accessdate=3 August 2012|title=Check out the awesome meals you can buy at McDonald's around the world|author=Johnson, Robert|date=22 January 2011|work=Business Insider}}</ref> Mexican locations also serve a version of the McSkillet burrito known as the \"McBurrito\".\n\n===United States===\nMcDonald's restaurants in the United States of America offer various types of [[shellfish]] dishes on a regional basis, such as seasonal [[lobster]] rolls in [[New England]] and [[crab cakes]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. Parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] sell [[Johnsonville Foods|Johnsonville Brats]], a toasted hot dog bun with a Johnsonville [[bratwurst]] topped with spicy mustard and onions. Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].\n\nHawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald\u2019s Saimin &#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[lingui\u00e7a|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with [[haupia]] pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers. In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O-Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\nUnlike Mexico, several Puerto Rican McDonald's restaurants serve fish products, although fish is not listed on McDonald's Puerto Rico's official website. Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\nA popular Australian McDonald's menu item is the McOz Burger. Previous products have included: Shaker Fries, similar to Japan's Shaka Shaka Chicken, and has had many variants of seasoning ranging from Cheeseburger, Big Mac and Spicy; a [[BLT]]; the Mc[[Beefsteak]], promoted by [[country music]] singer [[Lee Kernaghan]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3WCXJOpv4 |title=McDonalds Commercial \u2013 McBeefsteak |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> the Big [[Kahuna]] Burger, served with pineapple; the Romano Burger, a chicken patty with Italian sauce and mozzarella served on an herbed focaccia bun; the [[Tandoor]]i Burger, a chicken patty with lettuce and mint yogurt sauce served on flatbread; and a [[Chive]] [[Omelette]] Roll.\n\nCurrent products have included: Chicken Mcbites, Classic Angus and Aussie BBQ Angus.\n\nEvery so often (typically once a year) the McOz is sold for a limited time.  The McOz is a quarter-pounder burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, mustard, ketchup and the so-called Australian ingredients of [[beetroot]] and cooked onion served on a sesame seed bun.\n\nThe El Maco burger, offered in other markets, was released for a limited time offer last on the 27th of November 2019. These burgers launch alongside Mozzarella Sticks served with El Maco Salsa and an El Maco variant Shaker Fries.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|McDonald's New Zealand}}\n[[File:McDonald's Kiwiburger.jpg|thumb|200px|Kiwiburger]]\nMany McDonald's menu items in New Zealand are similar to those in Australia.

It is also the seat of the [[City Municipality of Maribor]], the seat of the [[Drava Statistical Region|Drava]] statistical region and the [[Eastern Slovenia]] region. Maribor is also the economic, administrative, educational and cultural centre of eastern Slovenia.\n\nMaribor was first mentioned as a castle in 1164, as a settlement in 1209 and as a city in 1254. As most of [[Slovene Lands|Slovene lands]], Maribor was under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule until 1918 when [[Rudolf Maister]] and his men secured the city for the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] which was later renamed to Yugoslavia. In 1991 Maribor became part of independent Slovenia.\n\nMaribor, along with the Portuguese city of [[Guimar\u00e3es]], was selected the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2012.\n\n==Name==\nMaribor was attested in historical sources as ''Marpurch'' circa 1145 (and later as ''Marchburch'', ''Marburc'', and ''Marchpurch''), and is a compound of celtic''marc'' '[[March (territorial entity)|march (borderland), mark military horse, Marca celtic goddess]]' + ''burc'' 'fortress'. In modern times, the town's German name was ''Marburg an der Drau'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ma\u0250\u032fb\u028a\u0250\u032fk \u0294an d\u0250 \u02c8d\u0281a\u028a\u032f|pron}}; literally, 'Marburg on the [[Drava]]'). \n\nThe Slovene name ''Maribor'' is an artificial Slovenized creation, coined by [[Stanko Vraz]] in 1836. Vraz created the name in the spirit of [[Illyrian movement|Illyrianism]] by analogy with the name ''[[Brandenburg]]'' (cf. [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] ''Bramborska''). Locally, the town is known in Slovene as ''Marprk'' or ''Marprog''.<ref name=\"Snoj\">{{cite book |last1=Snoj |first1=Marko |title=Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen |date=2009 |publisher=Modrijan |location=Ljubljana |page=252}}</ref> In addition to its Slovene and German names, the city is also known as ''Marburgum'' in Latin and ''Marburgo'' in Italian.\n\n==History==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 24em\n| align = right\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| fontsize = 86%\n| quote =\n{{flagicon image|Wappen Erzbistum Salzburg.png}} [[Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] (1204\u20131555)<br />\n{{Flag|Habsburg Monarchy|[[Duchy of Styria]]}} (1555\u20131804)<br />\n{{Flag|Austrian Empire}} (1804\u20131867)<br />\n{{Flag|Austria-Hungary}} (1867\u20131918)<br />\n{{flag|State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs}} (1918)<br />\n{{flag|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}} (1918\u20131941)<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of Germany (1935\u20131945).svg}} [[Nazi Germany]] (1941\u20131944)<br />\n{{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}{{refn|Known as: ''Democratic Federal Yugoslavia'' (1944\u20131945); Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (1945\u20131963); Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1963\u20131992)}} (1944\u20131991)<br />\n{{flag|Slovenia}} 1991\u2013Present\n}}\n\n=== Medieval and early modern history ===\n[[File:Vischer - Topographia Ducatus Stiria - 247 Marburg - Maribor.jpg|left|thumb|Maribor in the 17th century.

Thus, it was mainly known by its [[German language|Austrian]] name {{lang|de|Marburg an der Drau}}. According to the last [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] census in 1910, the city of Maribor and the suburbs Studenci (''Brunndorf''), Pobre\u017eje (''Pobersch''), Tezno (''Thesen''), Radvanje (''Rothwein''), Kr\u010devina (''Kartschowin''), and Ko\u0161aki (''Leitersberg'') was inhabited by 31,995 Austrian Germans (including German-speaking [[Jews]]) and only 6,151 ethnic Slovenes. The surrounding area however was populated almost entirely by Slovenes, although many Austrian Germans lived in smaller towns like [[Ptuj]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]] many Slovenes in the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] were detained on suspicion of being enemies of the Austrian Empire. This led to distrust between Austrian Germans and Slovenes. After the collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Maribor was claimed by both the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and [[Republic of German-Austria|German Austria]]. On 1 November 1918, a meeting was held by Colonel Anton Holik in the Melje barracks, where it was decided that the German-speaking city should be part of German Austria. Ethnic Slovene Major [[Rudolf Maister]], who was present at the meeting, denounced the decision and organised Slovenian military units that were able to seize control of the city. All Austrian officers and soldiers were disarmed and demobilised to the new state of German Austria. The city council then held a secret meeting, where it was decided to do whatever possible to regain Maribor for German Austria. They organised a military unit called the Green Guard (''Schutzwehr''), and approximately 400 well-armed soldiers of this unit opposed the pro-Slovenian and pro-[[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Major Maister. Slovenian troops surprised and disarmed the Green Guard early in the morning of 23 November. Thereafter, there was no threat to the authority of Rudolf Maister in the city.\n\nOn 27 January 1919, Austrian Germans gathered to await the [[United States]] peace delegation at the city's marketplace were fired upon by Slovenian troops, who apparently feared the thousands of ethnic German citizens. Nine citizens were killed and some eighteen were seriously wounded;{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} who had actually ordered the shooting has never been unequivocally established. German sources accused Maister's troops of shooting without cause. In turn Slovene witnesses such as Maks Pohar claimed that the Austrian Germans attacked the Slovenian soldiers guarding the Maribor city hall. Regardless of who was responsible, the Austrian German victims all had been without any arms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The German-language media called the incident ''[[Marburg's Bloody Sunday]]''.\n\nAs Maribor was now firmly in the hands of the Slovenian forces and surrounded completely by Slovenian territory; the city had been recognised as part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] without a [[Referendum|plebiscite]] in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 10 September 1919 between the victors and German Austria.\n\nAfter 1918, most of Maribor's Austrian Germans left the Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for [[Austria]]. These included the German-speaking officials who had not been from the region. Austrian German schools, clubs, and organizations were ordered closed by the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], even though ethnic Germans still made up more than 25% of the city's total population as late as the 1930s. A policy of [[cultural assimilation]] was pursued in Yugoslavia against the Austrian German minority similar to the [[Germanisation|Germanization]] policy followed by Austria against its Slovene minority in [[Carinthia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, in the late 1930s the policy was abandoned and the Austrian German minority's position improved significantly in an attempt to gain better diplomatic relations with [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n===World War II and aftermath===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0723, Marburg-Drau, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] on the [[Old Bridge (Maribor)|Old Bridge]] in Maribor, Yugoslavia in 1941.]]\n\nIn 1941 [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]], the predominantly Yugoslav part of Styria, was annexed by Nazi Germany.

Immediately after the occupation, Nazi Germany began mass expulsions of Slovenes to the [[Independent State of Croatia]], [[Serbia]], and later to the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration and work camps]] in Germany. The Nazi goal was to re-Germanize the population of Lower Styria after the war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Many Slovene patriots were taken hostage and some are believed to have been shot later in the prisons of Maribor and Graz.

Of the remains of city walls surrounding the old downtown, the most prominent are the [[Judgement Tower]], the [[Maribor Water Tower|Water Tower]], and the Jewish Tower. [[Maribor Cathedral]] was built in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] in the 13th century. [[Maribor Synagogue]] was built in the 14th century, and is the second oldest synagogue of Europe. Today it serves as a centre for cultural activities. Other prominent Medieval buildings are [[Maribor Castle]], [[Betnava Mansion|Betnava Castle]], and the ruins of [[Upper Maribor Castle]] on Pyramid Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maribor-pohorje.si/defence-towers.aspx |title=Slovenia-Maribor: Defence Towers |publisher=Maribor-pohorje.si |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> [[Maribor Town Hall|Town Hall]] was constructed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], and the [[Plague Column (Maribor)|Plague Column]] in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque style]].\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, plans were made for a new modern business, residential and entertainment district, called the [[Dravska Vrata|Drava Gate]] ({{lang|sl|Dravska vrata}}) and nicknamed the ''Maribor Manhattan''. The project includes many new exclusive residential apartments, offices and conference halls, a green and recreational space, and other structures. It also includes a {{convert|111|m|abbr=on}} tall skyscraper that would be the tallest building in Slovenia. Due to lack of finances, the project has been postponed.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Studenci Footbridge]] ({{lang|sl|Studen\u0161ka brv}}) was renovated according to the design of the Ponting company. The design was awarded that year at the 3rd International Footbridge Conference in [[Porto]].\n\nIn 2010, Maribor organised an international architectural competition ''ECC Maribor 2012 \u2013 Drava 2012'' to gather proposals for the design and reconstruction of the Drava banks, the construction of a new art gallery, and for a new footbridge. Its jury received about 400 proposals for the three different projects. The footbridge and the river embankments will be built in the near future, but the art gallery was replaced with a cultural center [[MAKS (cultural centre)|MAKS]], which is currently under construction.\n\nThe construction of a new modern [[Faculty of Medicine (Maribor)|Faculty of Medicine]] started in 2011 near the Drava River. It was designed by architect [[Boris Podrecca]] and was completed in 2013.\n\nThere are plans to renovate the [[Maribor Public Library]] and [[Town Hall Square (Maribor)|Town Hall Square]] ({{lang|sl|Rotov\u0161ki trg}}).

It is suggested that at that time there was already a Jewish quarter in the city. The Jewish ghetto was located in the southeastern part of the city and it comprised, at its peak, several main streets in the city centre including part of the main city square. The ghetto had a [[Maribor Synagogue|synagogue]], a Jewish cemetery and also a [[Talmud]] school. The Jewish community of Maribor was numerically at its apex around 1410. After 1450 the circumstances changed dramatically: increasing competition that coincided with an economic crisis dealt a severe blow to the economic activities that were crucial to their economic success. According to a decree issued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian&nbsp;I]] in 1496, Jews were forced to leave the city of Maribor. Restrictions on settlement and business for Jews remained in place until 1861.<ref>[http://www.jewishcommunity.si/jss/ENG-zgodovina.asp Jewish community of Slovenia]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128114733/http://www.jewishcommunity.si/jss/ENG-zgodovina.asp |date=January 28, 2010 }}</ref> From late spring 1941, after Lower Styria was annexed by the Third Reich, the Jews of Maribor were deported to concentration camps.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:UniverzaMaribor.jpg|thumb|left|Headquarters of the [[University of Maribor]]]]\n[[File:Maribor Zametovka vine and daughter.png|thumb|left|The more-than-400-year-old \u017dametovka grapevine growing outside the Old Vine House in Maribor.

There is also mime, magic shows are being held and acrobats perform during the festival.\n\nMaribor is known for wine and culinary specialities of international and Slovene cuisine (mushroom soup with buckwheat mush, tripe, sour soup, sausages with Sauerkraut, cheese dumplings, apple strudel, special cheese cake called [[gibanica]]). There are also many popular restaurants with [[Serbian cuisine]]. The Vinag Wine Cellar ({{lang|sl|Vinagova vinska klet}}), with the area of {{convert|20.000|m2|abbr=on}} and the length of {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}}, keeps 5,5 millions litres of wine.

Maribor is also the economic, administrative, educational and cultural centre of eastern Slovenia.\n\nMaribor was first mentioned as a castle in 1164, as a settlement in 1209 and as a city in 1254. As most of [[Slovene Lands|Slovene lands]], Maribor was under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] rule until 1918 when [[Rudolf Maister]] and his men secured the city for the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] which was later renamed to Yugoslavia. In 1991 Maribor became part of independent Slovenia.\n\nMaribor, along with the Portuguese city of [[Guimar\u00e3es]], was selected the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2012.\n\n==Name==\nMaribor was attested in historical sources as ''Marpurch'' circa 1145 (and later as ''Marchburch'', ''Marburc'', and ''Marchpurch''), and is a compound of [[Middle High German]] ''march'' '[[March (territorial entity)|march (borderland)]]' + ''burc'' 'fortress'. In modern times, the town's German name was ''Marburg an der Drau'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ma\u0250\u032fb\u028a\u0250\u032fk \u0294an d\u0250 \u02c8d\u0281a\u028a\u032f|pron}}; literally, 'Marburg on the [[Drava]]'). \n\nThe Slovene name ''Maribor'' is an artificial Slovenized creation, coined by [[Stanko Vraz]] in 1836. Vraz created the name in the spirit of [[Illyrian movement|Illyrianism]] by analogy with the name ''[[Brandenburg]]'' (cf. [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]] ''Bramborska''). Locally, the town is known in Slovene as ''Marprk'' or ''Marprog''.<ref name=\"Snoj\">{{cite book |last1=Snoj |first1=Marko |title=Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen |date=2009 |publisher=Modrijan |location=Ljubljana |page=252}}</ref> In addition to its Slovene and German names, the city is also known as ''Marburgum'' in Latin and ''Marburgo'' in Italian.\n\n==History==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 24em\n| align = right\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| fontsize = 86%\n| quote =\n{{flagicon image|Wappen Erzbistum Salzburg.png}} [[Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]] (1204\u20131555)<br />\n{{Flag|Habsburg Monarchy|[[Duchy of Styria]]}} (1555\u20131804)<br />\n{{Flag|Austrian Empire}} (1804\u20131867)<br />\n{{Flag|Austria-Hungary}} (1867\u20131918)<br />\n{{flag|State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs}} (1918)<br />\n{{flag|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}} (1918\u20131941)<br />\n{{flagicon image|Flag of Germany (1935\u20131945).svg}} [[Nazi Germany]] (1941\u20131944)<br />\n{{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}{{refn|Known as: ''Democratic Federal Yugoslavia'' (1944\u20131945); Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (1945\u20131963); Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1963\u20131992)}} (1944\u20131991)<br />\n{{flag|Slovenia}} 1991\u2013Present\n}}\n\n=== Medieval and early modern history ===\n[[File:Vischer - Topographia Ducatus Stiria - 247 Marburg - Maribor.jpg|left|thumb|Maribor in the 17th century.

Thus, it was mainly known by its [[German language|Austrian]] name {{lang|de|Marburg an der Drau}}. According to the last [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] census in 1910, the city of Maribor and the suburbs Studenci (''Brunndorf''), Pobre\u017eje (''Pobersch''), Tezno (''Thesen''), Radvanje (''Rothwein''), Kr\u010devina (''Kartschowin''), and Ko\u0161aki (''Leitersberg'') was inhabited by 31,995 Austrian Germans (including German-speaking [[Jews]]) and only 6,151 ethnic Slovenes. The surrounding area however was populated almost entirely by Slovenes, although many Austrian Germans lived in smaller towns like [[Ptuj]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]] many Slovenes in the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]] were detained on suspicion of being enemies of the Austrian Empire. This led to distrust between Austrian Germans and Slovenes. After the collapse of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Maribor was claimed by both the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and [[Republic of German-Austria|German Austria]]. On 1 November 1918, a meeting was held by Colonel Anton Holik in the Melje barracks, where it was decided that the German-speaking city should be part of German Austria. Ethnic Slovene Major [[Rudolf Maister]], who was present at the meeting, denounced the decision and organised Slovenian military units that were able to seize control of the city. All Austrian officers and soldiers were disarmed and demobilised to the new state of German Austria. The city council then held a secret meeting, where it was decided to do whatever possible to regain Maribor for German Austria. They organised a military unit called the Green Guard (''Schutzwehr''), and approximately 400 well-armed soldiers of this unit opposed the pro-Slovenian and pro-[[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Major Maister. Slovenian troops surprised and disarmed the Green Guard early in the morning of 23 November. Thereafter, there was no threat to the authority of Rudolf Maister in the city.\n\nOn 27 January 1919, Austrian Germans gathered to await the [[United States]] peace delegation at the city's marketplace were fired upon by Slovenian troops, who apparently feared the thousands of ethnic German citizens. Nine citizens were killed and some eighteen were seriously wounded;{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} who had actually ordered the shooting has never been unequivocally established. German sources accused Maister's troops of shooting without cause. In turn Slovene witnesses such as Maks Pohar claimed that the Austrian Germans attacked the Slovenian soldiers guarding the Maribor city hall. Regardless of who was responsible, the Austrian German victims all had been without any arms.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The German-language media called the incident ''[[Marburg's Bloody Sunday]]''.\n\nAs Maribor was now firmly in the hands of the Slovenian forces and surrounded completely by Slovenian territory; the city had been recognised as part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] without a [[Referendum|plebiscite]] in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 10 September 1919 between the victors and German Austria.\n\nAfter 1918, most of Maribor's Austrian Germans left the Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for [[Austria]]. These included the German-speaking officials who had not been from the region. Austrian German schools, clubs, and organizations were ordered closed by the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], even though ethnic Germans still made up more than 25% of the city's total population as late as the 1930s. A policy of [[cultural assimilation]] was pursued in Yugoslavia against the Austrian German minority similar to the [[Germanisation|Germanization]] policy followed by Austria against its Slovene minority in [[Carinthia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, in the late 1930s the policy was abandoned and the Austrian German minority's position improved significantly in an attempt to gain better diplomatic relations with [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n===World War II and aftermath===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 121-0723, Marburg-Drau, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] on the [[Old Bridge (Maribor)|Old Bridge]] in Maribor, Yugoslavia in 1941.]]\n\nIn 1941 [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]], the predominantly Yugoslav part of Styria, was annexed by Nazi Germany.

According to a decree issued by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian&nbsp;I]] in 1496, Jews were forced to leave the city of Maribor. Restrictions on settlement and business for Jews remained in place until 1861.<ref>[http://www.jewishcommunity.si/jss/ENG-zgodovina.asp Jewish community of Slovenia]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128114733/http://www.jewishcommunity.si/jss/ENG-zgodovina.asp |date=January 28, 2010 }}</ref> From late spring 1941, after Lower Styria was annexed by the Third Reich, the Jews of Maribor were deported to concentration camps.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:UniverzaMaribor.jpg|thumb|left|Headquarters of the [[University of Maribor]]]]\n[[File:Maribor Zametovka vine and daughter.png|thumb|left|The more-than-400-year-old \u017dametovka grapevine growing outside the Old Vine House in Maribor.

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to dddddddddddddddddddexchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985. It covered only binary floating-point arithmetic.\n\nA new version, [[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], was published in August 2008, following a seven-year revision process, chaired by Dan Zuras and edited by [[Mike Cowlishaw]]. It replaced both IEEE 754-1985 (binary floating-point arithmetic) and [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]]. The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal.  To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n\nThe international standard '''ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011''' (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through [[ISO/IEC JTC1|JTC1]]/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|title=FW: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)|website=grouper.ieee.org|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027190846/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> and published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required.

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined.\n\nThe encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats similarly encodes the sign, exponent, and significand, but two different bit-level representations are defined.  Interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the representation in use is required.  The two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits (using [[densely packed decimal]]) or alternatively as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical binary representations.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985.

The binary formats in the original standard are included in this new standard along with three new basic formats, one binary and two decimal.  To conform to the current standard, an implementation must implement at least one of the basic formats as both an arithmetic format and an interchange format.\n\nThe international standard '''ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011''' (with content identical to IEEE 754-2008) has been approved for adoption through [[ISO/IEC JTC1|JTC1]]/SC 25 under the ISO/IEEE PSDO Agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|title=FW: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 (IEEE Std 754-2008)|website=grouper.ieee.org|accessdate=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027190846/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg04167.html|archive-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> and published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469|title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 - Information technology -- Microprocessor Systems -- Floating-Point arithmetic|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe current version, IEEE 754-2019 published in July 2019, is derived from and replaces IEEE 754-2008, following a revision process started in September 2015, chaired by David G.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name                                                   !! Common name        !!

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined.\n\nThe encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats similarly encodes the sign, exponent, and significand, but two different bit-level representations are defined.  Interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the representation in use is required.  The two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits (using [[densely packed decimal]]) or alternatively as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical binary representations.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].
