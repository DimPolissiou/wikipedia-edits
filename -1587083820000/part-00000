There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] described [[gravitational acceleration]]. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]]. India has always known about gravity, so you could say that Sir Isaac Newton stole India's Idea and Patented it on his name...\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.\n\n==Antiquity==\nVarious ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] describe some of the everyday effects of gravity;<ref>{{cite web |last=Deem |first=Rich |title=The Word 'Gravity' Never Appears in the Bible |url=https://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/gravity.html |website=God and Science |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=25 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Scriptures Mention Gravity 1500 Years Before Isaac Newton: Former ISRO Chief G Madhavan Nair |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-scriptures-mention-gravity-1500-years-before-isaac-newton-former-isro-chief-g-madhavan-nair-741360 |website=NDTV |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref> some religious scholars interpret particular scriptures as describing the cosmic force of gravity while not explicitly naming it as such.<ref>{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Don |title=Gravity |url=https://answersingenesis.org/physics/gravity/ |website=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=1 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman world===\n{{See also|Aristotelian physics}}\nIn the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

[[specific gravity]]):\n\n<blockquote>If the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory. However, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations still use Newton's equations because they are easier to work with and sufficiently accurate for many everyday applications.\n\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity.

However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature [[action at a distance]].\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory that light 'bends']]\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as \"the happiest thought of my life\", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no [[gravitational field]]. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]\u2014individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.\n\n===General relativity===\n{{Main|Introduction to general relativity}}\nIn general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of to a force.  The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times.\n[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] (f.&nbsp;4th century&nbsp;BC) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] (f.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;BC) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force.\n\nThe [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic physicists]], starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b]] described [[gravitational acceleration]]. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his [[law of universal gravitation]].\nNewton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when [[Albert Einstein]] developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.\n\n==Antiquity==\nVarious ancient texts such as the [[Bible]] describe some of the everyday effects of gravity;<ref>{{cite web |last=Deem |first=Rich |title=The Word 'Gravity' Never Appears in the Bible |url=https://www.godandscience.org/doctrine/gravity.html |website=God and Science |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=25 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Indian Scriptures Mention Gravity 1500 Years Before Isaac Newton: Former ISRO Chief G Madhavan Nair |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-scriptures-mention-gravity-1500-years-before-isaac-newton-former-isro-chief-g-madhavan-nair-741360 |website=NDTV |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=21 February 2015}}</ref> some religious scholars interpret particular scriptures as describing the cosmic force of gravity while not explicitly naming it as such.<ref>{{cite web |last=DeYoung |first=Don |title=Gravity |url=https://answersingenesis.org/physics/gravity/ |website=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=8 August 2019 |date=1 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Greco-Roman world===\n{{See also|Aristotelian physics}}\nIn the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

[[specific gravity]]):\n\n<blockquote>If the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord.

In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>\n\nNewton's original formula was:\n:<math>{\\rm Force\\,of\\,gravity} \\propto \\frac{\\rm mass\\,of\\,object\\,1\\,\\times\\,mass\\,of\\,object\\,2}{\\rm distance\\,from\\,centers^2}</math>\n\nwhere the symbol <math>\\propto</math> means \"is proportional to\".\nTo make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them.  This gravitational constant was first accurately measured in 1797 by Henry Cavendish.{{efn|name=constant}}\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets.  Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier's sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify; in the same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.\n\nYears later, it was another discrepancy in a planet's orbit that showed Newton's theory to be inaccurate. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] could not be accounted for entirely under Newtonian gravity, and all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) were fruitless. This issue was resolved in 1915 by Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounted for the discrepancy in Mercury's orbit, thereby superseding Newton's theory.

Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity.

However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature [[action at a distance]].\n\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success, which confirmed [[Einstein]]'s theory that light 'bends']]\n\nIn 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as \"the happiest thought of my life\", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no [[gravitational field]]. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration. Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed this idea, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his [[general theory of relativity]], which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]\u2014individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.\n\n===General relativity===\n{{Main|Introduction to general relativity}}\nIn general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of to a force.  The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion.  The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other.\nTo deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s.  The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m black hole|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].\n* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson\u2013Walker coordinates|Robertson\u2013Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.\n\nGeneral relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:\n* General relativity accounts for the anomalous [[perihelion precession of Mercury]].\n* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.\n* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson\u2013Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.\n* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele\u2013Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].\n* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.\n* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].\n** In 2015, the [[LIGO]] experiments directly [[First observation of gravitational waves|detected gravitational radiation]] from [[Binary black hole|two colliding black holes]], making this the first direct observation of both gravitational waves and black holes.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\">{{cite journal |collaboration=LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration |last1=Abbott |first1=Benjamin P. |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

Edwards' boxing career didn\u2019t begin until he moved Southeast to South Wales in the [[Rhondda|Rhondda Valley]] where he began his professional boxing career around 1913 at the age of twenty-seven in his new hometown of Porth, Wales.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\">{{cite web|title=Llew Edwards|url=http://www.welshboxers.com/hall-of-fame/llew-edwards/|publisher=Welsh Boxing Hall of Fame|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> One of his earliest opponents was Billy Phillips, an average Welsh bantamweight who fell to Edwards in April and January of 1913 in Porth and Tonypandy in two eight round points decisions.\n\n[[Image:Jim Driscoll portrait BNF.jpg|upright=.8|left|thumb|Featherweight Jim Driscoll]]Britain's 1910 featherweight champion [[Jim Driscoll]], a fellow Welsh boxer from nearby Cardiff, acted as a mentor to Edwards in his career.  Driscoll fought many of the same boxers, particularly Owen Moran for the British Empire featherweight title. Driscoll was twelve years older and able to share his boxing experience with his friend and fellow Welshman Edwards.  His stellar boxing career was over in 1913, just as Edwards's was beginning his career and already showing remarkable potential.<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/><ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/> \n\n[[Image:Llew Edwards.jpeg|upright=1.1|right|thumb|Welsh boxers;Edwards front row right, and Driscoll, immediately behind and left, [[Jimmy Wilde]] immediate left]]\nEdwards was soon traveling North to thriving Liverpool and later East to London to face opponents such as Lancashire resident Harold Walker, a competent featherweight just short of contender status, whom he defeated handily in a seventh round technical knockout at Liverpool Stadium on 26 March 1913.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\nEdwards defeated featherweight contender Alec Lambert in a seventh round knockout on 4 May 1914 at London's prestigious National Sporting Club at Covent Gardens. In pre-fight publicity, mentor Jim Driscoll accurately touted Edwards as the next British featherweight champion, though it would take Edwards another year to achieve the title.  Lambert boxed in the traditional, upstanding British style and kept a light leading left typical of amateurs, but he had developed a strong punch as a professional.  Edwards expertly evaded Lambert's fierce swings and uppercuts with a superior defense characteristic of his future style.  He boxed at a great pace and Lambert had no answer for his repeated short left that stopped him consistently.  Edwards's footwork, another characteristic strength, gave him better leverage in his punches and Lambert was down twice for six and eight second counts in the seventh.  As their boxer was unable to resume the fight shortly after a devastating hook in the chest, Lambert's handlers stopped the bout.<ref>\"LLew Edwards V.

On 5 April, he took the Orient Lightweight Title in a ten round points decision against Dencio Cabanella.  Cabanella took the first, fifth, and seventh, but Edwards took the remaining seven rounds against his lighter opponent and \"pounded Cabanella all over the ring in round ten, having him at his mercy when the final bell rang\".  He had previously knocked out Edward Duarte on March 26, in a third round sweep, with vicious one-twos, and two rights to the body that sent his opponent to his knees where he was counted out.<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/>\n\nIn his last fight in the Philippines, on 9 August 1919, Edwards defeated Iron Bux, in a convincing ninth round TKO.  According to the ''Manila Daily Bulletin'',  Edwards handed Bux \"the worst licking that he had ever received. Although the Iron Man was never off his feet, he was battered badly, and suffered eyecuts that rendered him nearly helpless by the time that the fight was halted. Edwards was as effective at long range as he had already proved to be at infighting. He showed a clever defense against Bux's attacks.\" Edwards returned to Australia on August 27.<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/>\n\nFor a period in the Philippines, Edwards acted as a boxing advisor to International Boxing Hall of Famer and world flyweight champion [[Francisco Guilledo]] (1901-1925), a 5' 1\" Filipino, better known under his boxing name Pancho Villa.\u201d  Guilledo was never knocked out, and found fame when he won his world flyweight title in America in 1922.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\n====Boxing decline during brief trip to America====\nOn 26 February 1920, a taller, younger, and stronger Richie Mitchell knocked down Edwards in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the sixth and his handlers threw in the towel before the bell for the seventh. In all, Mitchell floored him for a nine count in the second and sixth, and for a count of two in the third.  Though showing his best efforts in the fourth, Edwards could do no damage.<ref>\"Ritchie Mitchell Lands Knockout\", ''The Capital Times'', pg. 20, 27 February 1920</ref> \n\n=====Brief return to Britain to box=====\nReturning briefly to Britain on 28 May 1920, Edwards faced Johnny Regan at Carbrook, Yorkshire, reversing his loss against Mitchell and winning in the third of twenty rounds.  Regrettably for his fans, who had dwindled in his absence during the war, it would be his last British bout.  Returning to America on September 3, 1920, Edwards won a ten round newspaper decision against Johnny Noye at Minneapolis's Nicolete Park.  Edwards won with only a slight lead over Noye, a boxer he would have beaten convincingly five years earlier.<ref>\"Lllew Edwards Wallops Noye\", ''Los Angeles Times'', Los Angeles, California, pg. 9, 5 September 1920</ref>\n\nEdwards faced Jack Lawler on 30 July 1920, in Milwaukee, winning in a ten round newspaper decision.  In the pre-flight publicity, Edwards was praised for his determination, and for being \"of the sort who keeps tearing in.  Despite the fact that he was dropped several times by Ritchie Mitchell in their previous bout, Llew arose each time and with a bull-like rush started after the Milwaukee blonde(Mitchell).  He is a game ringster.\"  Lawler was described as a mauler, but he showed little of it against Edwards.<ref>\"Star Boxing Bell Offered\", ''The Journal Times'', Racine, Wisconsin, pg. 8, 30 July 1920</ref>  The bout was described as a slow and uninteresting affair, but after a string of recent fights, both boxers may have been feeling each other out and wary of the other's skills.  Lawler was said to stall until the ninth and tenth rounds.  In a close bout, Edwards was given the third, fourth, and seventh, with Lawler the fifth and ninth with the rest even.  Edwards took the lead throughout the bout, and though he had many of his punches blocked, he landed enough to take the bout.<ref>\"Llew Edwards Trims Lawler\", ''The Capital Times\", Madison, Wisconsin, pg. 8, 31 July 1920</ref>\n\nEdwards remained boxing in the United States through late 1920, when he lost to Clonie Tait at Nicolete Park on 12 November 1920 in a second round TKO. He was down eleven times before his manager threw in the towel.  It appeared clear the Welsh boxer was outclassed, tiring, and facing a painful decline in his boxing career by the end of his American tour.<ref>\"Ritchie Mitchell Lands Knockout\", ''The Capital Times'', pg. 20, 27 February 1920</ref>\n\nEdwards career was now clearly in decline but he was in need of cash and needed more fights.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\n===Return to Australia and career decline===\nOn his return to Australia, he defeated French-born Eugene Volaire in a twenty round points decision in Brisbane on 5 March 1921.  On 4 April 1921, in a non-title bout, Edwards defeated Sid Godfrey, a highly rated future Australian lightweight title holder five years younger, in an important twenty round points decision at Sydney Stadium.  The ''Sydney Daily Telegraph'' called the match, \"a contest full of fight with both men displaying a scientific knowledge above the ordinary, speed, punching power and tenacity.\"   Even near the end of his career Edwards could fight with style, but his decline would seem evident against more skilled American competitors on the rise like Harry Stone who had learned the game from tougher New York competitors.  Ironically, the following month Godfrey would take the Australian lightweight title from Stone, a boxer with whom Edwards would never defeat again.<ref>\"Leicester vs. Gloucester\", ''The Times'', London, England, 4 April 1921</ref>\n\n===Final loss of the Australian lightweight title to Harry Stone, 1921===\n[[File:Harry Stone LCCN2014696871 (cropped) 2.jpg|upright=.99|right|thumb|Exceptional New York Lightweight, Harry Stone]]\nEdwards mounted a last defense of the Australian lightweight title before an impressive crowd of 9000 on 23 April 1921 in a twenty round bout in Melbourne, Australia, against frequent but dangerous rival New York Jewish boxer [[Harry Stone (boxer)|Harry Stone]].  Stone had boxed Edwards twice in 1917 in Melbourne and Brisbane with mixed results. Edwards was confused by Stone's ability to quickly retreat in his hopping style after he attacked<ref>\"Stone Defeats Edwards\", ''The Age'', Melbourne, Australia, pg. 11, 25 April 1921</ref> \n\nTheir April 1921 title fight was described as an outstanding show of scientific boxing with both boxers well matched.  In fact, both boxers were extremely close in height, reach, and age.  Edwards may have suffered from recent travel.<ref>Crowd of 9000 in \"Australian Boxing Championship\", ''The Observer'', London, Greater England, pg. 19, 24 April 1921</ref>  Recovering from earlier losses, Edwards seemed to look tired and a bit haggard during the bout, and suffered from a cut over his eye received in the fifth, though he fought with vitality and strength. He had the disadvantage of protecting his eye, which reduced his ability to take the offensive, particularly against Stone's signature left.  Stone gained the advantage and was said to have his \"hands, feet, and shoulders all working, while the manner in which he bore into his opponent was both interesting and effective\".  In the seventh, Edwards punished Stones's body against the ropes early in the bout and did better in the infighting, but Stone threw more punches.  As late as the eleventh and thirteenth, Edwards landed a few telling blows, but Stone remained in calculated command, and landed more punches.  Edwards needed stitches to lacerations in both eyelids later in his dressing room, but his right seemed to have taken the most punishment.  The boxers split around 350 English pounds for their efforts.<ref>\"Stone Defeats Edwards\", ''The Age'', Melbourne, Australia, pg. 11, 25 April 1921</ref> The bout was a difficult loss and it would be the last title match of Edwards's career.\n\nOn 12 November 1921, Edwards defeated Jack Suddington in an eleventh round disqualification at Sydney Stadium.  Edwards rained blows on Suddington throughout the bout which left his opponent unperturbed, but in the eleventh with his head down and delivering punches to the body, Suddington was called for a foul from a low blow that ended the bout.  Suddington, though capable of strong blows, fought very few well-rated opponents, and lacked a winning record.<ref>\"Boxing\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', Sydney, Australia, pg. 6, 14 November 1921, pg. 6</ref>\n\nEdwards dreamed of, but never achieved a shot at the lightweight world title, held at the time by American [[Benny Leonard]], who had wrenched it from fellow Welshman [[Freddy Welsh]].  Edwards's slowly fading career, beginning with his vacating the British Empire title, and accelerated by two losses in America, made it evident a shot at the title was unrealistic by 1920.  His painful loss to Harry Stone for the Australian title in 1921 removed chances of a world lightweight title shot. Lacking the British title during the war years, when he was in his prime, may have most clearly denied him a shot at the world featherweight title.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\nOn 18 February 1922, Edwards lost to Stone again in a twenty round points decision at Sydney Stadium. It would be Edwards's last bout, though it was against one of his best opponents.\n\nHe died at 71 in Australia in 1965.  After his death, he was inducted into the Welsh boxer's Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of British featherweight boxing champions]]\n* Jones, Gareth, The Boxers of Wales: Volume Three, Rhondda (St David\u2019s Press, Cardiff, 2012)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{boxrec|id=56317}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edwards, Llew}}\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1965 deaths]]\n[[Category:Welsh male boxers]]\n[[Category:People from Porth]]\n[[Category:Featherweight boxers]]\n[[Category:Lightweight boxers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British boxer}}\n{{for|the Australian politician|Llew Edwards (politician)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox boxer\n|name=Llew Edwards\n|image= LlewEdwardsbox.jpeg\n|caption=Edwards circa 1920\n|imagesize=\n|realname=Hiram Llewellyn Edwards\n|nickname=The Welsh Wizard\n|height= 5\u2032 7\u2033 / 170cm\n|reach=  70\u2033 / 178cm\n|weight=Featherweight, Lightweight\n|nationality= [[United Kingdom|Welsh]]| \n|birth_date={{birth date|1894|10|22|df=y}}\n|birth_place=[[Llynclys]], [[Shropshire]], [[England]]\nmoved to [[Porth]], [[Wales]]\n|death_date=1965\n|death_place=Australia\n|style=Orthadox\n|total=100<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/>\n|wins=83\n|losses=12\n|draws=5\n|no contests=\n|KO=41\n|}}\n\n'''Llewellyn \"Llew\" Edwards''' (22 October 1894 &ndash; 1965) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[boxing|boxer]] who fought professionally between 1913 and 1922.

He soundly defeated Hill again in a fifth round knockout at [[Sydney Stadium]] on July 15, 1916, and again in a sixth round knockout on November 27, 1918 in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |title=Empire Boxing Championship: Decisive Victory of Llew Edwards |work=Birmingham Mail |date=20 December 1915 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000644/19151220/141/0005| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nGeorge Taylor fell to Edwards on 1 January 1916 in a seventh round knockout at Australia's Brisbane Stadium.

Edwards's rise to the Australian lightweight championship looked imminent.\n\n===Taking the Australian lightweight title, Herb McCoy, 1916===\nHe first met Australian lightweight champion Herb McCoy in a non-title 20 round win on points on 27 May 1916 in Sydney Stadium. \n\nEdwards fought for the Australian lightweight title against McCoy on 1 July 1916, but the bout resulted in a draw.  The two met again on 11 November at West Melbourne Stadium with Edwards winning in a twenty round points decision, and taking the lightweight title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Llew Edwards |work=Sheffield Independent |date=8 June 1916 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001464/19160608/069/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=At the Stadium... |work=Western Daily Press |date=14 November 1916 |accessdate=16 January 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000264/19161114/050/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> \n\n[[Image:Dave Smith v Jerry Jerome Sydney Stadium 19 April 1913.jpg|upright=1.35|left|thumb|Sydney Stadium, 1913]]\nHe successfully defended the Australian lightweight title for the last time against McCoy on 10 February 1917 in an eighteenth round knockout at Sydney Stadium, and after relinquishing the title, regained it on 12 January 1920 with a second-round knockout of Frank Brogan in Sydney's Hippodrome.<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/>\n\n====Boxing in the Philippines, 1919====\nEdwards sailed to the Philippines and boxed from 22 February, until 9 August 1919 at the Olympic Stadium in Manilla, and met with considerable success.  On 5 April, he took the Orient Lightweight Title in a ten round points decision against Dencio Cabanella.  Cabanella took the first, fifth, and seventh, but Edwards took the remaining seven rounds against his lighter opponent and \"pounded Cabanella all over the ring in round ten, having him at his mercy when the final bell rang\".  He had previously knocked out Edward Duarte on March 26, in a third round sweep, with vicious one-twos, and two rights to the body that sent his opponent to his knees where he was counted out.<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/>\n\nIn his last fight in the Philippines, on 9 August 1919, Edwards defeated Iron Bux, in a convincing ninth round TKO.  According to the ''Manila Daily Bulletin'',  Edwards handed Bux \"the worst licking that he had ever received. Although the Iron Man was never off his feet, he was battered badly, and suffered eyecuts that rendered him nearly helpless by the time that the fight was halted. Edwards was as effective at long range as he had already proved to be at infighting. He showed a clever defense against Bux's attacks.\" Edwards returned to Australia on August 27.<ref name=\"Boxrec\"/>\n\nFor a period in the Philippines, Edwards acted as a boxing advisor to International Boxing Hall of Famer and world flyweight champion [[Francisco Guilledo]] (1901-1925), a 5' 1\" Philippino, better known under his boxing name Pancho Villa.\u201d  Guilledo was never knocked out, and found fame when he won his world flyweight title in America in 1922.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\n====Boxing decline during brief trip to America====\nOn 26 February 1920, a taller, younger, and stronger Richie Mitchell knocked down Edwards in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the sixth and his handlers threw in the towel before the bell for the seventh. In all, Mitchell floored him for a nine count in the second and sixth, and for a count of two in the third.  Though showing his best efforts in the fourth, Edwards could do no damage.<ref>\"Ritchie Mitchell Lands Knockout\", ''The Capital Times'', pg. 20, 27 February 1920</ref> \n\n=====Brief return to Britain to box=====\nReturning briefly to Britain on 28 May 1920, Edwards faced Johnny Regan at Carbrook, Yorkshire, reversing his loss against Mitchell and winning in the third of twenty rounds.  Regrettably for his fans, who had dwindled in his absence during the war, it would be his last British bout.  Returning to America on September 3, 1920, Edwards won a ten round newspaper decision against Johnny Noye at Minneapolis's Nicolete Park.  Edwards won with only a slight lead over Noye, a boxer he would have beaten convincingly five years earlier.<ref>\"Lllew Edwards Wallops Noye\", ''Los Angeles Times'', Los Angeles, California, pg. 9, 5 September 1920</ref>\n\nEdwards faced Jack Lawler on 30 July 1920, in Milwaukee, winning in a ten round newspaper decision.  In the pre-flight publicity, Edwards was praised for his determination, and for being \"of the sort who keeps tearing in.  Despite the fact that he was dropped several times by Ritchie Mitchell in their previous bout, Llew arose each time and with a bull-like rush started after the Milwaukee blonde(Mitchell).  He is a game ringster.\"  Lawler was described as a mauler, but he showed little of it against Edwards.<ref>\"Star Boxing Bell Offered\", ''The Journal Times'', Racine, Wisconsin, pg. 8, 30 July 1920</ref>  The bout was described as a slow and uninteresting affair, but after a string of recent fights, both boxers may have been feeling each other out and wary of the other's skills.  Lawler was said to stall until the ninth and tenth rounds.  In a close bout, Edwards was given the third, fourth, and seventh, with Lawler the fifth and ninth with the rest even.  Edwards took the lead throughout the bout, and though he had many of his punches blocked, he landed enough to take the bout.<ref>\"Llew Edwards Trims Lawler\", ''The Capital Times\", Madison, Wisconsin, pg. 8, 31 July 1920</ref>\n\nEdwards remained boxing in the United States through late 1920, when he lost to Clonie Tait at Nicolete Park on 12 November 1920 in a second round TKO. He was down eleven times before his manager threw in the towel.  It appeared clear the Welsh boxer was outclassed, tiring, and facing a painful decline in his boxing career by the end of his American tour.<ref>\"Ritchie Mitchell Lands Knockout\", ''The Capital Times'', pg. 20, 27 February 1920</ref>\n\nEdwards career was now clearly in decline but he was in need of cash and needed more fights.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\n===Return to Australia and career decline===\nOn his return to Australia, he defeated French-born Eugene Volaire in a twenty round points decision in Brisbane on 5 March 1921.  On 4 April 1921, in a non-title bout, Edwards defeated Sid Godfrey, a highly rated future Australian lightweight title holder five years younger, in an important twenty round points decision at Sydney Stadium.  The ''Sydney Daily Telegraph'' called the match, \"a contest full of fight with both men displaying a scientific knowledge above the ordinary, speed, punching power and tenacity.\"   Even near the end of his career Edwards could fight with style, but his decline would seem evident against more skilled American competitors on the rise like Harry Stone who had learned the game from tougher New York competitors.  Ironically, the following month Godfrey would take the Australian lightweight title from Stone, a boxer with whom Edwards would never defeat again.<ref>\"Leicester vs. Gloucester\", ''The Times'', London, England, 4 April 1921</ref>\n\n===Final loss of the Australian lightweight title to Harry Stone, 1921===\n[[File:Harry Stone LCCN2014696871 (cropped) 2.jpg|upright=.99|right|thumb|Exceptional New York Lightweight, Harry Stone]]\nEdwards mounted a last defense of the Australian lightweight title before an impressive crowd of 9000 on 23 April 1921 in a twenty round bout in Melbourne, Australia, against frequent but dangerous rival New York Jewish boxer [[Harry Stone (boxer)|Harry Stone]].  Stone had boxed Edwards twice in 1917 in Melbourne and Brisbane with mixed results. Edwards was confused by Stone's ability to quickly retreat in his hopping style after he attacked<ref>\"Stone Defeats Edwards\", ''The Age'', Melbourne, Australia, pg. 11, 25 April 1921</ref> \n\nTheir April 1921 title fight was described as an outstanding show of scientific boxing with both boxers well matched.  In fact, both boxers were extremely close in height, reach, and age.  Edwards may have suffered from recent travel.<ref>Crowd of 9000 in \"Australian Boxing Championship\", ''The Observer'', London, Greater England, pg. 19, 24 April 1921</ref>  Recovering from earlier losses, Edwards seemed to look tired and a bit haggard during the bout, and suffered from a cut over his eye received in the fifth, though he fought with vitality and strength. He had the disadvantage of protecting his eye, which reduced his ability to take the offensive, particularly against Stone's signature left.  Stone gained the advantage and was said to have his \"hands, feet, and shoulders all working, while the manner in which he bore into his opponent was both interesting and effective\".  In the seventh, Edwards punished Stones's body against the ropes early in the bout and did better in the infighting, but Stone threw more punches.  As late as the eleventh and thirteenth, Edwards landed a few telling blows, but Stone remained in calculated command, and landed more punches.  Edwards needed stitches to lacerations in both eyelids later in his dressing room, but his right seemed to have taken the most punishment.  The boxers split around 350 English pounds for their efforts.<ref>\"Stone Defeats Edwards\", ''The Age'', Melbourne, Australia, pg. 11, 25 April 1921</ref> The bout was a difficult loss and it would be the last title match of Edwards's career.\n\nOn 12 November 1921, Edwards defeated Jack Suddington in an eleventh round disqualification at Sydney Stadium.  Edwards rained blows on Suddington throughout the bout which left his opponent unperturbed, but in the eleventh with his head down and delivering punches to the body, Suddington was called for a foul from a low blow that ended the bout.  Suddington, though capable of strong blows, fought very few well-rated opponents, and lacked a winning record.<ref>\"Boxing\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', Sydney, Australia, pg. 6, 14 November 1921, pg. 6</ref>\n\nEdwards dreamed of, but never achieved a shot at the lightweight world title, held at the time by American [[Benny Leonard]], who had wrenched it from fellow Welshman [[Freddy Welsh]].  Edwards's slowly fading career, beginning with his vacating the British Empire title, and accelerated by two losses in America, made it evident a shot at the title was unrealistic by 1920.  His painful loss to Harry Stone for the Australian title in 1921 removed chances of a world lightweight title shot. Lacking the British title during the war years, when he was in his prime, may have most clearly denied him a shot at the world featherweight title.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\nOn 18 February 1922, Edwards lost to Stone again in a twenty round points decision at Sydney Stadium. It would be Edwards's last bout, though it was against one of his best opponents.\n\nHe died at 71 in Australia in 1965.  After his death, he was inducted into the Welsh boxer's Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"Welsh Boxers\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of British featherweight boxing champions]]\n* Jones, Gareth, The Boxers of Wales: Volume Three, Rhondda (St David\u2019s Press, Cardiff, 2012)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{boxrec|id=56317}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edwards, Llew}}\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1965 deaths]]\n[[Category:Welsh male boxers]]\n[[Category:People from Porth]]\n[[Category:Featherweight boxers]]\n[[Category:Lightweight boxers]]\n", "name_user": "Emperork", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBoxing in the Philippines, 1919:corrected to \"Filipino\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llew_Edwards"}

Dan Dare has been described as \"[[Biggles]] in Space\" and as the British equivalent of [[Buck Rogers]]. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated [[comic-strip]] artwork by Hampson and other artists, including [[Harold Johns (artist)|Harold Johns]], [[Don Harley]], [[Bruce Cornwell]], [[Greta Tomlinson]], [[Frank Bellamy]] and [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]].\n\n''Dan Dare'' returned in new strips in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' in 1977 until 1979 and in the relaunched ''Eagle'' in 1982 until 1994. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by [[Virgin Comics]] in 2007 and 2008.  It was written by [[Garth Ennis]] and illustrated by [[Gary Erskine]] and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in ''[[Spaceship Away]]'', a mail-order magazine created by Rod Barzilay. Its mission statement is to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original ''Eagle'' left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson's death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the Fifties stories.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===''Eagle''===\n<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Dan Dare - Operation Moss comic panel.png|thumb|A Frank Hampson & Don Harley page from the 1959 ''Eagle Annual No. 8'': Dan Dare in ''Operation Moss'']] -->\nDan Dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine, ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', on 14 April 1950. There were two large colour pages of his story per issue. The artwork was of a high quality, the product of artists in a studio called the Old Bakehouse in Churchtown, [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]]. The Eagle's founder, the Rev [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|John Marcus Harston Morris]], was vicar of the Southport church of St James at the time. It had scale models of [[spaceships]], and [[model (art)|models]] in costume as reference for the artists. Occasionally, ''Eagle'' incorporated \"[[centrefold]]s\" of the fictional spaceships, such as Dan's ship the ''Anastasia'', reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even ''Eagle'' itself.  The storylines were long and complex, sometimes lasting more than a year. Later, artwork was produced at a studio in Hampson's house in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], where his production line techniques were continued.\n\nAttention was paid to scientific plausibility, the promising young writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (later a [[science fiction]] luminary)<ref name=\"Future Perfect\">{{Citation | last = Gorton | first = Mark | title = Future Perfect | url = http://thelancashiremagazine.co.uk/index.php/history/50-futureperfect | publisher = thelancashiremagazine.co.uk | date = 18 February 2010 | accessdate = 23 June 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516093718/http://thelancashiremagazine.co.uk/index.php/history/50-futureperfect |archivedate=16 May 2010}}</ref> acting as science and plot adviser for the first six months of strips. The stories were set mostly on planets of the [[Solar System]] presumed to have [[extraterrestrial life]] and alien inhabitants, common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless. The first story begins with Dan Dare as pilot of the first successful flight to [[Venus]].\n\nHampson's working habits twice caused him to suffer serious breakdowns in health, leaving his assistants to continue the series. The first occurred after two episodes of \"Marooned on Mercury\" (1952), which was taken over by Harold Johns, from scripts by [[Samaritans]] founder and clergyman Rev. [[Chad Varah]], who had known Marcus Morris in Southport. Hampson returned to start the following story, \"Operation Saturn\" (1953), but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks. Principal art was taken over by new chief assistant [[Don Harley]], who completed the story and its successor, \"Prisoners of Space\" (the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio, finishes being provided by [[Desmond Walduck]].\n\nHampson returned full-time in 1955, starting \"The Man from Nowhere\" trilogy, which took Dan and his companions outside the Solar System for the first time.\n\nThe quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties ''Eagle'''s new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to [[Frank Bellamy]], whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson's, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell.\n\n====Characters====\nDan Dare was surrounded by a varying cast, initially:\n* '''Dan Dare''' (full name [[Colonel]] Daniel McGregor Dare) was chief pilot of the Interplanet Space Fleet. He was born in [[Manchester]], England, in 1967 and educated at [[Rossall School]].<ref>http://www.dandare.org.uk/DanDareWho1.htm</ref> Although not a super-hero, he sometimes pulled off exceptional piloting and often proved extraordinarily lucky. He excelled at [[jujutsu]], but he most often found non-violent solutions to predicaments. He was bound by a sense of honour, never lied, and would rather die than break his word.\n:His lean-faced character was recognisable by the outer tips of his [[eyebrows]], which were wavy. His uniform looked like a typical [[British Army]] type (Frank Hampson used his own World War II army uniform as a model), though a lighter green. In place of British rank insignia it had coloured stripes and circles on the shoulderboards. His cap badge was a vertical, antique rocketship in a circle with one five-pointed star on either side. Initially, Dare had been intended to be portrayed as a [[chaplain]].\n* '''Digby''' (Albert Fitzwilliam Digby) was Dan's [[Wigan]]-born [[Batman (army)|batman]]. Rotund and sometimes bumbling, he provided comic relief. He was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from Dan to appear in every story. His favourite recreation was sleeping and he was fond of traditional English food.  His nearest relative was his Aunt Anastasia, after whom Dan named his spaceship.\n* '''Sir Hubert Guest''', Controller of the Space Fleet, sent Dan on missions, and occasionally joined him. He was a veteran pilot, having been on the first mission to the Moon and led the first mission to Mars. He was based on Hampson's father.\n* '''Professor Peabody''' (Prof. Jocelyn Mabel Peabody), the only major female, was the brains behind many of the team's most inventive plans.\n* '''Hank Hogan''' and '''Pierre Lafayette''', stereotypically [[United States|American]] and [[France|French]], were two of the Fleet's best pilots and an inseparable double-act. Pierre was primarily a pilot, Hank more a mechanic.\n* '''Sondar''' was a [[Treens|Treen]], a reptilian inhabitant of northern [[Venus]]. Originally a servant of [[the Mekon]], he reformed after Dan spared his life during a traumatic episode that also caused his first experience of strong emotion, which the Treens suppressed.  He became governor of northern Venus when the planet was placed under [[United Nations|UN]] rule at the end of the first story, but nevertheless joined Dan on later adventures. He was also a talented spacecraft designer, and designed Dan's personal spaceship.\n* '''[[The Mekon]]''', super-intelligent ruler of the [[Treens]], was Dan's archenemy. He escaped at the end of each story to return with an even more inventive scheme for the conquest of Earth.\n* '''Christopher 'Flamer' Spry''', freckle-faced student at 'Astral' space academy, who accompanies Dan Dare on many later missions. Flamer was based on Hampson's son, Peter Hampson.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7376571.stm Dan Dare 'inspired UK innovation'] ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>\n* '''Lex O'Malley''', bearded [[Irish people|Irish]] [[submarine]] commander, who accompanies Dan Dare on later missions.\n\nWith the exception of Digby, all the supporting cast were dropped after 1961, although Guest, O'Malley, Hogan and Sondar made occasional reappearances.  In 1963, Keith Watson and writer David Motton were allowed to introduce a new supporting cast, who remained with the series throughout the rest of its run.\n\n*'''Colonel Wilf Banger''', handlebar moustache, pilot and designer, an impulsive and volatile character. Banger designed and built the Tempus Frangit.\n*'''Technician Nutter Cobb''', red-haired, broken-nosed. Banger's assistant, a Digby to his Dare.\n*'''Major Shillitoe Spence''', balding, pencil moustache. A prim, fussy administrator.\n*'''Xel''',  first encountered in ''Operation Time Trap'' in 1963. Xel is another enemy in the mould of the Mekon.  Having stowed away with Dare at the end of his first appearance, in the next story Xel allies with the Mekon but the two fall out.  Xel would make regular appearances through the 60s before being finally captured.\n\n====Vehicles====\n[[Spacecraft]] of various designs were presented as the product of inhabitants of various planets. The vehicle most identified with Dan was the winged ''Anastasia''. Designed by Sondar, it employed both Venusian and Earth space drives. Later, an alien ship was adopted and renamed the ''Zyl-bat''. There was also an experimental time-travelling ship called ''Tempus Frangit'' ([[Latin]]: ''it breaks time'' or ''time breaks'').\n\nThere were land and air vehicles \u2013 in the first stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines were based on the design of [[helicopter]]s of the mid-twentieth century.  Also of note was Lex O'Malley's ship, the ''Poseidon'', a versatile craft that could operate as a [[jetfoil]] as well as a submarine.\n\n[[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] used overhead [[monorail]]s and helibuses in early stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with [[gyroscopes]] and single wheels.\n\nVenusian vehicles were depicted as being technologically more advanced than those of Earth. South of the Flamebelt the Therons had applied their technology to peaceful agricultural purposes including dedicated agricultural land and flying machines. North of the Flamebelt the Treens perfected low friction/low energy consumption means of transport including vacuum tube transport (Electrosenders) for long distance travel.\n\n====Spaceports====\nThere is evidence that the Spacefleet spaceport on Earth is west of [[Formby]] in [[Lancashire]] on a semicircle of land built into the [[Irish Sea]] by [[landfill]].\n\n====Spacesuits====\nSpacefleet spacesuits had a [[corselet plate]] like on [[Siebe Gorman]] [[standard diving suit]]s. Their suit had no [[life-support]] backpack; the life-support gear was between two layers of the helmet.\n\nAll or most Dan Dare comic pictures were drawn from models or posed humans. As a result, the Spacefleet [[spacesuit]]s in space hang in folds like the [[boilersuit]] in which the models posed and show no sign of gas pressure. After the first Venus war, Spacefleet spacesuits had propulsor backpacks copied from a Treen or [[Therons|Theron]] design.\n\nSome other spacesuits such as Blasco's have life-support backpacks.\n\n====The 1960s====\nIn 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]], [[Gerald Palmer (comics)|Gerald Palmer]], with [[Bruce Cornwell]], and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when ''Eagle'' merged with ''[[Lion (comic)|Lion]]''. For a while the reprints continued in black and white in ''Lion''.\n\n===''2000 AD''===\nIn 1977, Dan Dare appeared again in the first issue of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' (26 February 1977). The first instalment, scripted by Ken Armstrong and [[Pat Mills]], had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world. The Mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different, as was the tone of the strip (heavily influenced by the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement, as was much of ''2000 AD'') and the personality of the title character. Written by [[Kelvin Gosnell]] and then Steve Moore, the strip was initially illustrated by [[Massimo Bellardinelli]], whose Dare owed nothing to the original apart from the wavy eyebrows. After 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style, written by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and Jack Adrian (Chris Lowder) and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]]. Dare was now launched on a deep space mission, much in the style of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' but with technology designs very much influenced by ''[[Star Wars]]''. In a series of episodic adventures, Dare encountered various threats, including an extended multi-episode adventure uniting slave races in opposition to the \"Star Slayers\" \u2013 the oppressive race controlling that region. The overall mission had a surprisingly downbeat ending, leaving a space-suited Dare the only survivor, adrift in space on wreckage.\n\nThe strip was rested for 14 issues, returning early in 1979 in ''2000 AD'''s 100th issue. The amnesiac Dare is rescued from space by the Mekon and indoctrinated into the Mekon's army before eventually recovering his memory. Now penned by [[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]] but still drawn by Dave Gibbons, this re-imagining of Dare casts him almost as a superhero with a colourful tight-fitting uniform provided by the Mekon. Dare escapes to a planet that is home to an amphibian-like race, which claims he is their Chosen One. There he receives a semi-mystical glove that can shoot energy beams but is unable to prevent the Mekon from acquiring the mystical Crystal of Life. On his return to Earth, he and his Treen companion Sondar find themselves branded traitors and found guilty of helping the Mekon to steal the Crystal. This story arc concluded with the pair escaping the Earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the Mekon and recovering the Crystal, establishing the format for the next story arc. Despite promises that Dare and Sondar would be back, the ''2000 AD'' Dan Dare strip \"Attack on Eternium\" ended here in prog 126 (18 August 1979).\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate their 20th anniversary, ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' published two issues with additional free comics, the first a reprint of the first issue of ''2000 AD'', which starred Dan Dare. The second free comic was a speculative issue called ''3000 AD'' which contained strips partially based on the first issue of ''2000 AD''. One strip was entitled \"The Return of Dan Dare\", which also featured the return of the Mekon.\n\n===The new ''Eagle''===\nIn 1982 ''Eagle'' was re-launched, with ''Dan Dare'' again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-great-grandson of the original hero\u2014the only surviving character from the original strip being the Mekon. The initial artist was [[Gerry Embleton]], who drew Dan to resemble the original exactly, but he was quickly replaced by [[Ian Kennedy (comic artist)|Ian Kennedy]], who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair.\n\nThe opening ''Dan Dare'' story was an epic, lasting 18 months, written by [[Pat Mills]] and [[John Wagner]]. It opened with a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the unseen final defeat of the Mekon by the original Dan, after which he was sealed inside an artificial [[asteroid]] and exiled into space. Centuries later he was accidentally freed and returned to conquer Earth. A few years later the descendant of his sworn enemy returned from space to find Earth under Treen rule and set out to free the planet. His new cast included Lt Helen Scott, leader of the Earth Resistance, and Valdon, a renegade Treen similar to the earlier Sondar. One controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which [[retcon]]ned the original Dan to be a veteran of the Second World War and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original ''Eagle'' took place\u2014an attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life.\n\nAfter this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went, including Professor Pinkerton, a female scientist similar to Professor Peabody, and a new Digby (again, a descendant of the original). The Mekon was generally the foe in alternate stories.\n\nIn 1987 the strip became more like a [[space opera]], with increasing violence. Now drawn by John Gillatt, Dan took on a tough-guy look. He led space commandos and packed a hi-tech gun reminiscent of that carried by [[Judge Dredd]].\n\nThe original strip, featuring the original characters of the 1950s ''Eagle'', was revived in 1989, with artist [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]]  providing the artwork for the initial run of stories. Watson had been part of the Dan Dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was sole artist on ''Dan Dare'' from 1962 to 1967. The new ''Eagle'' ended in 1994.\n\n===''Revolver''===\nIn 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialised in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Monday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]]). Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon. The last episode appeared in ''[[Crisis (Fleetway)|Crisis]]'', following ''Revolver'''s cancellation.\n\n===''The Planet''===\nIn 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, \"Remembrance\", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.\n\n===Virgin Comics===\nIn 2007\u20132008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]].<ref>[http://www.2000ad.nu/spacefleet/virgin/ Gary Erskine's page on ''Dan Dare'']</ref>  Virgin's founder and chairman [[Richard Branson]] is a fan of the character.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970907.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 Virgin takes up 'Dare'], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], August 26, 2007</ref> The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result, with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.\n\n===''Spaceship Away''===\nLaunched in October 2003, [http://www.spaceshipaway.org.uk Spaceship Away] magazine was originally created in order to get \"The Phoenix Mission\" (a 1950s style story by Rod Barzilay with art by Keith Watson and Don Harley) into publication, with the agreement of the Dan Dare Corporation. Response was good enough to warrant the magazine's continuation following that strip's conclusion, initially with \"Green Nemesis\" (again by Barzilay and Don Harley, with later chapters drawn by David Pugh and Tim Booth. Other stories have since followed.\n\nDespite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own Web site or in a select few comic shops), ''Spaceship Away'' continues to appear three times a year.\n\n===Titan Comics===\nIn 2017\u201318 a four-issue mini-series by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Alberto Foche]] was published  by [[Titan Comics]].<ref>\"Dare to be Different\" by Stephen Jewell, ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #390, 2017</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Radio===\n\n====Radio Luxembourg serial====\n[[Image:dandare.jpg|thumb|This ad for the Dan Dare ''pilot of the future'' serial appeared in the '''[[Radio Luxembourg (English)|208]]''' magazine in March 1952]]\n''The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future'' aired five times a week on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for five years from 2 July 1951.

The dialogue was straight from wartime upper class RAF officers' slang.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future (TV Series)|Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'' became a [[3D computer graphics|computer-generated]] TV series produced first by [[Netter Digital]] then by [[Foundation Imaging]], running to twenty-six 22-minute episodes. The series drew on several comic book incarnations. It started on [[Nicktoons UK]] on 5 November 2005 at 6.30&nbsp;pm. Two abortive attempts had been made to make a live-action series, in 1981 and 1991. [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]] and [[Robert Bathurst]] were reportedly lined up to play Dare respectively. In 1991 a short pilot starring Bathurst as Dare, and [[Geoffrey Hughes]] as Digby was made.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Dare Remembered |author=John Freeman |work=Down The Tubes |url=http://www.downthetubes.net/features/comics_characters/dan_dare/dan_dare.html |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044443/http://www.downthetubes.net/features/comics_characters/dan_dare/dan_dare.html |archivedate=May 2, 2012 }}</ref> Parts of it were broadcast in an ITV documentary, ''Future Perfect''.\n\n===Film===\nIn 2010, [[Variety.com|Variety]] announced that [[Warner Bros.]] was planning to produce a Dan Dare movie starring [[Sam Worthington]] in the title role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Warner Bros. takes on space 'Dare'|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/markets-festivals/warner-bros-takes-on-space-dare-1118022089/|website=Variety.com|accessdate=12 May 2016|date=2010-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Computer games===\nDuring the 1980s Dan Dare starred in three computer games for the [[Commodore 64]]/128, [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari]] computers. The first was a different game on each system; the second and third were shoot'em-ups. All three were based on the 1950s strip rather than the contemporary comics.\n\n*''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'' (1986, Electronic Arts, re-released by Ricochet)\n*''Dan Dare II: The Mekon's Revenge'' (1988, Virgin Games, re-released by Ricochet)\n*''Dan Dare III: The Escape'' (1990, Virgin Games)\n\n===Music===\n[[Pink Floyd]] founder [[Syd Barrett]] wrote Dan Dare into his song \"Astronomy Domine\", from the band's debut album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', with the line \"Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?\"\n\n[[David Bowie]]'s song \"D.J.\" contains the somewhat obscure lyric: \"I feel like Dan Dare lies down\"\n\nSir [[Elton John]] recorded \"Dan Dare (Pilot Of The Future)\" for his 1975 album ''Rock Of The Westies''.\n\nBritish punk rock group The Mekons included a song \"Dan Dare\" on their album ''The Quality of Mercy is not Strnen''.\n \nThe album [[Below the Waste]] by the [[Art of Noise]] opened with the song \"Dan Dare\"\n\nThe relaunch of the [[Eagle Magazine]] in 1982 saw a free single giveaway of a track called ''Dan Dare'' by the group Loose Talk.\n\n==Characters inspired by Dan Dare==\nCharacters inspired by or based on Dan Dare have appeared throughout British popular culture. One example is Wing Commander Leyton in ''British Summertime'' by [[Paul Cornell]], which juxtaposes the utopian future portrayed in the original comics with the Britain of today.\n\nIn the 1980s, ''[[Private Eye]]'' published ''Dan Dire, Pilot of Future?''. Dire was based on politician [[Neil Kinnock]], the question being whether he'd ever become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Dire's enemy was the Maggon, a combination of [[the Mekon]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>'Sufferin' Satellites, Dan Dare is Back!', [[the Independent]], 14 April 1990</ref>\n\nRadio DJ and Comedian [[Kenny Everett]]'s character Captain Kremmen was inspired by Dan Dare.\n\nA porcine pastiche, ''[[Ham Dare: Pig of the Future]]'', written by [[Lew Stringer]] and with art by [[Malcolm Douglas (illustrator)|Malcolm Douglas]], appeared in ''[[Oink! (comic)|Oink!]]'' comic.<ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/ham-dare/4005-87799/ Comic Vine]</ref>\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] created a Dan Dare-esque character in their [[Captain Britain]] line in the 1980s. The character was Roy Risk, one of the [[United Kingdom|British]] heroes killed by [[Fury (Marvel comics)|The Fury]].\n\nIn [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' series, the character [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]]'s secret identity is astronomer Isabel 'Izzy' Dare whose dying elderly grandfather alludes to Izzy as inheriting a destiny from him.  He hand her a business card that expresses a deep friendship with [[Captain America]].  The card reveals the grandfather's name as Dan.  In the trade hardcover for Avengers, Izzy's last name is changed to Kane, meaning her grandfather is Marvel's Captain Terror.\n\nIn his Afterword to ''[[Ministry of Space]]'', [[Warren Ellis]] lists Dan Dare as one of the inspirations for the story, in which Britain forges an ambitious space programme in the decades following World War II. Sir John Dashwood, the central character of ''Ministry of Space'', is a cynical version of Dan Dare himself.<ref>Ellis, W: \"Ministry Of Space\", 'The Afterword'. Titan Books, 2005</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Jack Harkness]], the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' character, has several similarities to Dan Dare. The script for the episode \"[[The Empty Child]]\" in which Captain Jack makes his first appearance describes him as having \"the jawline of Dan Dare, the smile of a bastard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Doctor Who: The Shooting Scripts\n  | publisher = [[BBC Books]]\n  | year = 2005\n  | location =\n  | page = 323\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-563-48641-1}}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\nMost of the 1950s and 1960s strips were reprinted by [[Hawk Books]] between 1987 and 1995.\n# ''Pilot of the Future''\n# ''[[The Red Moon Mystery]]'' and ''[[Marooned on Mercury]]''\n# ''[[Operation Saturn (Dan Dare)|Operation Saturn]]''\n# ''[[Prisoners of Space]]''\n# ''[[The Man from Nowhere (comics)|The Man from Nowhere]]''\n# ''[[Rogue Planet (Dan Dare)|Rogue Planet]]''\n# ''Reign of the Robots'' and ''The Ship That Lived''\n# ''The Phantom Fleet''\n# ''Terra Nova'' trilogy\n# ''Project Nimbus''\n# ''Solid Space Mystery''\n# ''The Final Volume''\n\nStories left out were :\n* ''Operation Earthsavers'' (v13, 10\u201323)\n* ''The Evil One'' (v13, 24\u201332)\n* ''Operation Fireball'' (v13, 33\u201342)\n* ''The Web of Fear'' (v13, 43\u201352)\n* ''Operation Dark Star'' (v14, 1\u20139)\n* ''Operation Time Trap'' (v14, 10\u201338)\n* ''The Wandering World'' (v14, 39 \u2013 v15, 13)\n* ''The Big City Caper'' (v15, 14\u201322)\n* ''The Singing Scourge'' (v16, 30 \u2013 v17, 6)\n* ''Give Me The Moon'' (v17, 7\u201326)\n\nIn 2004, [[Titan Books]] began collecting the series from the beginning of the Hampson run in dust-jacketed hardback editions.

Dan Dare has been described as \"[[Biggles]] in Space\" and as the British equivalent of [[Buck Rogers]]. Dan Dare was distinguished by its long, complex storylines, snappy dialogue and meticulously illustrated [[comic-strip]] artwork by Hampson and other artists, including [[Harold Johns (artist)|Harold Johns]], [[Don Harley]], [[Bruce Cornwell]], [[Greta Tomlinson]], [[Frank Bellamy]] and [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]].\n\n''Dan Dare'' returned in new strips in ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' in 1977 until 1979 and in the relaunched ''Eagle'' in 1982 until 1994. The most recent mainstream story was a Dan Dare mini-series published by [[Virgin Comics]] in 2007 and 2008.  It was written by [[Garth Ennis]] and illustrated by [[Gary Erskine]] and is a completely new and somewhat darker interpretation of Dan Dare. Since October 2003, however, Dare's adventures have also continued in ''[[Spaceship Away]]'', a mail-order magazine created by Rod Barzilay. Its mission statement is to continue the original Dare's adventures where the original ''Eagle'' left off, in a style as close to that of the classic strip as possible. To that end, Barzilay originally hired former Eagle artist Keith Watson, and following Watson's death Don Harley, both of whom had drawn Dare in the 1960s, to work on the strips which are written very much in the style of the Fifties stories.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===''Eagle''===\n<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Dan Dare - Operation Moss comic panel.png|thumb|A Frank Hampson & Don Harley page from the 1959 ''Eagle Annual No. 8'': Dan Dare in ''Operation Moss'']] -->\nDan Dare appeared on the cover of the first issue of the weekly comic strip magazine, ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', on 14 April 1950. There were two large colour pages of his story per issue. The artwork was of a high quality, the product of artists in a studio called the Old Bakehouse in Churchtown, [[Southport]], [[Lancashire]]. The Eagle's founder, the Rev [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|John Marcus Harston Morris]], was vicar of the Southport church of St James at the time. It had scale models of [[spaceships]], and [[model (art)|models]] in costume as reference for the artists. Occasionally, ''Eagle'' incorporated \"[[centrefold]]s\" of the fictional spaceships, such as Dan's ship the ''Anastasia'', reminiscent of cutaway drawings of aircraft in aviation magazines or even ''Eagle'' itself.  The storylines were long and complex, sometimes lasting more than a year. Later, artwork was produced at a studio in Hampson's house in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], where his production line techniques were continued.\n\nAttention was paid to scientific plausibility, the promising young writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (later a [[science fiction]] luminary)<ref name=\"Future Perfect\">{{Citation | last = Gorton | first = Mark | title = Future Perfect | url = http://thelancashiremagazine.co.uk/index.php/history/50-futureperfect | publisher = thelancashiremagazine.co.uk | date = 18 February 2010 | accessdate = 23 June 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516093718/http://thelancashiremagazine.co.uk/index.php/history/50-futureperfect |archivedate=16 May 2010}}</ref> acting as science and plot adviser for the first six months of strips. The stories were set mostly on planets of the [[Solar System]] presumed to have [[extraterrestrial life]] and alien inhabitants, common in science fiction before space probes of the 1960s proved the most likely worlds were lifeless. The first story begins with Dan Dare as pilot of the first successful flight to [[Venus]].\n\nHampson's working habits twice caused him to suffer serious breakdowns in health, leaving his assistants to continue the series. The first occurred after two episodes of \"Marooned on Mercury\" (1952), which was taken over by Harold Johns, from scripts by [[Samaritans]] founder and clergyman Rev. [[Chad Varah]], who had known Marcus Morris in Southport. Hampson returned to start the following story, \"Operation Saturn\" (1953), but suffered a relapse after 20 weeks. Principal art was taken over by new chief assistant [[Don Harley]], who completed the story and its successor, \"Prisoners of Space\" (the only series to feature extensive work by an artist outside the studio, finishes being provided by [[Desmond Walduck]].\n\nHampson returned full-time in 1955, starting \"The Man from Nowhere\" trilogy, which took Dan and his companions outside the Solar System for the first time.\n\nThe quality of the strip and its popularity remained high throughout the 1950s. In the late fifties ''Eagle'''s new owners objected to the cost of the studio and the complexity of the stories. The conflict caused Hampson to leave the strip in 1959, in the middle of a long plot that saw Dan searching an alien planet for his long-lost father. Production fell to [[Frank Bellamy]], whose modern three-dimensional style contrasted with Hampson's, despite efforts to smooth the transition by alternating the two pages of the weekly strip between Bellamy and the team of Don Harley and Keith Watson, and freelance artist Bruce Cornwell.\n\n====Characters====\nDan Dare was surrounded by a varying cast, initially:\n* '''Dan Dare''' (full name [[Colonel]] Daniel McGregor Dare) was chief pilot of the Interplanet Space Fleet. He was born in [[Manchester]], England, in 1967 and educated at [[Rossall School]].<ref>http://www.dandare.org.uk/DanDareWho1.htm</ref> Although not a super-hero, he sometimes pulled off exceptional piloting and often proved extraordinarily lucky. He excelled at [[jujutsu]], but he most often found non-violent solutions to predicaments. He was bound by a sense of honour, never lied, and would rather die than break his word.\n:His lean-faced character was recognisable by the outer tips of his [[eyebrows]], which were wavy. His uniform looked like a typical [[British Army]] type (Frank Hampson used his own World War II army uniform as a model), though a lighter green. In place of British rank insignia it had coloured stripes and circles on the shoulderboards. His cap badge was a vertical, antique rocketship in a circle with one five-pointed star on either side. Initially, Dare had been intended to be portrayed as a [[chaplain]].\n* '''Digby''' (Albert Fitzwilliam Digby) was Dan's [[Wigan]]-born [[Batman (army)|batman]]. Rotund and sometimes bumbling, he provided comic relief. He was fiercely loyal and the only character apart from Dan to appear in every story. His favourite recreation was sleeping and he was fond of traditional English food.  His nearest relative was his Aunt Anastasia, after whom Dan named his spaceship.\n* '''Sir Hubert Guest''', Controller of the Space Fleet, sent Dan on missions, and occasionally joined him. He was a veteran pilot, having been on the first mission to the Moon and led the first mission to Mars. He was based on Hampson's father.\n* '''Professor Peabody''' (Prof. Jocelyn Mabel Peabody), the only major female, was the brains behind many of the team's most inventive plans.\n* '''Hank Hogan''' and '''Pierre Lafayette''', stereotypically [[United States|American]] and [[France|French]], were two of the Fleet's best pilots and an inseparable double-act. Pierre was primarily a pilot, Hank more a mechanic.\n* '''Sondar''' was a [[Treens|Treen]], a reptilian inhabitant of northern [[Venus]]. Originally a servant of [[the Mekon]], he reformed after Dan spared his life during a traumatic episode that also caused his first experience of strong emotion, which the Treens suppressed.  He became governor of northern Venus when the planet was placed under [[United Nations|UN]] rule at the end of the first story, but nevertheless joined Dan on later adventures. He was also a talented spacecraft designer, and designed Dan's personal spaceship.\n* '''[[The Mekon]]''', super-intelligent ruler of the [[Treens]], was Dan's archenemy. He escaped at the end of each story to return with an even more inventive scheme for the conquest of Earth.\n* '''Christopher 'Flamer' Spry''', freckle-faced student at 'Astral' space academy, who accompanies Dan Dare on many later missions. Flamer was based on Hampson's son, Peter Hampson.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7376571.stm Dan Dare 'inspired UK innovation'] ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>\n* '''Lex O'Malley''', bearded [[Irish people|Irish]] [[submarine]] commander, who accompanies Dan Dare on later missions.\n\nWith the exception of Digby, all the supporting cast were dropped after 1961, although Guest, O'Malley, Hogan and Sondar made occasional reappearances.  In 1963, Keith Watson and writer David Motton were allowed to introduce a new supporting cast, who remained with the series throughout the rest of its run.\n\n*'''Colonel Wilf Banger''', handlebar moustache, pilot and designer, an impulsive and volatile character. Banger designed and built the Tempus Frangit.\n*'''Technician Nutter Cobb''', red-haired, broken-nosed. Banger's assistant, a Digby to his Dare.\n*'''Major Shillitoe Spence''', balding, pencil moustache. A prim, fussy administrator.\n*'''Xel''',  first encountered in ''Operation Time Trap'' in 1963. Xel is another enemy in the mould of the Mekon.  Having stowed away with Dare at the end of his first appearance, in the next story Xel allies with the Mekon but the two fall out.  Xel would make regular appearances through the 60s before being finally captured.\n\n====Vehicles====\n[[Spacecraft]] of various designs were presented as the product of inhabitants of various planets. The vehicle most identified with Dan was the winged ''Anastasia''. Designed by Sondar, it employed both Venusian and Earth space drives. Later, an alien ship was adopted and renamed the ''Zyl-bat''. There was also an experimental time-travelling ship called ''Tempus Frangit'' ([[Latin]]: ''it breaks time'' or ''time breaks'').\n\nThere were land and air vehicles \u2013 in the first stories, cars conform to styling of the time, while some flying machines were based on the design of [[helicopter]]s of the mid-twentieth century.  Also of note was Lex O'Malley's ship, the ''Poseidon'', a versatile craft that could operate as a [[jetfoil]] as well as a submarine.\n\n[[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] used overhead [[monorail]]s and helibuses in early stories. Ground transport cars were also drawn with [[gyroscopes]] and single wheels.\n\nVenusian vehicles were depicted as being technologically more advanced than those of Earth. South of the Flamebelt the Therons had applied their technology to peaceful agricultural purposes including dedicated agricultural land and flying machines. North of the Flamebelt the Treens perfected low friction/low energy consumption means of transport including vacuum tube transport (Electrosenders) for long distance travel.\n\n====Spaceports====\nThere is evidence that the Spacefleet spaceport on Earth is west of [[Formby]] in [[Lancashire]] on a semicircle of land built into the [[Irish Sea]] by [[landfill]].\n\n====Spacesuits====\nSpacefleet spacesuits had a [[corselet plate]] like on [[Siebe Gorman]] [[standard diving suit]]s. Their suit had no [[life-support]] backpack; the life-support gear was between two layers of the helmet.\n\nAll or most Dan Dare comic pictures were drawn from models or posed humans. As a result, the Spacefleet [[spacesuit]]s in space hang in folds like the [[boilersuit]] in which the models posed and show no sign of gas pressure. After the first Venus war, Spacefleet spacesuits had propulsor backpacks copied from a Treen or [[Therons|Theron]] design.\n\nSome other spacesuits such as Blasco's have life-support backpacks.\n\n====The 1960s====\nIn 1960 artwork was taken over by Frank Bellamy, Don Harley, [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]], [[Gerald Palmer (comics)|Gerald Palmer]], with [[Bruce Cornwell]], and the look changed, with the colourful, rounded rocket ships replaced by angular silver craft, and changes to the space suits and insignia. The changes were never wholeheartedly taken up, however, and the look was erratic from then on. In 1962 the strip was removed from the front to the inside of the comic, in black and white, and was drawn by Keith Watson. Over the remaining years the strip varied in format and quality, eventually returning to the front page in colour, until it ended in 1967 with Dan retiring to become Space Fleet controller. Strips from the 1950s were reprinted until 1969, when ''Eagle'' merged with ''[[Lion (comic)|Lion]]''. For a while the reprints continued in black and white in ''Lion''.\n\n===''2000 AD''===\nIn 1977, Dan Dare appeared again in the first issue of ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' (26 February 1977). The first instalment, scripted by Ken Armstrong and [[Pat Mills]], had the character revived from suspended animation after two hundred years to find himself in a different world. The Mekon had also survived but otherwise the cast was different, as was the tone of the strip (heavily influenced by the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement, as was much of ''2000 AD'') and the personality of the title character. Written by [[Kelvin Gosnell]] and then Steve Moore, the strip was initially illustrated by [[Massimo Bellardinelli]], whose Dare owed nothing to the original apart from the wavy eyebrows. After 23 issues in this format the strip took a break for a month and then returned in a revamped format with a more realistic style, written by [[Gerry Finley-Day]] and Jack Adrian (Chris Lowder) and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]]. Dare was now launched on a deep space mission, much in the style of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' but with technology designs very much influenced by ''[[Star Wars]]''. In a series of episodic adventures, Dare encountered various threats, including an extended multi-episode adventure uniting slave races in opposition to the \"Star Slayers\" \u2013 the oppressive race controlling that region. The overall mission had a surprisingly downbeat ending, leaving a space-suited Dare the only survivor, adrift in space on wreckage.\n\nThe strip was rested for 14 issues, returning early in 1979 in ''2000 AD'''s 100th issue. The amnesiac Dare is rescued from space by the Mekon and indoctrinated into the Mekon's army before eventually recovering his memory. Now penned by [[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]] but still drawn by Dave Gibbons, this re-imagining of Dare casts him almost as a superhero with a colourful tight-fitting uniform provided by the Mekon. Dare escapes to a planet that is home to an amphibian-like race, which claims he is their Chosen One. There he receives a semi-mystical glove that can shoot energy beams but is unable to prevent the Mekon from acquiring the mystical Crystal of Life. On his return to Earth, he and his Treen companion Sondar find themselves branded traitors and found guilty of helping the Mekon to steal the Crystal. This story arc concluded with the pair escaping the Earth authorities and going on the run to try to clear their names by tracking down the Mekon and recovering the Crystal, establishing the format for the next story arc. Despite promises that Dare and Sondar would be back, the ''2000 AD'' Dan Dare strip \"Attack on Eternium\" ended here in prog 126 (18 August 1979).\n\nIn 1997, to celebrate their 20th anniversary, ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' published two issues with additional free comics, the first a reprint of the first issue of ''2000 AD'', which starred Dan Dare. The second free comic was a speculative issue called ''3000 AD'' which contained strips partially based on the first issue of ''2000 AD''. One strip was entitled \"The Return of Dan Dare\", which also featured the return of the Mekon.\n\n===The new ''Eagle''===\nIn 1982 ''Eagle'' was re-launched, with ''Dan Dare'' again its flagship strip. The new character was the great-great-great-grandson of the original hero\u2014the only surviving character from the original strip being the Mekon. The initial artist was [[Gerry Embleton]], who drew Dan to resemble the original exactly, but he was quickly replaced by [[Ian Kennedy (comic artist)|Ian Kennedy]], who gave the hero a younger look and blond hair.\n\nThe opening ''Dan Dare'' story was an epic, lasting 18 months, written by [[Pat Mills]] and [[John Wagner]]. It opened with a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the unseen final defeat of the Mekon by the original Dan, after which he was sealed inside an artificial [[asteroid]] and exiled into space. Centuries later he was accidentally freed and returned to conquer Earth. A few years later the descendant of his sworn enemy returned from space to find Earth under Treen rule and set out to free the planet. His new cast included Lt Helen Scott, leader of the Earth Resistance, and Valdon, a renegade Treen similar to the earlier Sondar. One controversial aspect of the strip was a lengthy flashback which [[retcon]]ned the original Dan to be a veteran of the Second World War and to have travelled through time to the era in which his adventures in the original ''Eagle'' took place\u2014an attempt to explain why a hero in the age of space travel had a 1950s outlook on life.\n\nAfter this initial storyline other writers were used and different supporting characters came and went, including Professor Pinkerton, a female scientist similar to Professor Peabody, and a new Digby (again, a descendant of the original). The Mekon was generally the foe in alternate stories.\n\nIn 1987 the strip became more like a [[space opera]], with increasing violence. Now drawn by John Gillatt, Dan took on a tough-guy look. He led space commandos and packed a hi-tech gun reminiscent of that carried by [[Judge Dredd]].\n\nThe original strip, featuring the original characters of the 1950s ''Eagle'', was revived in 1989, with artist [[Keith Watson (artist)|Keith Watson]]  providing the artwork for the initial run of stories. Watson had been part of the Dan Dare team from 1958 to 1960 and was sole artist on ''Dan Dare'' from 1962 to 1967. The new ''Eagle'' ended in 1994.\n\n===''Revolver''===\nIn 1990, a strip entitled ''Dare'', written by [[Grant Morrison]] and drawn by [[Rian Hughes]], was serialised in ''[[Revolver Comic (UK)|Revolver]]''. It presented bleak and cynical characters and was a not-too-subtle satire of 1980s [[British politics]]. Spacefleet had been privatised, the Treens were subjected to racist abuse in urban ghettos, Digby was unemployed, Professor Peabody committed suicide, and Dare's mentor Sir Hubert Guest betrayed Dare to [[the Mekon]] and his quisling British Prime Minister, Gloria Monday (whose appearance and demeanour appear modelled on [[Margaret Thatcher]]). Ultimately, Dare destroys London, the Mekon and himself through a smuggled nuclear weapon. The last episode appeared in ''[[Crisis (Fleetway)|Crisis]]'', following ''Revolver'''s cancellation.\n\n===''The Planet''===\nIn 1996, ''The Planet'' published its first and only issue. Inside was a new and unfinished Dan Dare story, \"Remembrance\", drawn by [[Sydney Jordan]] featuring a slightly older Dare and apparently set some years after the original Eagle strips.\n\n===Virgin Comics===\nIn 2007\u20132008 [[Virgin Comics]] published a 7 issue Dan Dare [[mini-series]] written by [[Garth Ennis]], with art by [[Gary Erskine]].<ref>[http://www.2000ad.nu/spacefleet/virgin/ Gary Erskine's page on ''Dan Dare'']</ref>  Virgin's founder and chairman [[Richard Branson]] is a fan of the character.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970907.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562 Virgin takes up 'Dare'], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], August 26, 2007</ref> The series is set several years after the original strips. Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result, with the [[Royal Navy]] taking Space Fleet's role. Peabody is the [[Home Secretary]] to a [[Prime Minister]] modelled on [[Tony Blair]], who has sold [[Earth]]'s defence out to [[The Mekon]] out of fear of overwhelming odds. Dare, assisted by Digby (who sacrifices himself in battle) leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.\n\n===''Spaceship Away''===\nLaunched in October 2003, [http://www.spaceshipaway.org.uk Spaceship Away] magazine was originally created in order to get \"The Phoenix Mission\" (a 1950s style story by Rod Barzilay with art by Keith Watson and Don Harley) into publication, with the agreement of the Dan Dare Corporation. Response was good enough to warrant the magazine's continuation following that strip's conclusion, initially with \"Green Nemesis\" (again by Barzilay and Don Harley, with later chapters drawn by David Pugh and Tim Booth. Other stories have since followed.\n\nDespite a fairly small circulation (it is available only via mail order, through its own Web site or in a select few comic shops), ''Spaceship Away'' continues to appear three times a year.\n\n===Titan Comics===\nIn 2017\u201318 a four-issue mini-series by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Alberto Foche]] was published \n by [[Titan Comics]].<ref>\"Dare to be Different\" by Stephen Jewell, ''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #390, 2017</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Radio===\n\n====Radio Luxembourg serial====\n[[Image:dandare.jpg|thumb|This ad for the Dan Dare ''pilot of the future'' serial appeared in the '''[[Radio Luxembourg (English)|208]]''' magazine in March 1952]]\n''The New Adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future'' aired five times a week on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for five years from 2 July 1951.

The dialogue was straight from wartime upper class RAF officers' slang.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future (TV Series)|Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'' became a [[3D computer graphics|computer-generated]] TV series produced first by [[Netter Digital]] then by [[Foundation Imaging]], running to twenty-six 22-minute episodes. The series drew on several comic book incarnations. It started on [[Nicktoons UK]] on 5 November 2005 at 6.30&nbsp;pm. Two abortive attempts had been made to make a live-action series, in 1981 and 1991. [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]] and [[Robert Bathurst]] were reportedly lined up to play Dare respectively. In 1991 a short pilot starring Bathurst as Dare, and [[Geoffrey Hughes]] as Digby was made.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Dare Remembered |author=John Freeman |work=Down The Tubes |url=http://www.downthetubes.net/features/comics_characters/dan_dare/dan_dare.html |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044443/http://www.downthetubes.net/features/comics_characters/dan_dare/dan_dare.html |archivedate=May 2, 2012 }}</ref> Parts of it were broadcast in an ITV documentary, ''Future Perfect''.\n\n===Film===\nIn 2010, [[Variety.com|Variety]] announced that [[Warner Bros.]] was planning to produce a Dan Dare movie starring [[Sam Worthington]] in the title role.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Warner Bros. takes on space 'Dare'|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/markets-festivals/warner-bros-takes-on-space-dare-1118022089/|website=Variety.com|accessdate=12 May 2016|date=2010-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Computer games===\nDuring the 1980s Dan Dare starred in three computer games for the [[Commodore 64]]/128, [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]] and [[Atari]] computers. The first was a different game on each system; the second and third were shoot'em-ups. All three were based on the 1950s strip rather than the contemporary comics.\n\n*''[[Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future]]'' (1986, Electronic Arts, re-released by Ricochet)\n*''Dan Dare II: The Mekon's Revenge'' (1988, Virgin Games, re-released by Ricochet)\n*''Dan Dare III: The Escape'' (1990, Virgin Games)\n\n===Music===\n[[Pink Floyd]] founder [[Syd Barrett]] wrote Dan Dare into his song \"Astronomy Domine\", from the band's debut album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', with the line \"Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?\"\n\n[[David Bowie]]'s song \"D.J.\" contains the somewhat obscure lyric: \"I feel like Dan Dare lies down\"\n\nSir [[Elton John]] recorded \"Dan Dare (Pilot Of The Future)\" for his 1975 album ''Rock Of The Westies''.\n\nBritish punk rock group The Mekons included a song \"Dan Dare\" on their album ''The Quality of Mercy is not Strnen''.\n \nThe album [[Below the Waste]] by the [[Art of Noise]] opened with the song \"Dan Dare\"\n\nThe relaunch of the [[Eagle Magazine]] in 1982 saw a free single giveaway of a track called ''Dan Dare'' by the group Loose Talk.\n\n==Characters inspired by Dan Dare==\nCharacters inspired by or based on Dan Dare have appeared throughout British popular culture. One example is Wing Commander Leyton in ''British Summertime'' by [[Paul Cornell]], which juxtaposes the utopian future portrayed in the original comics with the Britain of today.\n\nIn the 1980s, ''[[Private Eye]]'' published ''Dan Dire, Pilot of Future?''. Dire was based on politician [[Neil Kinnock]], the question being whether he'd ever become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Dire's enemy was the Maggon, a combination of [[the Mekon]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>'Sufferin' Satellites, Dan Dare is Back!', [[the Independent]], 14 April 1990</ref>\n\nRadio DJ and Comedian [[Kenny Everett]]'s character Captain Kremmen was inspired by Dan Dare.\n\nA porcine pastiche, ''[[Ham Dare: Pig of the Future]]'', written by [[Lew Stringer]] and with art by [[Malcolm Douglas (illustrator)|Malcolm Douglas]], appeared in ''[[Oink! (comic)|Oink!]]'' comic.<ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/ham-dare/4005-87799/ Comic Vine]</ref>\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] created a Dan Dare-esque character in their [[Captain Britain]] line in the 1980s. The character was Roy Risk, one of the [[United Kingdom|British]] heroes killed by [[Fury (Marvel comics)|The Fury]].\n\nIn [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' series, the character [[Smasher (Marvel Comics)|Smasher]]'s secret identity is astronomer Isabel 'Izzy' Dare whose dying elderly grandfather alludes to Izzy as inheriting a destiny from him.  He hand her a business card that expresses a deep friendship with [[Captain America]].  The card reveals the grandfather's name as Dan.  In the trade hardcover for Avengers, Izzy's last name is changed to Kane, meaning her grandfather is Marvel's Captain Terror.\n\nIn his Afterword to ''[[Ministry of Space]]'', [[Warren Ellis]] lists Dan Dare as one of the inspirations for the story, in which Britain forges an ambitious space programme in the decades following World War II. Sir John Dashwood, the central character of ''Ministry of Space'', is a cynical version of Dan Dare himself.<ref>Ellis, W: \"Ministry Of Space\", 'The Afterword'. Titan Books, 2005</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Jack Harkness]], the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' character, has several similarities to Dan Dare. The script for the episode \"[[The Empty Child]]\" in which Captain Jack makes his first appearance describes him as having \"the jawline of Dan Dare, the smile of a bastard\".<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Doctor Who: The Shooting Scripts\n  | publisher = [[BBC Books]]\n  | year = 2005\n  | location =\n  | page = 323\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0-563-48641-1}}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\nMost of the 1950s and 1960s strips were reprinted by [[Hawk Books]] between 1987 and 1995.\n# ''Pilot of the Future''\n# ''[[The Red Moon Mystery]]'' and ''[[Marooned on Mercury]]''\n# ''[[Operation Saturn (Dan Dare)|Operation Saturn]]''\n# ''[[Prisoners of Space]]''\n# ''[[The Man from Nowhere (comics)|The Man from Nowhere]]''\n# ''[[Rogue Planet (Dan Dare)|Rogue Planet]]''\n# ''Reign of the Robots'' and ''The Ship That Lived''\n# ''The Phantom Fleet''\n# ''Terra Nova'' trilogy\n# ''Project Nimbus''\n# ''Solid Space Mystery''\n# ''The Final Volume''\n\nStories left out were :\n* ''Operation Earthsavers'' (v13, 10\u201323)\n* ''The Evil One'' (v13, 24\u201332)\n* ''Operation Fireball'' (v13, 33\u201342)\n* ''The Web of Fear'' (v13, 43\u201352)\n* ''Operation Dark Star'' (v14, 1\u20139)\n* ''Operation Time Trap'' (v14, 10\u201338)\n* ''The Wandering World'' (v14, 39 \u2013 v15, 13)\n* ''The Big City Caper'' (v15, 14\u201322)\n* ''The Singing Scourge'' (v16, 30 \u2013 v17, 6)\n* ''Give Me The Moon'' (v17, 7\u201326)\n\nIn 2004, [[Titan Books]] began collecting the series from the beginning of the Hampson run in dust-jacketed hardback editions.
