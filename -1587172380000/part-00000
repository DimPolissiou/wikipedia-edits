Other common [[newspaper format]]s include the smaller [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]/[[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] formats.\n\n==Description==\n{{comparison newspaper size.svg}}\nMany broadsheets measure roughly {{convert|29+1/2|by|23+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} per full broadsheet spread, twice the size of a standard tabloid. Australian and New Zealand broadsheets always have a paper size of [[ISO 216|A1]] per spread ({{convert|841|by|594|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}). South African broadsheet newspapers have a double-page spread sheet size of {{convert|820|by|578|mm|in|abbr=on}} (single-page live print area of 380 x 545&nbsp;mm). Others measure 22 in (560 mm) vertically.\n\nIn the United States, the traditional dimensions for the front page half of a broadsheet are {{convert|15|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|22+3/4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} long.

Some quote actual page size and others quote the \"printed area\" size.\n\nThe two versions of the broadsheet are:\n*The full broadsheet typically is folded vertically in half so that it forms four pages (the front page front and back and the back page front and back). The four pages are called a spread. Inside broadsheets are nested accordingly.\n*The half broadsheet is usually an inside page that is not folded vertically and just includes a front and back.\n\nIn uncommon instances, an entire newspaper can be a two-page half broadsheet or four-page full broadsheet. Self-contained advertising circulars inserted in a newspaper in the same format are referred to as broadsheets.\n\nBroadsheets typically are also folded horizontally in half to accommodate newsstand display space. The horizontal fold, however, does not affect the page numbers and the content remains vertical. The most important newspaper stories are placed \"above the (horizontal) fold\".  This contrasts with tabloids, which typically do not have a horizontal fold (although tabloids usually have the four page-to-a-sheet spread format).\n\nThe broadsheet has since emerged as the most popular format for the dissemination of printed news. The world's most widely circulated English-language daily broadsheet is ''[[The Times of India]]'', a leading English-language [[daily newspaper]] from [[India]], followed closely by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' from the United States, according to the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]].\n\n==History==\nThe broadsheet, [[broadside (printing)|broadside]], was used as a format for [[Broadside ballad|musical]] and [[popular print]]s in the 17th century. \nEventually, people began using the broadsheet as a source for political activism by reprinting speeches.\n\nBroadsheet newspapers developed after the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] in 1712 placed a [[tax]] on newspapers based on the number of their pages. Larger formats, however, had long been signs of status in printed objects, and still are in many places, and outside Britain, the broadsheet developed for other reasons, including style and authority, unrelated to the British tax structure.\n\nWith the early mechanization of the 19th century came an increased production of printed materials including the broadside, as well as the competing [[penny dreadful]]. In this period, newspapers all over Europe began to print their issues on broadsheets. However, in the United Kingdom, the main competition for the broadside was the gradual reduction of the newspaper tax, beginning in the 1830s, and eventually its dismissal in 1855.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/broadsides/background.html|title=The Word on the Street \u2013  Background|publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]]|accessdate=10 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205045739/http://www.nls.uk/broadsides/background.html|archivedate=5 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWith the increased production of newspapers and literacy, the demand for visual reporting and journalists led to the blending of broadsides and newspapers, creating the modern broadsheet [[newspaper]].\n\n==Printing considerations==\nModern printing facilities most efficiently print broadsheet sections in multiples of eight pages (with four front pages and four back pages). The broadsheet is then cut in half during the process. Thus, the newsprint rolls used are defined by the width necessary to print four front pages. The width of a newsprint roll is called its web. The new 12-inch-wide front page broadsheet newspapers in the United States use a 48-inch web newsprint roll.\n\nWith profit margins narrowing for newspapers in the wake of competition from broadcast, cable television, and the internet, newspapers are looking to standardize the size of the newsprint roll. ''The Wall Street Journal'' with its 12-in-wide front page was printed on 48-inch web newsprint. Early adopters in the downsizing of broadsheets used a 50-inch web ({{frac|12|1|2}}-inch front pages). However, the 48-inch web is now rapidly becoming the definitive standard in the U.S. ''[[The New York Times]]'' held out on the downsizing until July 2006, saying it would stick to its 54-inch web ({{frac|13|1|2}}-inch front page){{cn|date=August 2018}}. However, the paper adopted the narrower format beginning Monday, 6 August 2007.\n\nThe smaller newspapers also have the advantage of being easier to handle, particularly among commuters.\n\n==Connotations==\nIn some countries, especially Australia, Canada, the UK, and the U.S., broadsheet newspapers are commonly perceived to be more intellectual in content than their tabloid counterparts.  They tend to use their greater size to publish stories exploring topics in-depth, while carrying less [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] and [[celebrity]]-oriented material. This distinction is most obvious on the front page; whereas tabloids tend to have a single story dominated by a headline, broadsheets allow two or more stories to be displayed, of which the most important sit at the top of the page\u2014\"[[above the fold]]\". In other countries, such as Spain, a small format is a universal standard for newspapers\u2014a popular, sensational press has had difficulty taking root\u2014and the tabloid-size does not carry pejorative connotations.\n\nA few newspapers, though, such as the German ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' and others throughout central Europe are tabloids in terms of content, but use the physical broadsheet format.\n\n==Switch to smaller sizes==\n\n===In the United Kingdom===\nIn 2003, ''The Independent'' started concurrent production of both broadsheet and tabloid (\"[[compact (newspaper)|compact]]\") editions, carrying exactly the same content. ''The Times'' did likewise, but with less apparent success, with readers vocally opposing the change. ''The Independent'' ceased to be available in broadsheet format in May 2004, and ''The Times'' followed suit from November 2004; ''[[The Scotsman]]'' is also now published only in tabloid format. ''[[The Guardian]]'' switched to the \"[[Berliner (format)|Berliner]]\" or \"midi\" format found in some other European countries (slightly larger than a traditional tabloid) on 12 September 2005. In June 2017, the ''Guardian'' announced it would again change the format to tabloid size &ndash; the first tabloid edition was published on 15 January 2018.\n\nThe main motivation cited for this shift is that [[commuter]]s prefer papers that they can hold easily on [[public transport]], and other readers hopefully will also find the smaller formats more convenient.\n\n===In the United States===\nIn the United States, ''The Wall Street Journal'' made headlines when it announced its overseas version would convert to a tabloid on 17 October 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=Milt Freudenheim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/business/health/media-abroad-the-wall-street-journal-will-be-a-tabloid.html|title=Abroad, The Wall Street Journal Will Be a Tabloid|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 May 2005|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> Strong debate occurred in the U.S. on whether or not the rest of the national papers will, or even should, follow the trend of the British papers and ''The Wall Street Journal''.<ref>[http://www.deadlinkarticles.blogspot.com/2016/04/for-american-publishers-broadsheets-are.html \"For American Publishers, Broadsheets Are Bright Stars].

Some quote actual page size and others quote the \"printed area\" size.\n\nThe two versions of the broadsheet are:\n*The full broadsheet typically is folded vertically in half so that it forms four pages (the front page front and back and the back page front and back). The four pages are called a spread. Inside broadsheets are nested accordingly.\n*The half broadsheet is usually an inside page that is not folded vertically and just includes a front and back.\n\nIn uncommon instances, an entire newspaper can be a two-page half broadsheet or four-page full broadsheet. Self-contained advertising circulars inserted in a newspaper in the same format are referred to as broadsheets.\n\nBroadsheets typically are also folded horizontally in half to accommodate newsstand display space. The horizontal fold, however, does not affect the page numbers and the content remains vertical. The most important newspaper stories are placed \"above the (horizontal) fold\".  This contrasts with tabloids, which typically do not have a horizontal fold (although tabloids usually have the four page-to-a-sheet spread format).\n\nThe broadsheet has since emerged as the most popular format for the dissemination of printed news. The world's most widely circulated English-language daily broadsheet is ''[[The Times of India]]'', a leading English-language [[daily newspaper]] from [[India]], followed closely by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' from the United States, according to the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]].\n\n==History==\nThe broadsheet, [[broadside (printing)|broadside]], was used as a format for [[Broadside ballad|musical]] and [[popular print]]s in the 17th century. \nEventually, people began using the broadsheet as a source for political activism by reprinting speeches.\n\nBroadsheet newspapers developed after the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] in 1712 placed a [[tax]] on newspapers based on the number of their pages. Larger formats, however, had long been signs of status in printed objects, and still are in many places, and outside Britain, the broadsheet developed for other reasons, including style and authority, unrelated to the British tax structure.\n\nWith the early mechanization of the 19th century came an increased production of printed materials including the broadside, as well as the competing [[penny dreadful]]. In this period, newspapers all over Europe began to print their issues on broadsheets. However, in the United Kingdom, the main competition for the broadside was the gradual reduction of the newspaper tax, beginning in the 1830s, and eventually its dismissal in 1855.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/broadsides/background.html|title=The Word on the Street \u2013  Background|publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]]|accessdate=10 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205045739/http://www.nls.uk/broadsides/background.html|archivedate=5 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWith the increased production of newspapers and literacy, the demand for visual reporting and journalists led to the blending of broadsides and newspapers, creating the modern broadsheet [[newspaper]].\n\n==Printing considerations==\nModern printing facilities most efficiently print broadsheet sections in multiples of eight pages (with four front pages and four back pages). The broadsheet is then cut in half during the process. Thus, the newsprint rolls used are defined by the width necessary to print four front pages. The width of a newsprint roll is called its web. The new 12-inch-wide front page broadsheet newspapers in the United States use a 48-inch web newsprint roll.\n\nWith profit margins narrowing for newspapers in the wake of competition from broadcast, cable television, and the internet, newspapers are looking to standardize the size of the newsprint roll. ''The Wall Street Journal'' with its 12-in-wide front page was printed on 48-inch web newsprint. Early adopters in the downsizing of broadsheets used a 50-inch web ({{frac|12|1|2}}-inch front pages). However, the 48-inch web is now rapidly becoming the definitive standard in the U.S. ''[[The New York Times]]'' held out on the downsizing until July 2006, saying it would stick to its 54-inch web ({{frac|13|1|2}}-inch front page){{cn|date=August 2018}}. However, the paper adopted the narrower format beginning Monday, 6 August 2007.\n\nThe smaller newspapers also have the advantage of being easier to handle, particularly among commuters.\n\n==Connotations==\nIn some countries, especially Australia, Canada, the UK, and the U.S., broadsheet newspapers are commonly perceived to be more intellectual in content than their tabloid counterparts.  They tend to use their greater size to publish stories exploring topics in-depth, while carrying less [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] and [[celebrity]]-oriented material. This distinction is most obvious on the front page; whereas tabloids tend to have a single story dominated by a headline, broadsheets allow two or more stories to be displayed, of which the most important sit at the top of the page\u2014\"[[above the fold]]\". In other countries, such as Spain, a small format is a universal standard for newspapers\u2014a popular, sensational press has had difficulty taking root\u2014and the tabloid-size does not carry pejorative connotations.\n\nA few newspapers, though, such as the German ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' and others throughout central Europe are tabloids in terms of content, but use the physical broadsheet format.\n\n==Switch to smaller sizes==\n\n===In the United Kingdom===\nIn 2003, ''The Independent'' started concurrent production of both broadsheet and tabloid (\"[[compact (newspaper)|compact]]\") editions, carrying exactly the same content. ''The Times'' did likewise, but with less apparent success, with readers vocally opposing the change. ''The Independent'' ceased to be available in broadsheet format in May 2004, and ''The Times'' followed suit from November 2004; ''[[The Scotsman]]'' is also now published only in tabloid format. ''[[The Guardian]]'' switched to the \"[[Berliner (format)|Berliner]]\" or \"midi\" format found in some other European countries (slightly larger than a traditional tabloid) on 12 September 2005. In June 2017, the ''Guardian'' announced it would again change the format to tabloid size &ndash; the first tabloid edition was published on 15 January 2018.\n\nThe main motivation cited for this shift is that [[commuter]]s prefer papers that they can hold easily on [[public transport]], and other readers hopefully will also find the smaller formats more convenient.\n\n===In the United States===\nIn the United States, ''The Wall Street Journal'' made headlines when it announced its overseas version would convert to a tabloid on 17 October 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=Milt Freudenheim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/business/health/media-abroad-the-wall-street-journal-will-be-a-tabloid.html|title=Abroad, The Wall Street Journal Will Be a Tabloid|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 May 2005|accessdate=10 August 2012}}</ref> Strong debate occurred in the U.S. on whether or not the rest of the national papers will, or even should, follow the trend of the British papers and ''The Wall Street Journal''.<ref>[http://www.deadlinkarticles.blogspot.com/2016/04/for-american-publishers-broadsheets-are.html \"For American Publishers, Broadsheets Are Bright Stars].

Freeman attended [[Yale University]], which at the time was Yale College, beginning in 1912, and graduated in 1916. He then moved on to study [[neurology]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania Medical School]]. While attending medical school, he studied the work of William Spiller and idolized his groundbreaking work in the new field of the neurological sciences. Spiller also worked in Philadelphia and was credited by many in the world of [[psychology]] as being the founder of neurology.

Freeman was born on November 14, 1895, and raised in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], by his parents. Freeman's grandfather, [[William Williams Keen]], was well known as a surgeon in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. His father was also a very successful doctor. Freeman attended [[Yale University]], which at the time was Yale College, beginning in 1912, and graduated in 1916. He then moved on to study [[neurology]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania Medical School]]. While attending medical school, he studied the work of William Spiller and idolized his groundbreaking work in the new field of the neurological sciences. Spiller also worked in Philadelphia and was credited by many in the world of [[psychology]] as being the founder of neurology.
