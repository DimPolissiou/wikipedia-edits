As the demand in the New World grew, so did the knowledge on how to cultivate it. The two primary species used were [[Oryza glaberrima]] and [[Oryza sativa]], originating from West Africa and Southeast Asia respectively. Slaveholders in the New World relied upon the skills of enslaved Africans to further cultivate both species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carney|first=Judith A.|date=2001|title=African Rice in the Columbian Exchange|jstor=3647168|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=377\u2013396|doi=10.1017/s0021853701007940}}</ref> North and South Carolina were key places where rice was grown during the slave trade, and islands of the Caribbean like Puerto Rico and Cuba were equally great centers of production. Enslaved Africans brought their knowledge of water control, milling, winnowing, and other general agrarian practices to the fields. This widespread knowledge amongst enslaved Africans eventually led to rice becoming a staple dietary item in the New World.<ref name=\"Harvard University Press\"/>\n\n==== Fruits ====\nCitrus fruits and grapes were brought to the Americas from the Mediterranean. At first these crops struggled to adapt to the climate in the New World but by the late 19th century they were growing more consistently.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNeill |first1=J.R. |title=The Columbian Exchange |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/columbian-exchange |website=[[NCpedia]] |publisher=[[State Library of North Carolina]] |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n<!-- The guava plant ([[Diospyros mespiliformis]]) originated in West Africa and is now grown in Hawaii, Florida and areas of California.\n\ncite book |last1=Twitty |first1=Michael |title=The Cooking Gene |date=2017 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishing |page=293}}\n\nNo, a) the guava is native to South America, b) Diospyros Mespiliformis is not the guava, it's the jackalberry.

Tobacco, potatoes, [[chili peppers]], [[tomatillos]], and tomatoes are all members of the [[nightshade family]]. All of these plants bear some resemblance to the [[European nightshade]] that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries. Similar to some European Nightshade varieties, tomatoes and potatoes can be harmful or even lethal, if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \"melancholic humours\".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' \"had arrived safely\". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.<ref name=Gentilcore>''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', [[David Gentilcore]] (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, \"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces\". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with [[tomato sauce]] was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|32000|acres|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.<ref name=Gentilcore/>\n\n===Livestock===\n{{further|Plains Indians#The horse}}\nInitially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals. [[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s, large [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[bee]]s were rapidly adopted by native peoples for transport, food, and other uses.<ref name=\"Francis2006-livestock\">{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Michael Francis, John|encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|title=Columbian Exchange\u2014Livestock| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMNoS-g1h8cC&pg=PA303|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-421-9|pages=303\u2013308}}</ref> One of the first European exports to the Americas, the horse, changed the lives of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. The mountain tribes shifted to a [[nomadic]] lifestyle, as opposed to [[agriculture]], based on hunting [[bison]] on horseback and moved down to the [[Great Plains]]. The existing Plains tribes expanded their territories with horses, and the animals were considered so valuable that horse herds became a measure of wealth.<ref>[[Evolution of the horse|This transfer reintroduced horses]] to the Americas, as the species had died out there prior to the development of the modern horse in Eurasia.</ref>\n\nThe effects of the introduction of European livestock on the environments and peoples of the New World were not always positive.

Many had migrated west across Eurasia [[natural reservoir|with animals]] or people, or were brought by traders from Asia, so diseases of two continents were suffered by all occupants. While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].\n\nBy contrast, Old World diseases had a devastating effect when introduced via European carriers, as the native people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases. [[Measles]] caused many deaths.

For example, in the article \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45\u201346</ref> This clash of culture involved the transfer of European values to indigenous cultures. As an example, the emergence of the concept of private property in regions where property was often viewed as communal, concepts of monogamy (although many indigenous peoples were already monogomous,) the role of women and children in the social system, and the \"superiority of free labor,\"<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref> although slavery was already an well established practice among many indigenous people. Another example included the European deprecation of human sacrifice, an established religious practice among some indigenous populations. Another example of cultural clash occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands. For these Europeans, seeking economic opportunity and homesteads, this indicated to them that the land was unimproved and available for the taking. When the English entered Virginia they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for growing useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as hallmarks of civilization they set about transforming \"the land into something more suitable for themselves\".<ref>Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050</ref> In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. \n\nTobacco was a New World agricultural product, originally a luxury good spread as part of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493\u20131588) noted that \"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\".<ref>Monardes, Nicholas. \"Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues\".

Demand for tobacco grew in the course of these cultural exchanges among peoples.\n\nWhile [[Mapuche]] people did adopt the horse, sheep, and wheat, the over-all scant adoption of Spanish technology by Mapuche has been characterized as mean of [[Resistance through culture|cultural resistance]].<ref name=DilleMaterial2014/>\n\n==== Atlantic slave trade ====\n\n[[File:AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg|thumb|Enslaved Africans were chained and bound before taken on ships to the New World]]\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] was the transfer of Africans from primarily West Africa to parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th century.<ref name=\"Black Rice\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |url=https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn/page/2 2\u20138]}}</ref> About 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa.

The presence of enslaved Africans included skilled and unskilled labor and gave way to a new population which represented a hybrid of the two cultures.<ref name=\"Black Rice\"/> ''The Birth of African American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective'' is a book written by Sidney Mintz and Richard Price further detailing the cultural impact of enslaved Africans in America. Mintz and Price's book helped to publicize how integral the socialization aspects of plantation life were to the structures of black culture.\n\nThe treatment of enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade became one of the most controversial topics in the history of the New World. Slavery was abolished in 1865 in the United States and [[Slavery_in_Brazil|was ended in Brazil]] in 1888, but has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.\n\n==Organism examples==\n{{See also|New World crops|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Muisca agriculture|List of food origins}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70%\n|+ Post-Columbian transfers of native organisms with close ties to humans\n!

[[Invasive species]] of [[plant]]s and [[pathogen]]s also were introduced by chance, including such weeds as [[Salsola|tumbleweeds]] (''Salsola'' spp.) and [[Avena fatua|wild oats]] (''Avena fatua''). Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the [[kudzu|kudzu vine]] introduced in 1894 from [[Japan]] to the United States to help control [[soil erosion]], have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment.\n\nFungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for [[Dutch elm disease]], killing [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees. Some of the invasive species have become serious ecosystem and economic problems after establishing in the New World environments.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/simberloff.html | title=Introduced Species: The Threat to Biodiversity & What Can Be Done | author=Simberloff, Daniel | journal=American Institute of Biological Sciences: Bringing Biology to Informed Decision Making. | year=2000}}</ref><ref>Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, Joaquin and Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez Tasc\u00f3n (eds.)

In Ireland, the potato crop was totally destroyed; the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] caused millions to starve to death or emigrate.\n\nIn addition to these, many animals were introduced to new habitats on the other side of the world either accidentally or incidentally.

As the demand in the New World grew, so did the knowledge on how to cultivate it. The two primary species used were [[Oryza glaberrima]] and [[Oryza sativa]], originating from West Africa and Southeast Asia respectively.

Tobacco, potatoes, [[chili peppers]], [[tomatillos]], and tomatoes are all members of the [[nightshade family]]. All of these plants bear some resemblance to the [[European nightshade]] that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries. Similar to some European Nightshade varieties, tomatoes and potatoes can be harmful or even lethal, if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \"melancholic humours\".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' \"had arrived safely\". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.<ref name=Gentilcore>''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', [[David Gentilcore]] (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, \"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces\". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with [[tomato sauce]] was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|32000|acres|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.<ref name=Gentilcore/>\n\n===Livestock===\n{{further|Plains Indians#The horse}}\nInitially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals.

While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].\n\nBy contrast, Old World diseases had a devastating effect when introduced via European carriers, as the native people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases.

For example, in the article \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45\u201346</ref> This clash of culture involved the transfer of European values to indigenous cultures. As an example, the emergence of the concept of private property in regions where property was often viewed as communal, concepts of monogamy (although many indigenous peoples were already monogomous,) the role of women and children in the social system, and the \"superiority of free labor,\"<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref> although slavery was already an well established practice among many indigenous people. Another example included the European deprecation of human sacrifice, which was also an established religious practice among some indigenous populations. An example of cultural clash occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands. For these Europeans, seeking economic opportunity and homesteads, this indicated to them that the land was unimproved and available for the taking. When the English entered Virginia they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for growing useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as hallmarks of civilization they set about transforming \"the land into something more suitable for themselves\".<ref>Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050</ref> In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. \n\nTobacco was a New World agricultural product, originally a luxury good spread as part of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493\u20131588) noted that \"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\".<ref>Monardes, Nicholas. \"Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues\".

Slavery was abolished in 1865 in the United States and [[Slavery_in_Brazil|was ended in Brazil]] in 1888, but has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.\n\n==Organism examples==\n{{See also|New World crops|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Muisca agriculture|List of food origins}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70%\n|+ Post-Columbian transfers of native organisms with close ties to humans\n!

[[Invasive species]] of [[plant]]s and [[pathogen]]s also were introduced by chance, including such weeds as [[Salsola|tumbleweeds]] (''Salsola'' spp.) and [[Avena fatua|wild oats]] (''Avena fatua''). Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the [[kudzu|kudzu vine]] introduced in 1894 from [[Japan]] to the United States to help control [[soil erosion]], have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment.\n\nFungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for [[Dutch elm disease]], killing [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees. Some of the invasive species have become serious ecosystem and economic problems after establishing in the New World environments.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/simberloff.html | title=Introduced Species: The Threat to Biodiversity & What Can Be Done | author=Simberloff, Daniel | journal=American Institute of Biological Sciences: Bringing Biology to Informed Decision Making. | year=2000}}</ref><ref>Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, Joaquin and Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez Tasc\u00f3n (eds.)

In Ireland, the potato crop was totally destroyed; the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] caused millions to starve to death or emigrate.\n\nIn addition to these, many animals were introduced to new habitats on the other side of the world either accidentally or incidentally. These include such animals as [[brown rat]]s, [[earthworm]]s (apparently absent from parts of the pre-Columbian New World), and [[zebra mussel]]s, which arrived on ships.<ref name = \"Hoddle\">{{cite web |first=M.

Ancient game enjoys continued popularity|url=http://thecourier.com/life-news/2016/06/23/mahjong/|work=The Courier}}</ref> Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four [[#Melds|melds]] (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and Honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Despite these similarities, there are many regional variations to the rules including rather different scoring systems, criteria for legal winning hands, and even private table rules which distinguish some variations as notably different styles of mahjong.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u96c0}} ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still used in some southern dialects. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called [[Madiao]] which mahjong tiles were adapted from.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete book of Mah-Jongg|last=Millington|first=A.

Its name is similar in other languages, except in [[Thai language|Thai]], where it is called \u0e44\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e01 (''phai nok krachok''), a [[calque]] meaning \"sparrow cards.\"<ref>https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/28815/1/10672983.pdf</ref>\n\n== General rules ==\n[[File:Mahjong tiles on angle.jpg|thumb|A set of Mahjong tiles]]\n\nWhile mahjong itself has many variants, various game rules and mechanics are generally \"universal\".  Variations between mahjong forms rests on which game features are used or not.\n\n=== Game pieces and accessories ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\n\nOld Hong Kong Mahjong is played with a standard set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144); however, sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 3 categories: Suits, Honors, and Bonuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Mahjong tile count per set\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n!

The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"balls\", \"stones\", '\"marbles\" or \"coins\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in [[traditional Chinese characters]]) are the Chinese orthography of \"ten thousand\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.righto.com/chart.html |title=Mah Jongg Tiles and Names |author=Shirriff, Ken |publisher=righto.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are two different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons. The Winds are East, South, West, and North. In Mahjong, East (not North) is the beginning. The Dragons are Red, Green, and White. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank and are typically known as \u767d\u677f (b\u00e1ib\u0103n) \"whiteboard\". These tiles have no numerical sequence like the simples (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the simples, there are four identical copies of each Honors tile, for a total of 28 Honors tiles.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n|-\n|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n|-\n|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are two sets of Bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the Bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the Bonus tile.\n\nIn addition, unlike the Simple and Honors tiles, there is only a single tile of each Bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set.

There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of simple tiles (ex. 2 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the [[Four Gentlemen]] are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\n[[File:Chinese dice.jpg|thumb|Chinese dice]]\nThe dealer is chosen by various means. For example, each player throws dice with the highest count taking the dealer position, second-highest taking south etc. Or one player may place one tile of each wind face down and shuffle them. Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\n[[File:Tion-Mahjong.JPG|thumb|right|Cubic dealer and prevailing wind marker.]]\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with two extra hands played<br/>(per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand)\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\n\n====Stacking tiles====\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\n\n[[File:Mahjong table.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Walls with slight diagonal offset and player positions marked with cardinal directions, including the dealer (E), along with counting order]]\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees anti-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\n\n====Drawing tiles====\n\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting anti-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\n\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.\n\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement piece(s) from the wall in the anti-clockwise direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\n\n[[File:Mahjong 13th piece draw.svg|thumb|left|While drawing the 13th piece to complete the initial hand, the dealer (E) will typically also draw a 14th piece (both highlighted in blue) to initiate the game.]]\n\n====Game play starts====\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player in turn, in counterclockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the Bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out \"Mahjong\" while revealing their hand.\n\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\n#A Bonus tile (Flower or Season) is drawn\n#A meld (Pong, Kong, or Chow) is made from a discard\n#Going Mahjong (declaring a winning hand)\n#Robbing a Kong\n\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four ''melds'' (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the ''eyes'' (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is three but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\n\n==== Melds ====\n'''Melds''' are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a ''Pong'' (three identical tiles), a ''Kong'' (four identical tiles), a ''Chow'' (three Simple tiles all of the same suit, in numerical sequence), or ''Eyes'' (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\n\n* '''Pongs''' are a set of three identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any Simple or Honors tile. Bonus tiles (Flowers or Seasons) cannot be used to form a Pong because they are set aside and there are not three identical bonus tiles in the set. The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits). A Pong may either be concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing another player's discard).\n* '''Kong''' is a complete set of four identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong with an additional tile to make a complete set of four. There are three ways to form a Kong.\n:# ''Concealed Kong'' \u2013 If a player holds three matching tiles (concealed Pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four they may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing two pieces in the middle face up and two pieces on the ends face down.\n:# ''Exposed Kong'' \u2013 If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed Pong) in their hand, he can take the piece and reveal an \"exposed kong\" or \"melded kong\". The player reveals his three pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile, or face down next to the three other face up pieces.\n:# ''Exposed Kong from Exposed Pong'' \u2013 If a player already has a melded Pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, he may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it, it must be drawn.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The fourth piece of a Kong is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. A Kong may not be formed from Bonus tiles (Flowers/Seasons), since the set does not include four identical tiles. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and deprive opponents of the opportunity to obtain specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence and all in the same suit. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. Honors tiles cannot be used to make Chows because they have no numerical value, and Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons) also cannot be used to make a Chow.\n\nA player can steal a discard to form a Chow only from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs; however, a player forming a Chow from a seized piece has the lowest priority for that tile. Any other player who needs that tile to make a Pong, make a Kong, or to win may seize that piece instead. Like the Pong, the Chow is either concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing the prior player's discard).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are two identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''. North Clarendon, VT: [[Tuttle Publishing|Tuttle]], p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-3302-8}}.</ref>\n\nFor example:\n\n[[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]] [[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]]\n\n[[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]]\n\n==== Interruption of play ====\nThe regular anti-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:\n\n===== 1. Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, he may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== 2. Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\n\nWhen a meld (''Pong'', ''Kong,'' or ''Chow'') is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues anti-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\n\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n\n* # Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n* # Next priority goes to the player who declares a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' using the discard. A player who calls for a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a Mahjong set.\n\n* # Last priority goes to the player who declares a Chow using the discard. Players may only call for a ''Chow'' from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand.\n\n===== 3. Going Mahjong =====\n''Going Mahjong'' is the act of declaring a winning hand, either by stealing a discard or by drawing a winning tile.\n\n======From a discard======\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they yell out 'Mahjong!', take the discard and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to go mahjong (win the hand) there are two ways to resolve the issue depending on agreed table rules: Either the players count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, or the winner is simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn.\n\n======From the wall======\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\n\n===== 4. Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (either by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to go Mahjong (win the hand) and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the Kong.\n\n==== Examples of winning hands ====\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (Pongs, Kongs, or Chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n: [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n''Hand formed with four Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind. Only bamboo is used (no other simples), scoring extra points (clean hand). No chows are used (an all Pong/Kong hand scores extra points).''\n\n: [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt2-.svg|25px|2 Circle]] [[File:MJt3-.svg|25px|3 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]] [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]]\n''A high-scoring hand formed using only circles, known as a pure hand. Hand is made of Chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''seven different pairs'' and ''13 orphans'' are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n====False Mahjong====\nCalling out Mahjong! without having a complete (legal) hand or without the minimum points is usually penalized depending on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false mahjong must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand).\n\n==== Repeated hands ====\n\nIf the dealer wins the hand, he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\n\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a \"goulash hand\". Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\n\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum faan points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts all of his or her faan points.\n* faan points depend on:\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum faan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum faan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. in a three faan minimum game, if a player has two faan points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another faan point before calling mahjong. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins\n* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added his or her points (faan points plus bonus points) they must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"chips or points\") based on three factors:\n** the base points (faan points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer (doubles the points)\n\n==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand====\n\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another players discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong doesn't award concealed melds/hands as generously as others.

How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see [[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Base points (Old Hong Kong Simplified) \n! faan points !!

If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\n* If the winner wins from the wall his base points are doubled\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east all losers double the basepoints\n* If east player is a losing player he pays double the points to the winner.\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, he must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n!Hand !!

These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winners hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to go mahjong). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate if the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four Flowers and all four Seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\nIn all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (Maximum number of fan agreed)\n! width=10% | Hand !! width=90% | Explanation with example\n|-\n!

In mainland China alone, there are over thirty variants.<ref name=\"Games and Culture\">{{cite arxiv |last1=Wang |first1=Xianwen |last2=Mao |first2=Wenli |last3=Liu |first3=Chen |title=Games and Culture: Using Online-gaming Data to Cluster Chinese Regional Cultures |ref=Games and Culture|eprint=1310.0621 |class=cs.CY |year=2013 }}</ref> Many variations today differ only by scoring:\n\n* '''Chinese classical Mahjong''' is the oldest surviving variety of Mahjong and was the version introduced to America in the 1920s under various names. It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia. All players score and it is possible to score higher than the winner.\n* '''Hong Kong Mahjong''' or '''Cantonese Mahjong''' is a more common form of Mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi ({{lang|zh|\u8d56\u5b50}}), and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, and is called {{lang|zh|\u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760}}. Special tiles need to be discarded.\n* '''Changsha Mahjong''' is widely played in [[Hunan]] Province. Like Wuhan Mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha Mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.\n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which allegedly might be said in some regard to perhaps match the personality of north-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or nine in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''Taiwanese Mahjong''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''Filipino Mahjong''', sixteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. Honors are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Taiyuan Lisi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; {{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]}}), the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong]]''' are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements of Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kong'') are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different to most other variations.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''' has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Vietnamese Mahjong''' has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. Modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.\n* '''Japanese classical Mahjong''' is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores. \n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.<!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http://gamenoodle.blogspot.com/2012/09/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]</ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http://www.mahjongnews.com/en/index.php/ec-riichi/54-ec-2008/104-rmc2008.html]</ref>-->\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:korean-overview|title=Korean Mahjong Rules - Mahjong Wiki (\u9ebb\u5c06\u7ef4\u57fa)|website=mahjong.wikidot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amja.net/|title=The American Mah-Jongg Association \u2013 news, products and tournaments \u2013 Join us for our next American Mah-Jongg tournament or cruise!.}}</ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as Honors, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Legal hands are changed annually. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n\n'''[[Three player mahjong|Three-player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2\u20138 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.<ref>The Mahjong Wiki.[http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:three-player Three-player mahjong].

The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It prepares one wall while the players play one hand. After the hand is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and a new wall raises upwards. In theory the table should avoid cheating (by stacking the deck and or using loaded dice).\n\n====Tiles====\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=11|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!colspan=2|8\n!colspan=2|9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Suits\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=4|Honors/Bonus\n!colspan=4|Winds\n!colspan=3|Dragons\n!colspan=4|Bonus\n|-\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n!colspan=2|Seasons\n!colspan=2|Flowers\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJh1-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh2-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh5-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh6-.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|[[File:MJh3-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh4-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh7-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh8-.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no Honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\n\n==== Wild cards and jokers ====\n\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles can't be discarded and can only replace tiles in Chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\n\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\n[[File:Joker-vietnammj.JPG|right|thumb|Top eight are Vietnamese jokers. Bottom four are Chinese.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Wild card tile chosen !! Another wildcard\n|-\n| East || South\n|-\n| South || West\n|-\n| West || North\n|-\n| North || East\n|-\n| Red Dragon || Green Dragon\n|-\n| Green Dragon || White Dragon\n|-\n| White Dragon || Red Dragon\n|}\n\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\n\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n===== Flowers =====\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and three-player Mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\nFour of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|four noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5-.svg|50px|Plum]] [[File:MJh6-.svg|50px|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7-.svg|50px|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8-.svg|50px|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1-.svg|50px|Spring]] [[File:MJh2-.svg|50px|Summer]] [[File:MJh3-.svg|50px|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4-.svg|50px|Winter]]\n\nThese animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[rooster]] and [[centipede]]. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\n\n[[File:MJat1-.svg|50px|Cat]] [[File:MJat2-.svg|50px|Mouse]] [[File:MJat3-.svg|50px|Rooster]] [[File:MJat4-.svg|50px|Centipede]]\n\n===== Walls =====\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====\n[[File:Mahjong fiches.jpg|thumb|right|Mahjong counting sticks: Left are Chinese while the right are Japanese]]\nDepending on the variation, two or three [[dice]] are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\n\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\n\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), [[jeton]]s, [[play money]], paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\n\n==== Charleston ====\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Hands ===\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n==== Ready hands ====\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''13 orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|r\u012bchi|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|dora|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalised in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese \u6d41\u5c40 ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n==== Abortive draws ====\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e5d\u724c|Ky\u016bshu Ky\u016bhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|last=Gregory |first=Peter |url=http://mahjongbritishrules.com/scoring/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6-.svg|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1-.svg|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3-.svg|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo|Four Winds' barrier|\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u4eba\u7acb\u76f4|Yonin r\u012bchi}}: If all four players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo|Four Kongs' abort|\u56db\u69d3\u6563\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the fourth Kong is declared, unless all four Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n====Points====\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his hand is scored by adding his points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mahjong Variations\n!

The game is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. A two player version was published by [[Nintendo]]. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002. Left: John J. O'Connor (2nd place) In the middle: world champion Mai Hatsune, from Japan Right: Yuichi Ikeya (3rd place)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the [[2002 World Championship in Mahjong|first global tournament in Mahjong]] was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first [[Open European Mahjong Championship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |accessdate=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145919/http://mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players.

There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first [[World Mahjong Championship]] in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nOther major international tournaments include the [[Mahjong International League]]'s [[World Mahjong Sports Games]] and the privately sponsored [[World Series Of Mahjong]].\n\n[[American mahjong]] tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM). MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title='China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong'.

Each deck is divided into three suits of '''[[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]]''' or coins, '''[[String of cash coins (currency unit)|Strings]]''' of cash, and '''[[Myriad]]s''' of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]]. [[Khanhoo]] is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' ([[:zh:\u78b0\u548c|\u78b0\u548c]]) which was played with 120 or 150 cards.<ref name=Lo/> During the late 19th century, ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' was used interchangeably with ''m\u00e1qu\u00e8'' in both card and tile form.\n\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo/><ref name=\"Stanwick1\">{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162|ref=Stanwick1}}</ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

The game itself was banned during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976).<ref name=\"Lo\"/> Today, it is a favorite pastime in China<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.winmahjong.com/mahjong-in-china/ |title=Mahjong in China |publisher=Win Mahjong |accessdate=29 December 2014 }}</ref> and other Chinese-speaking communities.\n\n=== Mahjong in the West ===\n[[File:28.779 SL1 s.jpg|thumb|200px|Mahjong tiles of late 19th century, a gift of [[George B.

He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilkinson, W.H.|title=Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards|journal=The American Anthropologist|year=1895|volume=viii|pages=61\u201378|doi=10.1525/aa.1895.8.1.02a00070|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448960}}</ref> By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including [[French language|French]] and Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe game was imported to the United States in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recalling the Craze for a Game of Chance |first=Steven |last=Heller |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/arts/artsspecial/18MAH.html?ex=1285473600&en=37c8a4976aafc929&ei=5087&WT.mc_id=AR-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M143-ROS-0410-L2&WT.mc_ev=click}}</ref> The first Mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] starting in 1920. It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.</ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game'', written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''</ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a Jewish remake,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] before it went bankrupt and closed on October 10, 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\n[[File:Schoolkidsmahjong.jpg|thumb|200px|Students in the United States learning how to play Mahjong]]\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.</ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.</ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga!

Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\n\n[[Mahjong culture]] is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. [[Sam Hui]] wrote [[Cantopop|Cantopop songs]] using Mahjong as their themes, and [[Hong Kong]] movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.\nAlthough the popularity of the game in China is still big, since 1949, Mahjong was frown upon by the government because is seen as a means of [[Gambling in China|gambling]] addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.<ref>{{Cite web|title = China unveils restrictive new video game content guidelines|url = https://www.theburnin.com/lifestyle/china-video-game-censorship/|website = The Burn-In|access-date = 2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] according to a 2007 study.<ref>{{citation | title = Mah-jong\u2013induced seizures: case reports and review of twenty-three patients | url = http://www.hkmj.org/article_pdfs/hkm0708p314.pdf |author1=Richard S.K.

For example, players will try to find seats with the best [[Feng Shui]] or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand<ref>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Desmond|title=Chinese Gambling Superstitions and Taboos|url=http://www.urbino.net/articles.cfm?specificArticle=Chinese%20Gambling%20Superstitions%20and%20Taboos}}</ref>\n\nMore elaborated superstitions in Mahjong range from those found in the game poker, like not counting one's wins and losses, to the comical, like changing one's undergarments after a loss.

It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Southeast Asia]]). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have also become popular in Western countries.

Ancient game enjoys continued popularity|url=http://thecourier.com/life-news/2016/06/23/mahjong/|work=The Courier}}</ref> Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four [[#Melds|melds]] (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and Honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Despite these similarities, there are many regional variations to the rules including rather different scoring systems, criteria for legal winning hands, and even private table rules which distinguish some variations as notably different styles of mahjong.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u96c0}} ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still used in some southern dialects. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called [[Madiao]] which mahjong tiles were adapted from.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete book of Mah-Jongg|last=Millington|first=A.

Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144); however, sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 3 categories: Suits, Honors, and Bonuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Mahjong tile count per set\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n!

The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are 4 identical copies of each simples tile totaling 108 simples tiles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=9|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Simples\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|}\nThe bamboo suit is also known as \"sticks\" or \"bams\" suit; the first tile usually has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"balls\", \"stones\", '\"marbles\" or \"coins\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in [[traditional Chinese characters]]) are the Chinese orthography of \"ten thousand\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.righto.com/chart.html |title=Mah Jongg Tiles and Names |author=Shirriff, Ken |publisher=righto.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are two different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons. The Winds are East, South, West, and North. In Mahjong, East (not North) is the beginning. The Dragons are Red, Green, and White. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank and are typically known as \u767d\u677f (b\u00e1ib\u0103n) \"whiteboard\". These tiles have no numerical sequence like the simples (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the simples, there are four identical copies of each Honors tile, for a total of 28 Honors tiles.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n|-\n|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n|-\n|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are two sets of Bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the Bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the Bonus tile.\n\nIn addition, unlike the Simple and Honors tiles, there is only a single tile of each Bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flowers\n! No !!

There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of simple tiles (ex. 2 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the [[Four Gentlemen]] are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\n[[File:Chinese dice.jpg|thumb|Chinese dice]]\nThe dealer is chosen by various means. For example, each player throws dice with the highest count taking the dealer position, second-highest taking south etc. Or one player may place one tile of each wind face down and shuffle them. Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\n[[File:Tion-Mahjong.JPG|thumb|right|Cubic dealer and prevailing wind marker.]]\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with two extra hands played<br/>(per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand)\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\n\n====Stacking tiles====\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\n\n[[File:Mahjong table.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Walls with slight diagonal offset and player positions marked with cardinal directions, including the dealer (E), along with counting order]]\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees anti-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\n\n====Drawing tiles====\n\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting anti-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\n\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.\n\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement piece(s) from the wall in the anti-clockwise direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\n\n[[File:Mahjong 13th piece draw.svg|thumb|left|While drawing the 13th piece to complete the initial hand, the dealer (E) will typically also draw a 14th piece (both highlighted in blue) to initiate the game.]]\n\n====Game play starts====\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player in turn, in counterclockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the Bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out \"Mahjong\" while revealing their hand.\n\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\n#A Bonus tile (Flower or Season) is drawn\n#A meld (Pong, Kong, or Chow) is made from a discard\n#Going Mahjong (declaring a winning hand)\n#Robbing a Kong\n\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four ''melds'' (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the ''eyes'' (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is three but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\n\n==== Melds ====\n'''Melds''' are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a ''Pong'' (three identical tiles), a ''Kong'' (four identical tiles), a ''Chow'' (three Simple tiles all of the same suit, in numerical sequence), or ''Eyes'' (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\n\n* '''Pongs''' are a set of three identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any Simple or Honors tile. Bonus tiles (Flowers or Seasons) cannot be used to form a Pong because they are set aside and there are not three identical bonus tiles in the set. The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits). A Pong may either be concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing another player's discard).\n* '''Kong''' is a complete set of four identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong with an additional tile to make a complete set of four. There are three ways to form a Kong.\n:# ''Concealed Kong'' \u2013 If a player holds three matching tiles (concealed Pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four they may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing two pieces in the middle face up and two pieces on the ends face down.\n:# ''Exposed Kong'' \u2013 If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed Pong) in their hand, he can take the piece and reveal an \"exposed kong\" or \"melded kong\". The player reveals his three pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile, or face down next to the three other face up pieces.\n:# ''Exposed Kong from Exposed Pong'' \u2013 If a player already has a melded Pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, he may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it, it must be drawn.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The fourth piece of a Kong is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. A Kong may not be formed from Bonus tiles (Flowers/Seasons), since the set does not include four identical tiles. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and deprive opponents of the opportunity to obtain specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence and all in the same suit. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. Honors tiles cannot be used to make Chows because they have no numerical value, and Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons) also cannot be used to make a Chow.\n\nA player can steal a discard to form a Chow only from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs; however, a player forming a Chow from a seized piece has the lowest priority for that tile. Any other player who needs that tile to make a Pong, make a Kong, or to win may seize that piece instead. Like the Pong, the Chow is either concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing the prior player's discard).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are two identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''. North Clarendon, VT: [[Tuttle Publishing|Tuttle]], p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-3302-8}}.</ref>\n\nFor example:\n\n[[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]] [[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]]\n\n[[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]]\n\n==== Interruption of play ====\nThe regular anti-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:\n\n===== 1. Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, he may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== 2. Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\n\nWhen a meld (''Pong'', ''Kong,'' or ''Chow'') is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues anti-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\n\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n\n* # Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n* # Next priority goes to the player who declares a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' using the discard. A player who calls for a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a Mahjong set.\n\n* # Last priority goes to the player who declares a Chow using the discard. Players may only call for a ''Chow'' from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand.\n\n===== 3. Going Mahjong =====\n''Going Mahjong'' is the act of declaring a winning hand, either by stealing a discard or by drawing a winning tile.\n\n======From a discard======\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they yell out 'Mahjong!', take the discard and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to go mahjong (win the hand) there are two ways to resolve the issue depending on agreed table rules: Either the players count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, or the winner is simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn.\n\n======From the wall======\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\n\n===== 4. Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (either by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to go Mahjong (win the hand) and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the Kong.\n\n==== Examples of winning hands ====\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (Pongs, Kongs, or Chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n: [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n''Hand formed with four Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind. Only bamboo is used (no other simples), scoring extra points (clean hand). No chows are used (an all Pong/Kong hand scores extra points).''\n\n: [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt2-.svg|25px|2 Circle]] [[File:MJt3-.svg|25px|3 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]] [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]]\n''A high-scoring hand formed using only circles, known as a pure hand. Hand is made of Chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''seven different pairs'' and ''13 orphans'' are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n====False Mahjong====\nCalling out Mahjong! without having a complete (legal) hand or without the minimum points is usually penalized depending on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false mahjong must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand).\n\n==== Repeated hands ====\n\nIf the dealer wins the hand, he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\n\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a \"goulash hand\". Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\n\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum faan points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts all of his or her faan points.\n* faan points depend on:\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum faan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum faan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. in a three faan minimum game, if a player has two faan points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another faan point before calling mahjong. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins\n* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added his or her points (faan points plus bonus points) they must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"chips or points\") based on three factors:\n** the base points (faan points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer (doubles the points)\n\n==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand====\n\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another players discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong doesn't award concealed melds/hands as generously as others. Concealed hands only the case with a few limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pongs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and over several melds (three concealed pongs).\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|+Meld summary\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Meld Type !! rowspan=2 | Quantity !! colspan=3 | Eligible tiles !! colspan=2 | When completed by ...\n|-\n!

Some examples of scoring include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sample faan scoring\n! Type !!

How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see [[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Base points (Old Hong Kong Simplified) \n! faan points !!  Base points\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 3 || 1 \n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 4 || rowspan=3 | 2\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 5\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 6\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 7 || rowspan=3 | 4\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 8\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 9\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3\"\n| 10+ || 8 (limit)\n|}\n\nThis table is based on play where 3 faan is the minimum needed in order to win with a legal hand. If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\n* If the winner wins from the wall his base points are doubled\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east all losers double the basepoints\n* If east player is a losing player he pays double the points to the winner.\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, he must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n!Hand !!

These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winners hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to go mahjong). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate if the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four Flowers and all four Seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\nIn all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (Maximum number of fan agreed)\n! width=10% | Hand !! width=90% | Explanation with example\n|-\n!

It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia. All players score and it is possible to score higher than the winner.\n* '''Hong Kong Mahjong''' or '''Cantonese Mahjong''' is a more common form of Mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi ({{lang|zh|\u8d56\u5b50}}), and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, and is called {{lang|zh|\u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760}}. Special tiles need to be discarded.\n* '''Changsha Mahjong''' is widely played in [[Hunan]] Province. Like Wuhan Mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha Mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.\n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which allegedly might be said in some regard to perhaps match the personality of north-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or nine in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''Taiwanese Mahjong''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''Filipino Mahjong''', sixteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. Honors are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Taiyuan Lisi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; {{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]}}), the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong]]''' are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements of Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kong'') are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different to most other variations.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''' has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Vietnamese Mahjong''' has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. Modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.\n* '''Japanese classical Mahjong''' is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores. \n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.<!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http://gamenoodle.blogspot.com/2012/09/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]</ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http://www.mahjongnews.com/en/index.php/ec-riichi/54-ec-2008/104-rmc2008.html]</ref>-->\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:korean-overview|title=Korean Mahjong Rules - Mahjong Wiki (\u9ebb\u5c06\u7ef4\u57fa)|website=mahjong.wikidot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amja.net/|title=The American Mah-Jongg Association \u2013 news, products and tournaments \u2013 Join us for our next American Mah-Jongg tournament or cruise!.}}</ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as Honors, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Legal hands are changed annually. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n\n'''[[Three player mahjong|Three-player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2\u20138 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.<ref>The Mahjong Wiki.[http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:three-player Three-player mahjong]. Retrieved 17 November 2017.</ref>\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\n==== Tables ====\n[[File:Open the mah-jong table (3599421021).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of an automatic mahjong table.]]\nMahjong tables are square and small enough to be within arm's length of all equipment. The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It prepares one wall while the players play one hand. After the hand is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and a new wall raises upwards. In theory the table should avoid cheating (by stacking the deck and or using loaded dice).\n\n====Tiles====\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=11|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!colspan=2|8\n!colspan=2|9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Suits\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=4|Honors/Bonus\n!colspan=4|Winds\n!colspan=3|Dragons\n!colspan=4|Bonus\n|-\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n!colspan=2|Seasons\n!colspan=2|Flowers\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJh1-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh2-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh5-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh6-.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|[[File:MJh3-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh4-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh7-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh8-.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no Honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\n\n==== Wild cards and jokers ====\n\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles can't be discarded and can only replace tiles in Chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\n\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\n[[File:Joker-vietnammj.JPG|right|thumb|Top eight are Vietnamese jokers. Bottom four are Chinese.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Wild card tile chosen !! Another wildcard\n|-\n| East || South\n|-\n| South || West\n|-\n| West || North\n|-\n| North || East\n|-\n| Red Dragon || Green Dragon\n|-\n| Green Dragon || White Dragon\n|-\n| White Dragon || Red Dragon\n|}\n\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\n\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n===== Flowers =====\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and three-player Mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\nFour of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|four noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5-.svg|50px|Plum]] [[File:MJh6-.svg|50px|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7-.svg|50px|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8-.svg|50px|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1-.svg|50px|Spring]] [[File:MJh2-.svg|50px|Summer]] [[File:MJh3-.svg|50px|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4-.svg|50px|Winter]]\n\nThese animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[rooster]] and [[centipede]]. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\n\n[[File:MJat1-.svg|50px|Cat]] [[File:MJat2-.svg|50px|Mouse]] [[File:MJat3-.svg|50px|Rooster]] [[File:MJat4-.svg|50px|Centipede]]\n\n===== Walls =====\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====\n[[File:Mahjong fiches.jpg|thumb|right|Mahjong counting sticks: Left are Chinese while the right are Japanese]]\nDepending on the variation, two or three [[dice]] are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\n\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\n\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), [[jeton]]s, [[play money]], paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\n\n==== Charleston ====\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Hands ===\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n==== Ready hands ====\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''13 orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|r\u012bchi|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|dora|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalised in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese \u6d41\u5c40 ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n==== Abortive draws ====\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e5d\u724c|Ky\u016bshu Ky\u016bhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|last=Gregory |first=Peter |url=http://mahjongbritishrules.com/scoring/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6-.svg|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1-.svg|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3-.svg|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo|Four Winds' barrier|\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u4eba\u7acb\u76f4|Yonin r\u012bchi}}: If all four players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo|Four Kongs' abort|\u56db\u69d3\u6563\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the fourth Kong is declared, unless all four Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n====Points====\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his hand is scored by adding his points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mahjong Variations\n!

The game is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. A two player version was published by [[Nintendo]]. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002. Left: John J. O'Connor (2nd place) In the middle: world champion Mai Hatsune, from Japan Right: Yuichi Ikeya (3rd place)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the [[2002 World Championship in Mahjong|first global tournament in Mahjong]] was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first [[Open European Mahjong Championship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |accessdate=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145919/http://mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players.

There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first [[World Mahjong Championship]] in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nOther major international tournaments include the [[Mahjong International League]]'s [[World Mahjong Sports Games]] and the privately sponsored [[World Series Of Mahjong]].\n\n[[American mahjong]] tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM). MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title='China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong'.

Each deck is divided into three suits of '''[[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]]''' or coins, '''[[String of cash coins (currency unit)|Strings]]''' of cash, and '''[[Myriad]]s''' of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]]. [[Khanhoo]] is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' ([[:zh:\u78b0\u548c|\u78b0\u548c]]) which was played with 120 or 150 cards.<ref name=Lo/> During the late 19th century, ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' was used interchangeably with ''m\u00e1qu\u00e8'' in both card and tile form.\n\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo/><ref name=\"Stanwick1\">{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162|ref=Stanwick1}}</ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.</ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game'', written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''</ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a Jewish remake,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] before it went bankrupt and closed on October 10, 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\n[[File:Schoolkidsmahjong.jpg|thumb|200px|Students in the United States learning how to play Mahjong]]\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.</ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.</ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga!

{"title_page": "John Lambert of Creg Clare", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n'''John Lambert of Creg Clare''' ([[fl.]] c.1610 \u2013 c.1669) was an Irish soldier and [[Royalist]].\n\n==Life==\n\nA native of [[County Galway]] a Hiberno-Norman, Lambert is described as \"an officer in Lord Clanricarde's Regiment in the Duke of Ormonde's Army in Ireland 1645. Had a lease of Creg Clare from the [[Earl of Clanricarde]] in 1669.\" (O'Regan, p.&nbsp;40)\n\nAccording to Patrick Melvin (p.&nbsp;53), the original Lambert residence, Creg Clare, is north-east of [[Ardrahan]], close to Castle Taylor, Tullira and Roxborough, homes of the Taylor, [[Martyn (surname)|Martyn]] and Persse families by the early 18th-century.\n\nDonovan O'Sullivan more fully describes him as the secretary of [[Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde]] in November 1651. In that month, Clanricarde \"dispatched his secretary, John Lambert, to Galway to find out exactly the real state of feeling in the town. Lambert's instructions were to put the inhabitants fully ''au courant'' with the situation in the kingdom. Having done this, he was to inform them that, since the Jamestown meeting had not been possible, the [[Lord Deputy]] now proposed that a Council of [[prelate]]s, [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] should be held at Galway or some place near it to review the whole position, consider the possibility of foreign aids, and decide whether Clanricarde could be of any further use to the country;\" (pp.&nbsp;314\u2013315). Donovan O'Sullivan reports that \"The mayor and Council of Galway seem to have been impressed with Lambert's statement.\"\n\n==Family==\n\nHe married twice; firstly in 1649 to Redish, daughter of Thomas Lynch, [[Mayor of Galway]] by whom he had;\n\n* Mary Lambert, who married Robert French of Rahasane, Co. Galway.\n* Joseph Lambert, whose descendants settled in [[County Mayo]].\n\nRedish Lynch died in the 1650s. Lambert married secondly, on 23 June 1659, Mary Ffrench, who may have been brother to Robert Ffrench of Rahasane, and dau of Marcus Ffrench of Cahir Dangin and wife Catherine D'arcy. Redish and John Lambert had a son;\n\n* Charles Lambert, ancestor of subsequent Lambert families of County Galway, born c.1660, killed at the Siege of Derry, 1689.\n\n==Disputed ancestry==\n\nJohn Lambert has been associated with [[Major-General]] [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] (1619\u20131684), claiming descent from his father, Josias of Carlton, Yorkshire (born 1554). However, there is in fact nothing to demonstrate any relationship between the two, beyond the accident of sharing a name. He may instead have been a kinsman of [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nWriting in 1820, [[James Hardiman]] included the Lamberts among the \"many other families, who ... were equally ancient and respectable, as well from length of residence in the town, as through alliance with the other inhabitants, by whom they were gradually affiliated, and finally considered, without any distinction, as members of the same body\" (p.&nbsp;20) as the [[Tribes of Galway]], the premier families of Galway town in the early 1600s.\n\n==Descendants==\n\nMelvin remarks that Lambert's \"original seat in the county was Cregclare near Ardrahan. Further branches of the family became established at Castle Ellen and Castle Lambert\" (located some four miles west and north of [[Athenry]], respectively) \"on property acquired from the Blakes and Brownes. The earlier name of Castle Lambert was Aghrim and it was part of the estate of the Blakes of Corbally, which was the original name of Castle Daly.\"\n\nNotable descendants of John Lambert would include:\n\n* [[Charles Lambert of Creg Clare]], [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], killed at the 1689 siege of [[Derry]]\n* Sarah Lambert, Lady Clanmorris, wife of [[Charles Barry Bingham, 2nd Baron Clanmorris]] (married 1816)\n* John Walter Henry Lambert of Aggard, [[Craughwell]], J.P., [[High Sheriff of County Galway]],1855 (1811\u201399)\n* Captain [[Thomas Eyre Lambert]], [[landlord]] and assassin target (1819\u20131920)\n* [[Isabella Lambert Carson]] (born 1823)\n* [[James Staunton Lambert]] of Creg Clare, M.P. for Galway (1826\u201333)\n* Ada Constance Lambert, wife of [[Sir George Moyers]], [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]],1881.\n* [[Nannie Lambert Power O'Donoghue]], equestrian, journalist and novelist (1843\u20131940)\n* [[Edward Henry Carson, Baron Carson]] PC, Pc (Ire), Kt., QC, (1854\u20131935)\n* [[Edward Martyn]], co-founder of The [[Abbey Theatre]], (1859\u20131924)\n* [[Walter Peter Lambert]], Lt.

Had a lease of Creg Clare from the [[Earl of Clanricarde]] in 1669.\" (O'Regan, p.&nbsp;40)\n\nAccording to Patrick Melvin (p.&nbsp;53), the original Lambert residence, Creg Clare, is north-east of [[Ardrahan]], close to Castle Taylor, Tullira and Roxborough, homes of the Taylor, [[Martyn (surname)|Martyn]] and Persse families by the early 18th-century.\n\nDonovan O'Sullivan more fully describes him as the secretary of [[Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde]] in November 1651. In that month, Clanricarde \"dispatched his secretary, John Lambert, to Galway to find out exactly the real state of feeling in the town. Lambert's instructions were to put the inhabitants fully ''au courant'' with the situation in the kingdom. Having done this, he was to inform them that, since the Jamestown meeting had not been possible, the [[Lord Deputy]] now proposed that a Council of [[prelate]]s, [[nobility]] and [[gentry]] should be held at Galway or some place near it to review the whole position, consider the possibility of foreign aids, and decide whether Clanricarde could be of any further use to the country;\" (pp.&nbsp;314\u2013315). Donovan O'Sullivan reports that \"The mayor and Council of Galway seem to have been impressed with Lambert's statement.\"\n\n==Family==\n\nHe married twice; firstly in 1649 to Redish, daughter of Thomas Lynch, [[Mayor of Galway]] by whom he had;\n\n* Mary Lambert, who married Robert French of Rahasane, Co. Galway.\n* Joseph Lambert, whose descendants settled in [[County Mayo]].\n\nRedish Lynch died in the 1650s. Lambert married secondly, on 23 June 1659, Mary Ffrench, who may have been brother to Robert Ffrench of Rahasane, and dau of Marcus Ffrench of Cahir Dangin and wife Catherine D'arcy. Redish and John Lambert had a son;\n\n* Charles Lambert, ancestor of subsequent Lambert families of County Galway, born c.1660, killed at the Siege of Derry, 1689.\n\n==Disputed ancestry==\n\nJohn Lambert has been associated with [[Major-General]] [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] (1619\u20131684), claiming descent from his father, Josias of Carlton, Yorkshire (born 1554). However, there is in fact nothing to demonstrate any relationship between the two, beyond the accident of sharing a name. He may instead have been a kinsman of [[Charles Lambart, 1st Earl of Cavan]].\n\nWriting in 1820, [[James Hardiman]] included the Lamberts among the \"many other families, who ... were equally ancient and respectable, as well from length of residence in the town, as through alliance with the other inhabitants, by whom they were gradually affiliated, and finally considered, without any distinction, as members of the same body\" (p.&nbsp;20) as the [[Tribes of Galway]], the premier families of Galway town in the early 1600s.\n\n==Descendants==\n\nMelvin remarks that Lambert's \"original seat in the county was Cregclare near Ardrahan. Further branches of the family became established at Castle Ellen and Castle Lambert\" (located some four miles west and north of [[Athenry]], respectively) \"on property acquired from the Blakes and Brownes. The earlier name of Castle Lambert was Aghrim and it was part of the estate of the Blakes of Corbally, which was the original name of Castle Daly.\"\n\nNotable descendants of John Lambert would include:\n\n* [[Charles Lambert of Creg Clare]], [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], killed at the 1689 siege of [[Derry]]\n* Sarah Lambert, Lady Clanmorris, wife of [[Charles Barry Bingham, 2nd Baron Clanmorris]] (married 1816)\n* John Walter Henry Lambert of Aggard, [[Craughwell]], J.P., [[High Sheriff of County Galway]],1855 (1811\u201399)\n* Captain [[Thomas Eyre Lambert]], [[landlord]] and assassin target (1819\u20131920)\n* [[Isabella Lambert Carson]] (born 1823)\n* [[James Staunton Lambert]] of Creg Clare, M.P. for Galway (1826\u201333)\n* Ada Constance Lambert, wife of [[Sir George Moyers]], [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]],1881.\n* [[Nannie Lambert Power O'Donoghue]], equestrian, journalist and novelist (1843\u20131940)\n* [[Edward Henry Carson, Baron Carson]] PC, Pc (Ire), Kt., QC, (1854\u20131935)\n* [[Edward Martyn]], co-founder of The [[Abbey Theatre]], (1859\u20131924)\n* [[Walter Peter Lambert]], Lt.

''who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity.'' James the brother of Jesus, and Paul of Tarsus, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank.

This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]]. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Holy Orders|website=www.va|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of [[prime minister]], which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp|title=Dr Scott Hahn on the Papacy {{!}} Catholic-Pages.com|website=www.catholic-pages.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/apologetics/catholic-doctrines-and-practices/st-peter-and-the-popes|title=St. Peter and the Popes|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.  Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present.  Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M.

In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|Christianity of the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way \u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his ''Scorpiace'' of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold. \u2026For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> ''Scorpiace'' is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\", rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD ''De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate'', Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the Church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. He called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126.</ref> His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\n[[Saint Augustine]] was born in [[Numidia]] in 354 AD and was baptized in [[Milan]] in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163.</ref> His ''Sermo'' states, \"Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said 'I give to thee the keys \u2026 shall be loosed in heaven'. What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175.</ref> His 395 A.D. ''Contra Epistolam Manichaei'' states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church. \u2026The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Pope Innocent I====\n[[Pope Innocent I|Innocent I]] held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of papal primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes to the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted to but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter. \u2026So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles.\" The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 280, 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's ''Dictus Pape'' outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\"<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD). Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops.

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the De unitate ecclesia of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter... There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and - in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West:\n\n[[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years.

The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses.

Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank.

This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Protestants do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic suggests that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]]. Furthermore, it is typically the local bishop who is considered the high priest of his flock, rather than the pope alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Holy Orders|website=www.va|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence. In receiving the keys, Peter takes on the office of [[prime minister]], which was well-known to ancient and contemporary Hebrews, and depicted in the Old Testament, as the one who had authority from the King to bind and loose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/hahn.asp|title=Dr Scott Hahn on the Papacy {{!}} Catholic-Pages.com|website=www.catholic-pages.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resources/apologetics/catholic-doctrines-and-practices/st-peter-and-the-popes|title=St. Peter and the Popes|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.  Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present.  Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M.

His mission will be to keep this faith from every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1D.HTM#-F1 |title=Cathecism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=2012-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623214259/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1D.HTM#-F1 |archivedate=2012-06-23 }}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nRegarding the Catholic interpretation of Matthew 16:18-19, [[Jaroslav Pelikan]] writes:<ref>{{cite book |last= Pelikan |first= Jaroslav |authorlink= Jaroslav Pelikan |editor= |others= |title= The Riddle of Roman Catholicism |year= 1959 |publisher= Abingdon Press |location= New York |page= 78}}</ref> \"As Roman Catholic scholars now concede, the ancient Christian father Cyprian used it to prove the authority of the bishop\u2014not merely of the Roman bishop, but of every bishop,\" referring to Maurice Bevenot's work on St. Cyprian.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bevenot |first= Maurice | title= St. Cyprian: The Lapsed, The Unity of the Catholic Church |pages= 6\u20138}}</ref>\n\n[[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] agree with the above, but also consider Peter to be representative of all bishops. In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|Christianity of the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way \u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his Scorpiace of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold\u2026 For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> Scorpiace is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\" rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

Published online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.viii.xxi.html</ref> listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate, Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. St. Chrysostom called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ\u2026\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126.</ref> His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\n[[Saint Augustine]] was born in [[Numidia]] in 354 AD and was baptized in [[Milan]] in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163.</ref> His Sermo states, \"For Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said \"I give to thee the keys\u2026 shall be loosed in heaven\". What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175.</ref> His 395 A.D. Contra Epistolam Manichaei states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church\u2026 The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Pope Innocent I====\n[[Pope Innocent I|Innocent I]] held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of Papal Primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of Primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter\u2026 So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles\" (Giles, 280). The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's Dictus Pape outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\" <ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine Primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD). Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, The Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the Pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F. Donald.  A History of the Church in the Middle Ages.  New York: Routledge, 2002. p. 133.</ref> The papacy's most widely known crisis, as well as its largest challenge to authority, came with the \"[[Western Schism]]\" in the late Middle Ages, dating from 1378\u20131417.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\". Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director,\" or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al.

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the De unitate ecclesia of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter... There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and - in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West:\n\n[[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years.

However, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that [[Pope Linus|St. Linus]], not Peter, was actually the first [[Bishop of Rome]].\n{{quote|Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.<ref>\u2019\u2019Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions\u2019\u2019, Book 7, Chapter XLVI \u2013 \"Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?\"</ref>}}\n\n===''Keys'' and ''rock'' not exclusive to Peter===\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians agree that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}, \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 47\u201348}}</ref> However {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:18}} implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers.

In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches,\" and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that the accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ... The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses. The Greek makes the distinction between ''petros'' and ''petra'' simply because it is trying to preserve the pun, and in Greek the feminine ''petra'' could not very well serve as a masculine name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |title=Who is the Rock? |publisher=Users.stargate.net |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055823/http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAn alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \"upon this rock\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|32:3-4}}, which states that \"God...is the Rock, his work is perfect\".

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such.
