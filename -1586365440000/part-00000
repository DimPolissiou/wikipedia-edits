The facility also has an adjacent satellite prison camp housing minimum-security female offenders.\n\nFCI Dublin is located 20 miles southeast of [[Oakland]] on the [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/dub/index.jsp |title=BOP: FCI Dublin |publisher=Bop.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> It is located near [[Santa Rita Jail]], which is operated by [[Alameda County]].\n\n==History==\nFCI Dublin opened in 1974. It became an exclusively female prison in 2012 and is one of only five federal prisons for women in the United States (Aliceville, AL, Tallahassee, FL and Waseca, MN and Alderson, WV.).\n\n==Facility and programs==\nThe prison's education department offers [[GED]] and [[English language learning and teaching|ESL]] programs, as well as courses in parenting skills. The prison also provides legal and leisure library services in addition to training in the use of various computer [[software]].\n\nThere are two Federal Prison Industries [[UNICOR]] programs at FCI Dublin: the Textiles and the [[Call Center]]. Textiles employ approximately 150 inmates on the manufacture of custom draperies, [[parachute]]s, and disaster blankets. They also sort and repair [[USPS]] mailbags. The Call Center employs around 250 inmates on directory assistance inquiries.\n\nIt houses inmates who are serving an average sentence of 5 years. It has a design capacity of 250 inmates, but houses 1,077 as of April 11, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/locations/weekly_report.jsp |title=BOP: Weekly Population Report |publisher=Bop.gov |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> Conditions are cramped, with three inmates sharing a [[Prison cell|cell]] on the top tier and four inmates sharing a cell on the bottom tier, designed to house a single prisoner. Meals are served in shifts due to the small size of the dining facilities.\n\nLike most American prisons, FCI Dublin also contains a SHU (Security Housing Unit), where any prisoners who are deemed to have broken prison rules are kept in segregation under a highly restrictive regime. Prisoners in the SHU spend more time locked in their cell than the general prison population, are only allowed out for limited amounts of time and must be transported to and from their cell wearing [[handcuffs]]. Depending on the circumstances{{clarify|date=April 2013}}, an inmate may spend weeks or even months in the SHU.\n\nFCI Dublin is surrounded by two separate fences with a gap of approximately {{convert|10|ft|m}} between them. Measuring {{convert|14|ft|m}} high, each [[chain-link fence]] is reinforced with multiple coils of [[razor wire]] (at the top and bottom) plus electronic sensors to detect escape attempts.\n\nThe institution also has an adjacent administrative detention facility housing adult males on holdover or pre-trial status, and a minimum-security satellite camp housing adult female offenders, which opened in 1990. This minimum- security was several old army barracks and these have been torn down. The BOP has removed a section of the FCI and placed approximately 200 female minimum security prisoner in this space. This facility is just short of a FCI. All the guards are rotated out of the FCI.\n\n==Notable incidents==\nOn November 5, 1986, Ronald McIntosh, who had escaped during a prison transfer one month earlier, landed a stolen helicopter in the exercise yard and escaped with Samantha Lopez, who was serving a 50-year sentence for [[bank robbery]]. Mr. McIntosh was serving a sentence for [[wire fraud]] when he met Ms. Lopez working in the business office of the prison and the two devised the escape plan. They were arrested by FBI Agents 10 days later and subsequently convicted of air piracy and escape. McIntosh received a 25-year sentence and Lopez had five years added to her sentence.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/20/us/prison-couple-found-guilty-in-trial-on-helicopter-escape.html |title=Prison Couple Found Guilty In Trial On Helicopter Escape - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1987-05-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/19/us/lovers-sentenced-in-escape-from-prison-in-a-helicopter.html |title=Lovers Sentenced in Escape From Prison in a Helicopter - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1987-07-19 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Notable inmates==\n\u2020Inmates incarcerated prior to 1982 do not have an assigned register number.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=13%|Inmate Name\n!width=9%|Register Number\n!width=21%|Status\n!width=57%|Details\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Patricia Hearst]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| N/A\u2020\n| Released from custody in 1979 after President [[Jimmy Carter]] commuted her 7-year sentence; served 21 months.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Michael|title=New Focus on Old SLA Killing / Sara Jane Olson case revives interest in deadly bank robbery|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/New-Focus-on-Old-SLA-Killing-Sara-Jane-Olson-2960937.php|accessdate=23 October 2015|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|date=January 23, 2001}}</ref>\n| Granddaughter of publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]]; convicted in 1976 of participating in a 1974 bank robbery with members of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], who had kidnapped her several months before; pardoned in 2001 by President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Patty-Hearst-returns-to-prison-in-Pleasanton-2616604.php |title=Patty Hearst returns to prison in Pleasanton |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Rita Lavelle]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&needingMoreList=false&IDType=IRN&IDNumber=29753-112&x=83&y=7 29753-112]\n| Released from custody in 1985 after serving four and a half months of a six-month sentence.<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-09-05-8502280155-story.html</ref>\n| Assistant Administrator of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] for solid waste and emergency response under President [[Ronald Reagan]]; convicted in 1984 for [[perjury]] after an investigation of the [[Superfund]] program.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/us/rita-lavelle-gets-6-month-term-and-is-fined-10000-for-perjury.html</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Michael Milken]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&needingMoreList=false&IDType=IRN&IDNumber=16126-054&x=83&y=7 16126-054]\n| Released from custody in 1993 after serving 22 months of a 10-year sentence (later reduced to two years).<ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-milken-life-story-2017-5</ref>\n| American billionaire financier who created [[high-yield bonds]]; convicted of [[securities fraud]] in 1990.

The facility also has an adjacent satellite prison camp housing minimum-security female offenders.\n\nFCI Dublin is located 20 miles southeast of [[Oakland]] on the [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/dub/index.jsp |title=BOP: FCI Dublin |publisher=Bop.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> It is located near [[Santa Rita Jail]], which is operated by [[Alameda County]].\n\n==History==\nFCI Dublin opened in 1974. It became an exclusively female prison in 2012 and is one of only five federal prisons for women in the United States (Aliceville, AL, Tallahassee, FL and Waseca, MN and Alderson, WV.).\n\n==Facility and programs==\nThe prison's education department offers [[GED]] and [[English language learning and teaching|ESL]] programs, as well as courses in parenting skills. The prison also provides legal and leisure library services in addition to training in the use of various computer [[software]].\n\nThere are two Federal Prison Industries [[UNICOR]] programs at FCI Dublin: the Textiles and the [[Call Center]]. Textiles employ approximately 150 inmates on the manufacture of custom draperies, [[parachute]]s, and disaster blankets. They also sort and repair [[USPS]] mailbags. The Call Center employs around 250 inmates on directory assistance inquiries.\n\nIt houses inmates who are serving an average sentence of 5 years. It has a design capacity of 250 inmates, but houses 1,077 as of April 11, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/locations/weekly_report.jsp |title=BOP: Weekly Population Report |publisher=Bop.gov |date=2013-10-10 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> Conditions are cramped, with three inmates sharing a [[Prison cell|cell]] on the top tier and four inmates sharing a cell on the bottom tier, designed to house a single prisoner. Meals are served in shifts due to the small size of the dining facilities.\n\nLike most American prisons, FCI Dublin also contains a SHU (Security Housing Unit), where any prisoners who are deemed to have broken prison rules are kept in segregation under a highly restrictive regime. Prisoners in the SHU spend more time locked in their cell than the general prison population, are only allowed out for limited amounts of time and must be transported to and from their cell wearing [[handcuffs]]. Depending on the circumstances{{clarify|date=April 2013}}, an inmate may spend weeks or even months in the SHU.\n\nFCI Dublin is surrounded by two separate fences with a gap of approximately {{convert|10|ft|m}} between them. Measuring {{convert|14|ft|m}} high, each [[chain-link fence]] is reinforced with multiple coils of [[razor wire]] (at the top and bottom) plus electronic sensors to detect escape attempts.\n\nThe institution also has an adjacent administrative detention facility housing adult males on holdover or pre-trial status, and a minimum-security satellite camp housing adult female offenders, which opened in 1990. This minimum- security was several old army barracks and these have been torn down. The BOP has removed a section of the FCI and placed approximately 200 female minimum security prisoner in this space. This facility is just short of a FCI. All the guards are rotated out of the FCI.\n\n==Notable incidents==\nOn November 5, 1986, Ronald McIntosh, who had escaped during a prison transfer one month earlier, landed a stolen helicopter in the exercise yard and escaped with Samantha Lopez, who was serving a 50-year sentence for [[bank robbery]]. Mr. McIntosh was serving a sentence for [[wire fraud]] when he met Ms. Lopez working in the business office of the prison and the two devised the escape plan. They were arrested by FBI Agents 10 days later and subsequently convicted of air piracy and escape. McIntosh received a 25-year sentence and Lopez had five years added to her sentence.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/20/us/prison-couple-found-guilty-in-trial-on-helicopter-escape.html |title=Prison Couple Found Guilty In Trial On Helicopter Escape - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1987-05-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/19/us/lovers-sentenced-in-escape-from-prison-in-a-helicopter.html |title=Lovers Sentenced in Escape From Prison in a Helicopter - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1987-07-19 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Notable inmates==\n\u2020Inmates incarcerated prior to 1982 do not have an assigned register number.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=13%|Inmate Name\n!width=9%|Register Number\n!width=21%|Status\n!width=57%|Details\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Patricia Hearst]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| N/A\u2020\n| Released from custody in 1979 after President [[Jimmy Carter]] commuted her 7-year sentence; served 21 months.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Michael|title=New Focus on Old SLA Killing / Sara Jane Olson case revives interest in deadly bank robbery|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/New-Focus-on-Old-SLA-Killing-Sara-Jane-Olson-2960937.php|accessdate=23 October 2015|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|date=January 23, 2001}}</ref>\n| Granddaughter of publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]]; convicted in 1976 of participating in a 1974 bank robbery with members of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]], who had kidnapped her several months before; pardoned in 2001 by President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Patty-Hearst-returns-to-prison-in-Pleasanton-2616604.php |title=Patty Hearst returns to prison in Pleasanton |publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|date=2003-05-16 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Rita Lavelle]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&needingMoreList=false&IDType=IRN&IDNumber=29753-112&x=83&y=7 29753-112]\n| Released from custody in 1985 after serving four and a half months of a six-month sentence.<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-09-05-8502280155-story.html</ref>\n| Assistant Administrator of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] for solid waste and emergency response under President [[Ronald Reagan]]; convicted in 1984 for [[perjury]] after an investigation of the [[Superfund]] program.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/10/us/rita-lavelle-gets-6-month-term-and-is-fined-10000-for-perjury.html</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Michael Milken]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=IDSearch&needingMoreList=false&IDType=IRN&IDNumber=16126-054&x=83&y=7 16126-054]\n| Released from custody in 1993 after serving 22 months of a 10-year sentence (later reduced to two years).<ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-milken-life-story-2017-5</ref>\n| American billionaire financier who created [[high-yield bonds]]; convicted of [[securities fraud]] in 1990.

This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups; and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation. They therefore reject approaches that they believe will prevent this, such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as well as \"views that dismiss activity in the unions\" or that dismiss anti-imperialist movements.<ref name=\"Anarkismo statement\">Anarkismo, 2012, [http://www.anarkismo.net/about_us \"About Us\"].

The group, which consisted of exiled [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchist]] veterans of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] (notably [[Nestor Makhno]] who played a leading role in the anarchist revolution in Ukraine of 1918&ndash;1921),  based the ''Platform'' on their experiences of the revolution and the eventual victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] outside Ukraine. The document drew praise and criticism from anarchists worldwide and sparked a major debate within the anarchist movement.<ref name=\"Black Flame\">Schmidt, M. and [[Lucien van der Walt|van der Walt, L.]] 2009.

However, it is not a formal \"international\" and has no intention of competing with these other formations.\n\n==Organisational ideas==\nThe ''Platform'' describes four key organisational features which distinguish platformism:\n*'''Tactical unity''' \u2014 \"A common tactical line in the movement is of decisive importance for the existence of the organisation and the whole movement: it avoids the disastrous effect of several tactics opposing each other; it concentrates the forces of the movement; and gives them a common direction leading to a fixed objective\".<ref>From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>\n*'''Theoretical unity''' \u2014 \"Theory represents the force which directs the activity of persons and organisations along a defined path towards a determined goal. Naturally it should be common to all the persons and organisations adhering to the General Union. All activity by the General Union, both overall and in its details, should be in perfect concord with the theoretical principles professed by the union\".<ref>From section on theoretical unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>\n*'''Collective Responsibility''' \u2014 \"The practice of acting on one's personal responsibility should be decisively condemned and rejected in the ranks of the anarchist movement. The areas of revolutionary life, social and political, are above all profoundly collective by nature. Social revolutionary activity in these areas cannot be based on the personal responsibility of individual militants\".<ref>From section on Collective responsibility in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>\n*'''Federalism''' \u2014 \"Against centralism, anarchism has always professed and defended the principle of federalism, which reconciles the independence and initiative of individuals and the organisation with service to the common cause\".<ref>All sourced from the [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm From section Federalism within the Organizational Section of the original document]</ref>\n\nThe ''Platform'' argues that \"[w]e have vital need of an organisation which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement\". In short, unity meant unity of ideas and actions as opposed to unity on the basis of the anarchist label.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)'' was written in 1926 by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, a group of exiled Russian and Ukrainian [[anarchists in France]] who published the ''Dielo Truda'' journal. The pamphlet is an analysis of basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society and recommendations as to how an anarchist organisation should be structured.\n\n==Antecedents of the ''Platform''==\nThe authors of the ''Platform'' insisted that its basic ideas were not new, but had a long anarchist pedigree. Platformism is not therefore a revision away from classical anarchism, or a new approach, but a \"restatement\" of existing positions.<ref name=\"Black Flame\"/>\n\nThey cited [[Peter Kropotkin]] arguing that \"the formation of an anarchist organisation in Russia, far from being prejudicial to the common revolutionary task, on the contrary it is desirable and useful to the very greatest degree\" and argued that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s \"aspirations concerning organisations, as well as his activity\" in the [[First International]], \"give us every right to view him as an active partisan of just such an organisation\". Indeed, \"practically all active anarchist militants fought against all dispersed activity, and desired an anarchist movement welded by unity of ends and means\".<ref>From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/introduction.htm The Platform]</ref>\n\n==Problems caused by poor translations==\nThe ''Platform'' used to be known in English as the ''Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists'', a result of its having been translated from the French edition popularized in the early 1970s. In his book ''Facing the Enemy: A history of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968'' (p.&nbsp;131), [[Alexandre Skirda]] attributes much of the controversy about the ''Platform'' to the original 1926 French translation made by its opponent [[Voline]]. Later translations to French have corrected some of the mistranslations and the latest English translation, made directly from the Russian original, reflects this.\n\n==Other terms==\nSome platformist organisations today are unhappy with the designation, often preferring to use descriptions such as \"anarchist communist\", \"social anarchist\", \"libertarian communist/socialist\" or even [[especifist]]. Most agree that the 1926 ''Platform'' was sorely lacking in certain areas and point out that it was a draft document, never intended to be adopted in its original form. The Italian [[Federation of Anarchist Communists]] (FdCA), for example, do not insist on the principle of \"tactical unity\", which according to them is impossible to achieve over a large area, preferring instead \"tactical homogeneity\".<ref>[http://www.fdca.it/fdcaen/organization/tesi.htm FdCA positions and theoretical documents], retrieved 2 January 2012</ref>\n\n==The ''Platform'' today==\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|Philosophies}}\nToday there are organisations inspired by the ''Platform'' in many countries, including:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!

This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups; and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation. They therefore reject approaches that they believe will prevent this, such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as well as \"views that dismiss activity in the unions\" or that dismiss anti-imperialist movements.<ref name=\"Anarkismo statement\">Anarkismo, 2012, [http://www.anarkismo.net/about_us \"About Us\"].

The group, which consisted of exiled [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchist]] veterans of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] (notably [[Nestor Makhno]] who played a leading role in the anarchist revolution in Ukraine of 1918&ndash;1921),  based the ''Platform'' on their experiences of the revolution and the eventual victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] outside Ukraine. The document drew praise and criticism from anarchists worldwide and sparked a major debate within the anarchist movement.<ref name=\"Black Flame\">Schmidt, M. and [[Lucien van der Walt|van der Walt, L.]] 2009.

However, it is not a formal \"international\" and has no intention of competing with these other formations.\n\n==Organisational ideas==\nThe ''Platform'' describes four key organisational features which distinguish platformism:\n*'''Tactical unity''' \u2014 \"A common tactical line in the movement is of decisive importance for the existence of the organisation and the whole movement: it avoids the disastrous effect of several tactics opposing each other; it concentrates the forces of the movement; and gives them a common direction leading to a fixed objective\".<ref>From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>\n*'''Theoretical unity''' \u2014 \"Theory represents the force which directs the activity of persons and organisations along a defined path towards a determined goal. Naturally it should be common to all the persons and organisations adhering to the General Union. All activity by the General Union, both overall and in its details, should be in perfect concord with the theoretical principles professed by the union\".<ref>From section on theoretical unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>\n*'''Collective Responsibility''' \u2014 \"The practice of acting on one's personal responsibility should be decisively condemned and rejected in the ranks of the anarchist movement. The areas of revolutionary life, social and political, are above all profoundly collective by nature. Social revolutionary activity in these areas cannot be based on the personal responsibility of individual militants\".<ref>From section on Collective responsibility in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>\n*'''Federalism''' \u2014 \"Against centralism, anarchism has always professed and defended the principle of federalism, which reconciles the independence and initiative of individuals and the organisation with service to the common cause\".<ref>All sourced from the [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm From section Federalism within the Organizational Section of the original document]</ref>\n\nThe ''Platform'' argues that \"[w]e have vital need of an organisation which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement\". In short, unity meant unity of ideas and actions as opposed to unity on the basis of the anarchist label.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)'' was written in 1926 by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, a group of exiled Russian and Ukrainian [[anarchists in France]] who published the ''Dielo Truda'' journal. The pamphlet is an analysis of basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society and recommendations as to how an anarchist organisation should be structured.\n\n==Antecedents of the ''Platform''==\nThe authors of the ''Platform'' insisted that its basic ideas were not new, but had a long anarchist pedigree. Platformism is not therefore a revision away from classical anarchism, or a new approach, but a \"restatement\" of existing positions.<ref name=\"Black Flame\"/>\n\nThey cited [[Peter Kropotkin]] arguing that \"the formation of an anarchist organisation in Russia, far from being prejudicial to the common revolutionary task, on the contrary it is desirable and useful to the very greatest degree\" and argued that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s \"aspirations concerning organisations, as well as his activity\" in the [[First International]], \"give us every right to view him as an active partisan of just such an organisation\". Indeed, \"practically all active anarchist militants fought against all dispersed activity, and desired an anarchist movement welded by unity of ends and means\".<ref>From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/introduction.htm The Platform]</ref>\n\n==Problems caused by poor translations==\nThe ''Platform'' used to be known in English as the ''Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists'', a result of its having been translated from the French edition popularized in the early 1970s. In his book ''Facing the Enemy: A history of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968'' (p.&nbsp;131), [[Alexandre Skirda]] attributes much of the controversy about the ''Platform'' to the original 1926 French translation made by its opponent [[Voline]]. Later translations to French have corrected some of the mistranslations and the latest English translation, made directly from the Russian original, reflects this.\n\n==Other terms==\nSome platformist organisations today are unhappy with the designation, often preferring to use descriptions such as \"anarchist communist\", \"social anarchist\", \"libertarian communist/socialist\" or even [[especifist]]. Most agree that the 1926 ''Platform'' was sorely lacking in certain areas and point out that it was a draft document, never intended to be adopted in its original form. The Italian [[Federation of Anarchist Communists]] (FdCA), for example, do not insist on the principle of \"tactical unity\", which according to them is impossible to achieve over a large area, preferring instead \"tactical homogeneity\".<ref>[http://www.fdca.it/fdcaen/organization/tesi.htm FdCA positions and theoretical documents], retrieved 2 January 2012</ref>\n\n==The ''Platform'' today==\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|Philosophies}}\nToday there are organisations inspired by the ''Platform'' in many countries, including:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!

Together with [[Jordanian Arabic]], it has the [[ISO 639-3]] language code \"ajp\", known as [[South Levantine Arabic]]. Further dialects can be distinguished within Palestine, such as spoken in the northern [[West Bank]], that spoken by Palestinians in the Hebron area, which is similar to Arabic spoken by descendants of Palestinian refugees living in Jordan and south-western Syria.\n\n== History ==\nThe variations between dialects probably reflect the different historical steps of [[Arabization]] of Palestine.\n\nPrior to their adoption of the Arabic language in the seventh century, the inhabitants of Palestine predominantly spoke [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Palestinian Aramaic]] (as witnessed, for example, in Palestinian Jewish and Palestinian Christian literature), as well as [[Greek language|Greek]] (probably in the upper or trader social classes), and some remaining traces of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. At that time in history, Arabic-speaking people living in the Negev desert or in the Jordan desert beyond Zarqa, Amman or Karak had no significant influence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nArabic-speaking people such as the Nabataeans tended to adopt Aramaic as a written language as shown in the [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean language]] texts of [[Petra]]. Jews and Nabataeans lived side by side in Mahoza and other villages, and their dialects of what they would both have thought of as \u201cAramaic\u201d would almost certainly have been mutually comprehensible. Additionally, occasional Arabic loan can be found in the Jewish Aramaic documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=Michael C. A.|title=How much can we know about language and literacy in Roman Judaea? A review|url=https://www.academia.edu/38960413|journal=Journal of Roman Archaeology|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[language shift|adoption of Arabic]] among the local population occurred most probably in several waves. After the Arabs took control of the area, so as to maintain their regular activity, the upper classes had quickly to get fluency in the language of the new masters who most probably were only few. The prevalence of Northern Levantine features in the urban dialects until the early 20th century, as well as in the dialect of [[Samaritans]] in Nablus (with systematic imala of /a:/) tends to show that a first layer of Arabization of urban upper classes could have led to what is now urban Levantine. Then, the main phenomenon could have been the slow countryside shift of Aramaic-speaking villages to Arabic under the influence of Arabized elites, leading to the emergence of the rural Palestinian dialects{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. This scenario is consistent with several facts.\n\n* The rural forms can be correlated with features also observed in the few Syrian villages where use of Aramaic has been retained up to this day. Palatalisation of /k/ (but of /t/ too), pronunciation [k\u02e4] of /q/  for instance. Note that the first also exists in [[Najdi Arabic]] and [[Gulf Arabic]], but limited to palatal contexts (/k/ followed by i or a). Moreover, those Eastern dialects have [g] or [d\u0292] for /q/ {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.\n* The less-evolutive urban forms can be explained by a limitation owed to the contacts urban trader classes had to maintain with Arabic speakers of other towns in Syria or Egypt.\n* The Negev Bedouins dialect shares a number of features with bedouin Hejazi dialects (unlike Urban Hejazi).\n\n== Differences compared to other Levantine Arabic dialects ==\n[[File:Manual of Palestinean Arabic, for self-instruction 1909.png|thumb|Manual of Palestinean Arabic, for self-instruction (1909)]]\nThe dialects spoken by the Arabs of the Levant \u2013 the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean \u2013 or [[Levantine Arabic]], form a group of dialects of Arabic. Arabic manuals for the \"Syrian dialect\" were produced in the early 20th century,<ref>Crow, F.E., ''Arabic manual: a colloquia handbook in the Syrian dialect, for the use of visitors to Syria and Palestine, containing a simplified grammar, a comprehensive English and Arabic vocabulary and dialogues'', Luzac & co, London, 1901</ref> and in 1909 a specific \"Palestinean Arabic\" manual was published.\n\nThe Palestinian Arabic dialects are varieties of Levantine Arabic because they display the following characteristic Levantine features.\n* A conservative stress pattern, closer to Classical Arabic than anywhere else in the Arab world.\n* The indicative imperfect with a b- prefix\n* A very frequent [[Im\u0101la]] of the feminine ending in front consonant context (names in -eh).\n* A [\u0294] realisation of /q/ in the cities, and a [q] realisation of /q/ by the Druzes{{dubious|date=December 2018}}, and more variants (including [k]) in the countryside.\n* A shared lexicon\n\nThe noticeable differences between southern and northern forms of Levantine Arabic, such as [[Syrian Arabic]] and [[Lebanese Arabic]], are stronger in non-urban dialects. The main differences between Palestinian and northern Levantine Arabic are as follows:\n\n* Phonetically, Palestinian dialects differ from Lebanese regarding the classical diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/, which have simplified to [e\u02d0] and [o:] in Palestinian dialects as in Western Syrian, while in Lebanese they have retained a diphthongal pronunciation: [e\u026a] and [o\u028a].\n* Palestinian dialects differ from Western Syrian as far as short stressed /i/ and /u/ are concerned: in Palestinian they keep a more or less open [\u026a] and [\u028a] pronunciation, and are not neutralised to [\u0259] as in Syrian.\n* The Lebanese and Syrian dialects are more prone to [[im\u0101la]] of /a:/ than the Palestinian dialects are. For instance \u0634\u062a\u0627 'winter' is ['\u0283\u026ata] in Palestinian but ['\u0283\u0259te] in Lebanese and Western Syrian. Some Palestinian dialects ignore imala totally (e.g. Gaza).\n* In morphology, the plural personal pronouns are \u0625\u062d\u0646\u0627['\u026a\u0127na] 'we', \u0647\u0645\u0647['h\u028amme] 'they', \u0643\u0645-[-k\u028am] 'you', \u0647\u0645- [-h\u028am] 'them' in Palestinian, while they are in Syria/Lebanon \u0646\u062d\u0646\u0627['n\u026a\u0127na] 'we', \u0647\u0646\u0647['h\u028anne] 'they', \u0643\u0646-[-k\u028an] 'you', \u0647\u0646- [-h\u028an] 'them'. The variants \u0643\u0648 [-k\u028a] 'you', \u0640\u0647\u0646 [-hen] 'them', and \u0647\u0646\u0647 [hinne] 'they' are used in Northern Palestinian. \n* The conjugation of the imperfect 1st and 3rd person masculine has different prefix vowels. Palestinians say \u0628\u064e\u0643\u062a\u0628['bakt\u028ab] 'I write' \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0648\u0641[ba\u0283u\u02d0f] 'I see' where Lebanese and Syrians say \u0628\u0650\u0643\u062a\u0628['b\u0259kt\u028ab] and \u0628\u0652\u0634\u0648\u0641[b\u0283u\u02d0f]. In the 3rd person masculine, Palestinians say \u0628\u0650\u0643\u062a\u0628['b\u026akt\u028ab] 'He writes'  where Lebanese and Western Syrians say \u0628\u064a\u064e\u0643\u062a\u0628['bj\u0259kt\u028ab]. \n* Hamza-initial verbs commonly have an [o:] prefix sound in the imperfect in Palestinian. For example, Classical Arabic has \u0627\u0643\u0644 /akala/ 'to eat' in the perfect tense, and \u0622\u0643\u0644 /a\u02d0kulu/ with [a:] sound in the first person singular imperfect. The common equivalent in Palestinian Arabic is  \u0627\u0643\u0644 /akal/ in the perfect, with imperfect 1st person singular \u0628\u0648\u0643\u0644 /bo\u02d0kel/ (with the indicative b- prefix.) Thus, in the Galilee and Northern West Bank, the colloquial for the verbal expression, \"I am eating\" or \"I eat\" is commonly ['bo:kel] / ['bo:t\u0283el], rather than ['ba:k\u028al] used in the Western Syrian dialect. Note however that ['ba:kel] or even ['ba:k\u028al] are used in the South of Palestine.\n* The conjugation of the imperative is different too. 'Write!' is \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0628 ['\u028akt\u028ab] in Palestinian, but \u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 [kto\u02d0b], with different stress and vowel and length, in Lebanese and Western Syrian.\n* For the [[Negation in Arabic|negation]] of verbs and prepositional pseudo-verbs, Palestinian, like Egyptian, typically suffixes \u0634 [\u0283] on top of using the preverb negation /ma/, e.g. 'I don't write' is \u0645\u0627\u0628\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0634 [ma bak't\u028ab\u0283] in Palestinian, but \u0645\u0627\u0628\u0643\u062a\u0628 [ma 'b\u0259kt\u028ab] in Northern Levantine (although some areas in southern Lebanon utilise the \u0634 [\u0283] suffix). However, unlike Egyptian, Palestinian allows for \u0634 [\u0283] without the preverb negation /ma/ in the present tense, e.g. \u0628\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0634 [bak'tub\u026a\u0283]. \n* In vocabulary, Palestinian is closer to Lebanese than to Western Syrian, e.g. 'is not' is \u0645\u0634 [m\u0259\u0283] in both Lebanese and Palestinian (although in a few villages \u0645\u0647\u0648\u0634 [mahu\u0283] and \u0645\u0647\u064a\u0634 [mahi\u0283], which are found in Maltese and North African dialects, are used) while it is \u0645\u0648 [mu] in Syrian; 'How?' is \u0643\u064a\u0641 [ki\u02d0f] in Lebanese and Palestinian while it is \u0634\u0644\u0648\u0646 [\u0283lo\u02d0n] in Syrian as in Iraqi (though \u0643\u064a\u0641 is also used) . However, Palestinian also shares items with [[Egyptian Arabic]], e.g. 'like' (prep.) is \u0632\u064a [zejj] in Palestinian in addition to \u0645\u062b\u0644 [m\u026atl], as found in Syrian and Lebanese Arabic.\n\nThere are also typical Palestinian words that are [[shibboleth]]s in the Levant. \n* A frequent Palestinian \u0625\u0634\u064a ['\u026a\u0283i] 'thing, something', as opposed to  \u0634\u064a [\u0283i] in Lebanon and Syria. \n* Besides common Levantine  \u0647\u0644\u0642 ['halla\u0294] 'now', Central Rural dialects around Jerusalem and Ramallah use \u0647\u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u062a [halke:t] (although [hal\u0294e:t] is used in some cities such as Tulkarm, Hebron, and Nablus alongside \u0647\u0644\u0642[halla\u0294] (both from \u0647\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a /halwaqt/ ) and northern Palestinians use \u0625\u0633\u0627['\u026ass\u0251], \u0625\u0633\u0627\u0639 ['\u026ass\u0251\u0295], and \u0647\u0633\u0629 [hass\u0251](from \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0639\u0629/\u026as:\u0251:\u0295\u0251/).

Nablus takes a special place. The Nablus dialect distributed accents on the various syllables of the word. Almost each syllable has a stressed accent, which gives the dialect a slow and sluggish tone. The ancient dialect of Nablus even articulates every single syllable in the same word separately. Moreover, word endings blatantly slant according to a regulated system. For example, you may say sharqa with an [a:] sound at the end of the word to refer to the eastern part of the city and gharbeh with the [e] sound at the end of the word to refer to the western side of the city. You may also want to describe the colour of your bag and say safra (yellow) with an [a:] sound at the end of the word or sode (black) with an [e] sound at the end of the word. The nun and ha (n and h) are always slanted and end with the [e] sound; and they are the bases for the distinctive Nablusi accent. The two letters appear frequently at the end of words in the form of inescapable objective pronouns. In the ancient dialect of Nablus, the letters tha\u2019, thal, thaa\u2019, and qaf do not exist. The dialect of old Nablus is now to be found among the [[Samaritans]], who have managed to preserve the old dialect in its purest form.\n\nUrban dialects are characterised by the [\u0294] ([[hamza]]) pronunciation of \u0642 [[qoph|qaf]], the simplification of interdentals as dentals plosives, i.e.  \u062b as [t], \u0630 as [d] and both  \u0636 and  \u0638 as [d\u02e4]. Note however that in borrowings from [[Modern Standard Arabic]], these interdental consonants are realised as dental sibilants, i.e.  \u062b as [s], \u0630 as [z] and \u0638 as [z\u02e4] but \u0636 is kept as [d\u02e4]. The Druzes have a dialect that may be classified with the Urban ones,{{dubious|date=December 2018}} with the difference that they keep the uvular pronunciation of \u0642 qaf as [q]. The urban dialects also ignore the difference between masculine and feminine in the plural pronouns \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648 ['\u026antu] is both 'you' (masc. plur.) and 'you' (fem. plur.), and  ['h\u028amme] is both 'they' (masc.) and 'they' (fem.)\n\n===Rural varieties===\nRural or farmer ('[[fellah|fallahi]]') variety is retaining the interdental consonants, and is closely related with rural dialects in the outer southern Levant and in Lebanon. They keep the distinction between masculine and feminine plural pronouns, e.g. \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648 ['\u026antu] is 'you' (masc.) while \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0646 ['\u026ant\u026an] is 'you' (fem.), and \u0647\u0645\u0647 ['h\u028amme] is 'they' (masc.) while \u0647\u0646\u0647 ['h\u026anne] is 'they' (fem.).  The three rural groups in the region are the following:\n\n* North Galilean rural dialect - does not feature the k > t\u0283 palatalisation, and many of them have kept the [q] realisation of \u0642 (e.g. Magh\u0101r, Tirat Carmel). In the very north, they announce the Northern Levantine Lebanese dialects with n-ending pronouns such as \u0643\u0646-[-k\u028an] 'you', \u0647\u0646- [-h\u028an] 'them' (Tarshiha, etc.).\n\n* Central rural Palestinian (From Nazareth to Bethlehem, including Jaffa countryside) exhibits a very distinctive feature with pronunciation of \u0643 'kaf' as [t\u0283] 'tshaf' (e.g. \u0643\u0641\u064a\u0629 'keffieh' as [t\u0283\u028a'fijje]) and \u0642 'qaf' as [[pharyngealization|pharyngealised]] /k/ i.e.  [k\u02e4] 'kaf' (e.g. \u0642\u0645\u062d 'wheat' as [k\u02e4\u0251m\u1d4a\u0127]). This k > t\u0283 sound change is not conditioned by the surrounding sounds in Central Palestinian. This combination is unique in the whole Arab world, but could be related to the 'qof' transition to 'kof' in the Aramaic dialect spoken in [[Ma'loula]], north of [[Damascus]].\n* Southern outer rural Levantine Arabic (to the south of an Isdud/[[Ashdod]]-[[Bethlehem]] line) has k > t\u0283 only in presence of front vowels (\u062f\u064a\u0643 'rooster' is [di:t\u0283] in the singular but the plural \u062f\u064a\u0648\u0643 'roosters' is [dju:k] because u prevents /k/ from changing to [t\u0283]). In this dialect \u0642 is not pronounced as [k] but instead as [g]. This dialect is actually very similar to northern Jordanian ([[Ajloun]], [[Irbid]]) and the dialects of Syrian [[Hauran]]. In Southern rural Palestinian, the feminine ending often remains [a].\n\n===Bedouin variety===\nThe Bedouins of Southern Levant use two different ('[[Bedouin|badawi]]') dialects in [[Galilee]] and the [[Negev]]. The Negev desert Bedouins, who are also present in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Gaza Strip]] use a dialect closely related to those spoken in the Hijaz, and in the Sinai. Unlike them, the Bedouins of Galilee speak a dialect related to those of the [[Syrian Desert]] and [[Najd]], which indicates their arrival to the region is relatively recent. The Palestinian resident Negev Bedouins, who are present around Hebron and Jerusalem have a specific vocabulary, they maintain the interdental consonants, they do not use the \u0634-[-\u0283] negative suffix, they always realise \u0643 /k/ as [k] and \u0642 /q/ as [g], and distinguish plural masculine from plural feminine pronouns, but with different forms as the rural speakers.\n\n===Current evolutions===\nOn the urban dialects side, the current trend is to have urban dialects getting closer to their rural neighbours, thus introducing some variability among cities in the Levant. For instance, Jerusalem used to say as Damascus ['n\u026a\u0127na] (\"we\") and ['h\u028anne] (\"they\") at the beginning of the 20th century, and this has moved to the more rural ['\u026a\u0127na] and ['h\u028amme] nowadays.<ref>U. Seeger, Mediterranean Language Review '''10''' (1998), pp. 89-145.</ref> This trend was probably initiated by the partition of the Levant of several states in the course of the 20th century.\n\nThe Rural description given above is moving nowadays with two opposite trends. On the one hand, urbanisation gives a strong influence power to urban dialects. As a result, villagers may adopt them at least in part, and Beduin maintain a two-dialect practice. On the other hand, the individualisation that comes with urbanisation make  people feel more free to choose the way they speak than before, and in the same way as some will use typical Egyptian or Lebanese features as [le:] for [le:\u0283], others may use typical rural features such as the rural realisation [k\u02e4] of \u0642 as a pride reaction against the stigmatisation of this pronunciation.\n\n==Specific aspects of the vocabulary==\nAs Palestinian Arabic is spoken in the heartland of the Semitic languages, it has kept many typical semitic words. For this reason, it is relatively easy to guess how [[Modern Standard Arabic]] words map onto Palestinian Arabic Words. The  list (Swadesh list) of basic word of Palestinian Arabic  available on the Wiktionary (see ''external links'' below) may be used for this. However, some words are not transparent mappings from MSA, and deserve a description. This is due either to meaning changes in Arabic along the centuries - while MSA keeps the [[Classical Arabic]] meanings - or to the adoption of non-Arabic words (see below). Note that this section focuses on Urban Palestinian unless otherwise specified.\n\n'''Prepositional pseudo verbs'''\n\nThe words used in Palestinian to express the basic verbs 'to want', 'to have', 'there is/are' are called prepositional pseudo verbs because they share all the features of verbs but are constructed with a preposition and a suffix pronoun.\n\n* ''there is, there are'' is \u0641\u064a\u0647 [fi] in the imperfect, and \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647 [ka:n fi] in the perfect.\n* To want is formed with b\u026add + suffix pronouns and to have is formed with \u0295\u026and + suffix pronouns.

For instance 'I said to him' was \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0647 ['qultu 'lahu] and 'I wrote to her' was \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 [ka'tabtu la'ha:]. In Palestinian Arabic, the Indirect Object marker is still based on the consonant /l/, but with more complex rules, and two different vocal patterns. The basic form before pronouns is a clitic [\u026all-], that always bears the stress, and to which person pronouns are suffixed. The basic form before nouns is [la]. For instance\n* ... \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0625\u0645\u0643 ['\u0294\u028al\u0259t '''la'''-'\u026ammak ...] 'I told your mother ...'\n* ...\u0627\u0639\u0637\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0643 [\u0294\u0251\u0295t\u02e4e\u02d0na l maktu\u02d0b '''la''' m\u028a'di\u02d0\u027e \u026al ba\u014bk] 'We gave the letter to the bank manager'\n* ... \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0647 [\u0294\u028alt- ''' '\u026all-o''' ...] 'I told him ...'\n* ... \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0647\u0627 [\u0294\u028alt-''' '\u026al(l)-ha''' ...] 'I told her ...'\n* ... \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0651\u064a [katabt-''' '\u026all-i''' ...] 'You wrote me ...'\n\n'''Borrowings'''\n\nPalestinians have borrowed words from the many languages they have been in contact with throughout history. For example,\n* from Aramaic -  especially in the place names, for instance there are several mountains called \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0631  ['\u0292abal \u026at\u02e4 t\u02e4u\u02d0\u027e] where \u0637\u0648\u0631 [t\u02e4u\u02d0\u027e] is just the Aramaic \u05d8\u05d5\u05e8 for 'mountain'.\n* Latin left words in Levantine Arabic, not only those as \u0642\u0635\u0631 [\u0294as\u02e4\u027e] < castrum 'castle' or \u0642\u0644\u0645 [\u0294alam] < calamus which are also known in MSA, but also words such as \u0637\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 [t\u02e4a:wle] < tabula 'table', which are known in the Arab world.\n* from Italian \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 [ban'do:ra] < pomodoro 'tomato'\n* from French \u0643\u062a\u0648 ['ketto] < g\u00e2teau 'cake'\n* from English \u0628\u0646\u0634\u0631 ['ban\u0283ar] < puncture, [tr\u026akk] < truck\n* From Hebrew, especially the [[Arab citizens of Israel]] have adopted many [[Hebraism]]s, like  {{transl|he|yesh}}  {{script/Hebrew|\u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1}} (\"we did it!\" - used as sports cheer) which has no real equivalent in Arabic. According to social linguist Dr. David Mendelson from [[Arab-Israeli peace projects#Givat Haviva.27s Jewish-Arab Center for Peace|Givat Haviva's Jewish-Arab Center for Peace]], there is an adoption of words from Hebrew in Arabic spoken in Israel where alternative native terms exist.

If the root vowel is [[round vowel|rounded]], then the roundness spreads to other high vowels in the [[prefix]]. Vowel harmony in PA is also found in the [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] verbal domain. [[Suffix]]es are immune to rounding harmony, and vowels left of the stressed [[syllable]] do not have vowel harmony.<ref>Kenstowicz, Michael. 1981. Vowel Harmony in Palestinian Arabic: A Suprasegmental Analysis. Linguistics 19:449-465.</ref>\n\nPalestinian Arabic has a regressive vowel harmony for these present tense conjugations: if the verb stem\u2019s main vowel is /u/, then the vowel in the prefix is also /u/, else the vowel is /i/. This is compared with [[standard Arabic]] (which can be seen as representative of other Arabic dialects), where the vowel in the prefix is constantly /a/.<ref>Abu-Salim, Issam. 1987.

Together with [[Jordanian Arabic]], it has the [[ISO 639-3]] language code \"ajp\", known as [[South Levantine Arabic]]. Further dialects can be distinguished within Palestine, such as spoken in the northern [[West Bank]], that spoken by Palestinians in the Hebron area, which is similar to Arabic spoken by descendants of Palestinian refugees living in Jordan and south-western Syria.\n\n== History ==\nThe variations between dialects probably reflect the different historical steps of [[Arabization]] of Palestine.\n\nPrior to their adoption of the Arabic language in the seventh century, the inhabitants of Palestine predominantly spoke [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Palestinian Aramaic]] (as witnessed, for example, in Palestinian Jewish and Palestinian Christian literature), as well as [[Greek language|Greek]] (probably in the upper or trader social classes), and some remaining traces of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. At that time in history, Arabic-speaking people living in the Negev desert or in the Jordan desert beyond Zarqa, Amman or Karak had no significant influence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nArabic-speaking people such as the Nabataeans tended to adopt Aramaic as a written language as shown in the [[Nabataean Aramaic|Nabataean language]] texts of [[Petra]]. Jews and Nabataeans lived side by side in Mahoza and other villages, and their dialects of what they would both have thought of as \u201cAramaic\u201d would almost certainly have been mutually comprehensible. Additionally, occasional Arabic loan can be found in the Jewish Aramaic documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=Michael C. A.|title=How much can we know about language and literacy in Roman Judaea? A review|url=https://www.academia.edu/38960413|journal=Journal of Roman Archaeology|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[language shift|adoption of Arabic]] among the local population occurred most probably in several waves. After the Arabs took control of the area, so as to maintain their regular activity, the upper classes had quickly to get fluency in the language of the new masters who most probably were only few. The prevalence of Northern Levantine features in the urban dialects until the early 20th century, as well as in the dialect of [[Samaritans]] in Nablus (with systematic imala of /a:/) tends to show that a first layer of Arabization of urban upper classes could have led to what is now urban Levantine. Then, the main phenomenon could have been the slow countryside shift of Aramaic-speaking villages to Arabic under the influence of Arabized elites, leading to the emergence of the rural Palestinian dialects{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. This scenario is consistent with several facts.\n\n* The rural forms can be correlated with features also observed in the few Syrian villages where use of Aramaic has been retained up to this day. Palatalisation of /k/ (but of /t/ too), pronunciation [k\u02e4] of /q/  for instance. Note that the first also exists in [[Najdi Arabic]] and [[Gulf Arabic]], but limited to palatal contexts (/k/ followed by i or a). Moreover, those Eastern dialects have [g] or [d\u0292] for /q/ {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.\n* The less-evolutive urban forms can be explained by a limitation owed to the contacts urban trader classes had to maintain with Arabic speakers of other towns in Syria or Egypt.\n* The Negev Bedouins dialect shares a number of features with bedouin Hejazi dialects (unlike Urban Hejazi).\n\n== Differences compared to other Levantine Arabic dialects ==\n[[File:Manual of Palestinean Arabic, for self-instruction 1909.png|thumb|Manual of Palestinean Arabic, for self-instruction (1909)]]\nThe dialects spoken by the Arabs of the Levant \u2013 the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean \u2013 or [[Levantine Arabic]], form a group of dialects of Arabic. Arabic manuals for the \"Syrian dialect\" were produced in the early 20th century,<ref>Crow, F.E., ''Arabic manual: a colloquia handbook in the Syrian dialect, for the use of visitors to Syria and Palestine, containing a simplified grammar, a comprehensive English and Arabic vocabulary and dialogues'', Luzac & co, London, 1901</ref> and in 1909 a specific \"Palestinean Arabic\" manual was published.\n\nThe Palestinian Arabic dialects are varieties of Levantine Arabic because they display the following characteristic Levantine features.\n* A conservative stress pattern, closer to Classical Arabic than anywhere else in the Arab world.\n* The indicative imperfect with a b- prefix\n* A very frequent [[Im\u0101la]] of the feminine ending in front consonant context (names in -eh).\n* A [\u0294] realisation of /q/ in the cities, and a [q] realisation of /q/ by the Druzes{{dubious|date=December 2018}}, and more variants (including [k]) in the countryside.\n* A shared lexicon\n\nThe noticeable differences between southern and northern forms of Levantine Arabic, such as [[Syrian Arabic]] and [[Lebanese Arabic]], are stronger in non-urban dialects. The main differences between Palestinian and northern Levantine Arabic are as follows:\n\n* Phonetically, Palestinian dialects differ from Lebanese regarding the classical diphthongs /aj/ and /aw/, which have simplified to [e\u02d0] and [o:] in Palestinian dialects as in Western Syrian, while in Lebanese they have retained a diphthongal pronunciation: [e\u026a] and [o\u028a].\n* Palestinian dialects differ from Western Syrian as far as short stressed /i/ and /u/ are concerned: in Palestinian they keep a more or less open [\u026a] and [\u028a] pronunciation, and are not neutralised to [\u0259] as in Syrian.\n* The Lebanese and Syrian dialects are more prone to [[im\u0101la]] of /a:/ than the Palestinian dialects are. For instance \u0634\u062a\u0627 'winter' is ['\u0283\u026ata] in Palestinian but ['\u0283\u0259te] in Lebanese and Western Syrian. Some Palestinian dialects ignore imala totally (e.g. Gaza).\n* In morphology, the plural personal pronouns are \u0625\u062d\u0646\u0627['\u026a\u0127na] 'we', \u0647\u0645\u0647['h\u028amme] 'they', \u0643\u0645-[-k\u028am] 'you', \u0647\u0645- [-h\u028am] 'them' in Palestinian, while they are in Syria/Lebanon \u0646\u062d\u0646\u0627['n\u026a\u0127na] 'we', \u0647\u0646\u0647['h\u028anne] 'they', \u0643\u0646-[-k\u028an] 'you', \u0647\u0646- [-h\u028an] 'them'. The variants \u0643\u0648 [-k\u028a] 'you', \u0640\u0647\u0646 [-hen] 'them', and \u0647\u0646\u0647 [hinne] 'they' are used in Northern Palestinian. \n* The conjugation of the imperfect 1st and 3rd person masculine has different prefix vowels. Palestinians say \u0628\u064e\u0643\u062a\u0628['bakt\u028ab] 'I write' \u0628\u064e\u0634\u0648\u0641[ba\u0283u\u02d0f] 'I see' where Lebanese and Syrians say \u0628\u0650\u0643\u062a\u0628['b\u0259kt\u028ab] and \u0628\u0652\u0634\u0648\u0641[b\u0283u\u02d0f]. In the 3rd person masculine, Palestinians say \u0628\u0650\u0643\u062a\u0628['b\u026akt\u028ab] 'He writes'  where Lebanese and Western Syrians say \u0628\u064a\u064e\u0643\u062a\u0628['bj\u0259kt\u028ab]. \n* Hamza-initial verbs commonly have an [o:] prefix sound in the imperfect in Palestinian. For example, Classical Arabic has \u0627\u0643\u0644 /akala/ 'to eat' in the perfect tense, and \u0622\u0643\u0644 /a\u02d0kulu/ with [a:] sound in the first person singular imperfect. The common equivalent in Palestinian Arabic is  \u0627\u0643\u0644 /akal/ in the perfect, with imperfect 1st person singular \u0628\u0648\u0643\u0644 /bo\u02d0kel/ (with the indicative b- prefix.) Thus, in the Galilee and Northern West Bank, the colloquial for the verbal expression, \"I am eating\" or \"I eat\" is commonly ['bo:kel] / ['bo:t\u0283el], rather than ['ba:k\u028al] used in the Western Syrian dialect. Note however that ['ba:kel] or even ['ba:k\u028al] are used in the South of Palestine.\n* The conjugation of the imperative is different too. 'Write!' is \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0628 ['\u028akt\u028ab] in Palestinian, but \u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 [kto\u02d0b], with different stress and vowel and length, in Lebanese and Western Syrian.\n* For the [[Negation in Arabic|negation]] of verbs and prepositional pseudo-verbs, Palestinian, like Egyptian, typically suffixes \u0634 [\u0283] on top of using the preverb negation /ma/, e.g. 'I don't write' is \u0645\u0627\u0628\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0634 [ma bak't\u028ab\u0283] in Palestinian, but \u0645\u0627\u0628\u0643\u062a\u0628 [ma 'b\u0259kt\u028ab] in Northern Levantine (although some areas in southern Lebanon utilise the \u0634 [\u0283] suffix). However, unlike Egyptian, Palestinian allows for \u0634 [\u0283] without the preverb negation /ma/ in the present tense, e.g. \u0628\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0634 [bak'tub\u026a\u0283]. \n* In vocabulary, Palestinian is closer to Lebanese than to Western Syrian, e.g. 'is not' is \u0645\u0634 [m\u0259\u0283] in both Lebanese and Palestinian (although in a few villages \u0645\u0647\u0648\u0634 [mahu\u0283] and \u0645\u0647\u064a\u0634 [mahi\u0283], which are found in Maltese and North African dialects, are used) while it is \u0645\u0648 [mu] in Syrian; 'How?' is \u0643\u064a\u0641 [ki\u02d0f] in Lebanese and Palestinian while it is \u0634\u0644\u0648\u0646 [\u0283lo\u02d0n] in Syrian as in Iraqi (though \u0643\u064a\u0641 is also used) . However, Palestinian also shares items with [[Egyptian Arabic]], e.g. 'like' (prep.) is \u0632\u064a [zejj] in Palestinian in addition to \u0645\u062b\u0644 [m\u026atl], as found in Syrian and Lebanese Arabic.\n\nThere are also typical Palestinian words that are [[shibboleth]]s in the Levant. \n* A frequent Palestinian \u0625\u0634\u064a ['\u026a\u0283i] 'thing, something', as opposed to  \u0634\u064a [\u0283i] in Lebanon and Syria. \n* Besides common Levantine  \u0647\u0644\u0642 ['halla\u0294] 'now', Central Rural dialects around Jerusalem and Ramallah use \u0647\u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u062a [halke:t] (although [hal\u0294e:t] is used in some cities such as Tulkarm, Hebron, and Nablus alongside \u0647\u0644\u0642[halla\u0294] (both from \u0647\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a /halwaqt/ ) and northern Palestinians use \u0625\u0633\u0627['\u026ass\u0251], \u0625\u0633\u0627\u0639 ['\u026ass\u0251\u0295], and \u0647\u0633\u0629 [hass\u0251](from \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0639\u0629/\u026as:\u0251:\u0295\u0251/). Peasants in the southern West Bank also use \u0647\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646 [hala\u0127in] or \u0647\u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646\u0629 [hal\u0127ina] (both from \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0646 [ha\u02d0\u00f0a \u2018al\u0127in])\n*Some rural Palestinians use \u0628\u0642\u0649 [baqa] (meaning 'remained' in MSA) as a verb to be alongside the standard \u0643\u0627\u0646 [ka:n] ([ka:na in MSA)\n\n==Social and geographic dialect structuration==\nAs is very common in Arabic-speaking countries, the dialect spoken by a person depends on both the region he/she comes from, and the social group he/she belongs to.\n\n===Palestinian urban dialects===\nThe Urban ('madani') dialects resemble closely northern Levantine Arabic dialects, that is, the colloquial variants of western [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].<ref name=\"Sociolinguistics/Soziolinguistik 3: An International Handbook\">{{cite book|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|title=Sociolinguistics/Soziolinguistik 3: An International Handbook of the Science|year=2006|pages=1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C&lpg=PA1922&dq=levantine%20arabic%20influences&pg=PR4#v=onepage&q=levantine%20arabic%20influences&f=false|isbn=9783110184181}}</ref> This fact, that makes the urban dialects of the Levant remarkably homogeneous, is probably due to the trading network among cities in the Ottoman Levant, or to an older Arabic dialect layer closer to the qeltu dialects still spoken in northern Iraq/Syria and Southern Turkey. Nablus takes a special place. The Nablus dialect distributed accents on the various syllables of the word. Almost each syllable has a stressed accent, which gives the dialect a slow and sluggish tone. The ancient dialect of Nablus even articulates every single syllable in the same word separately. Moreover, word endings blatantly slant according to a regulated system. For example, you may say sharqa with an [a:] sound at the end of the word to refer to the eastern part of the city and gharbeh with the [e] sound at the end of the word to refer to the western side of the city. You may also want to describe the colour of your bag and say safra (yellow) with an [a:] sound at the end of the word or sode (black) with an [e] sound at the end of the word. The nun and ha (n and h) are always slanted and end with the [e] sound; and they are the bases for the distinctive Nablusi accent. The two letters appear frequently at the end of words in the form of inescapable objective pronouns. In the ancient dialect of Nablus, the letters tha\u2019, thal, thaa\u2019, and qaf do not exist. The dialect of old Nablus is now to be found among the [[Samaritans]], who have managed to preserve the old dialect in its purest form.\n\nUrban dialects are characterised by the [\u0294] ([[hamza]]) pronunciation of \u0642 [[qoph|qaf]], the simplification of interdentals as dentals plosives, i.e.  \u062b as [t], \u0630 as [d] and both  \u0636 and  \u0638 as [d\u02e4]. Note however that in borrowings from [[Modern Standard Arabic]], these interdental consonants are realised as dental sibilants, i.e.  \u062b as [s], \u0630 as [z] and both  \u0636 and  \u0638 as [z\u02e4]. The Druzes have a dialect that may be classified with the Urban ones,{{dubious|date=December 2018}} with the difference that they keep the uvular pronunciation of \u0642 qaf as [q]. The urban dialects also ignore the difference between masculine and feminine in the plural pronouns \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648 ['\u026antu] is both 'you' (masc. plur.) and 'you' (fem. plur.), and  ['h\u028amme] is both 'they' (masc.) and 'they' (fem.)\n\n===Rural varieties===\nRural or farmer ('[[fellah|fallahi]]') variety is retaining the interdental consonants, and is closely related with rural dialects in the outer southern Levant and in Lebanon. They keep the distinction between masculine and feminine plural pronouns, e.g. \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648 ['\u026antu] is 'you' (masc.) while \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0646 ['\u026ant\u026an] is 'you' (fem.), and \u0647\u0645\u0647 ['h\u028amme] is 'they' (masc.) while \u0647\u0646\u0647 ['h\u026anne] is 'they' (fem.).  The three rural groups in the region are the following:\n* Central rural Palestinian (From Nazareth to Bethlehem, including Jaffa countryside) exhibits a very distinctive feature with pronunciation of \u0643 'kaf' as [t\u0283] 'tshaf' (e.g. \u0643\u0641\u064a\u0629 'keffieh' as [t\u0283\u028a'fijje]) and \u0642 'qaf' as [[pharyngealization|pharyngealised]] /k/ i.e.  [k\u02e4] 'kaf' (e.g. \u0642\u0645\u062d 'wheat' as [k\u02e4\u0251m\u1d4a\u0127]). This k > t\u0283 sound change is not conditioned by the surrounding sounds in Central Palestinian. This combination is unique in the whole Arab world, but could be related to the 'qof' transition to 'kof' in the Aramaic dialect spoken in [[Ma'loula]], north of [[Damascus]].\n* Southern outer rural Levantine Arabic (to the south of an Isdud/[[Ashdod]]-[[Bethlehem]] line) has k > t\u0283 only in presence of front vowels (\u062f\u064a\u0643 'rooster' is [di:t\u0283] in the singular but the plural \u062f\u064a\u0648\u0643 'roosters' is [dju:k] because u prevents /k/ from changing to [t\u0283]). In this dialect \u0642 is not pronounced as [k] but instead as [g]. This dialect is actually very similar to northern Jordanian ([[Ajloun]], [[Irbid]]) and the dialects of Syrian [[Hauran]]. In Southern rural Palestinian, the feminine ending often remains [a].\n* North Galilean rural dialect - does not feature the k > t\u0283 palatalisation, and many of them have kept the [q] realisation of \u0642 (e.g. Magh\u0101r, Tirat Carmel). In the very north, they announce the Northern Levantine Lebanese dialects with n-ending pronouns such as \u0643\u0646-[-k\u028an] 'you', \u0647\u0646- [-h\u028an] 'them' (Tarshiha, etc.).\n\n===Bedouin variety===\nThe Bedouins of Southern Levant use two different ('[[Bedouin|badawi]]') dialects in [[Galilee]] and the [[Negev]]. The Negev desert Bedouins, who are also present in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Gaza Strip]] use a dialect closely related to those spoken in the Hijaz, and in the Sinai. Unlike them, the Bedouins of Galilee speak a dialect related to those of the [[Syrian Desert]] and [[Najd]], which indicates their arrival to the region is relatively recent. The Palestinian resident Negev Bedouins, who are present around Hebron and Jerusalem have a specific vocabulary, they maintain the interdental consonants, they do not use the \u0634-[-\u0283] negative suffix, they always realise \u0643 /k/ as [k] and \u0642 /q/ as [g], and distinguish plural masculine from plural feminine pronouns, but with different forms as the rural speakers.\n\n===Current evolutions===\nOn the urban dialects side, the current trend is to have urban dialects getting closer to their rural neighbours, thus introducing some variability among cities in the Levant. For instance, Jerusalem used to say as Damascus ['n\u026a\u0127na] (\"we\") and ['h\u028anne] (\"they\") at the beginning of the 20th century, and this has moved to the more rural ['\u026a\u0127na] and ['h\u028amme] nowadays.<ref>U. Seeger, Mediterranean Language Review '''10''' (1998), pp. 89-145.</ref> This trend was probably initiated by the partition of the Levant of several states in the course of the 20th century.\n\nThe Rural description given above is moving nowadays with two opposite trends. On the one hand, urbanisation gives a strong influence power to urban dialects. As a result, villagers may adopt them at least in part, and Beduin maintain a two-dialect practice. On the other hand, the individualisation that comes with urbanisation make  people feel more free to choose the way they speak than before, and in the same way as some will use typical Egyptian or Lebanese features as [le:] for [le:\u0283], others may use typical rural features such as the rural realisation [k\u02e4] of \u0642 as a pride reaction against the stigmatisation of this pronunciation.\n\n==Specific aspects of the vocabulary==\nAs Palestinian Arabic is spoken in the heartland of the Semitic languages, it has kept many typical semitic words. For this reason, it is relatively easy to guess how [[Modern Standard Arabic]] words map onto Palestinian Arabic Words. The  list (Swadesh list) of basic word of Palestinian Arabic  available on the Wiktionary (see ''external links'' below) may be used for this. However, some words are not transparent mappings from MSA, and deserve a description. This is due either to meaning changes in Arabic along the centuries - while MSA keeps the [[Classical Arabic]] meanings - or to the adoption of non-Arabic words (see below). Note that this section focuses on Urban Palestinian unless otherwise specified.\n\n'''Prepositional pseudo verbs'''\n\nThe words used in Palestinian to express the basic verbs 'to want', 'to have', 'there is/are' are called prepositional pseudo verbs because they share all the features of verbs but are constructed with a preposition and a suffix pronoun.\n\n* ''there is, there are'' is \u0641\u064a\u0647 [fi] in the imperfect, and \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0647 [ka:n fi] in the perfect.\n* To want is formed with b\u026add + suffix pronouns and to have is formed with \u0295\u026and + suffix pronouns.

For instance 'I said to him' was \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0647 ['qultu 'lahu] and 'I wrote to her' was \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 [ka'tabtu la'ha:]. In Palestinian Arabic, the Indirect Object marker is still based on the consonant /l/, but with more complex rules, and two different vocal patterns. The basic form before pronouns is a clitic [\u026all-], that always bears the stress, and to which person pronouns are suffixed. The basic form before nouns is [la]. For instance\n* ... \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0625\u0645\u0643 ['\u0294\u028al\u0259t '''la'''-'\u026ammak ...] 'I told your mother ...'\n* ...\u0627\u0639\u0637\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0643 [\u0294\u0251\u0295t\u02e4e\u02d0na l maktu\u02d0b '''la''' m\u028a'di\u02d0\u027e \u026al ba\u014bk] 'We gave the letter to the bank manager'\n* ... \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0647 [\u0294\u028alt- ''' '\u026all-o''' ...] 'I told him ...'\n* ... \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0647\u0627 [\u0294\u028alt-''' '\u026al(l)-ha''' ...] 'I told her ...'\n* ... \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0651\u064a [katabt-''' '\u026all-i''' ...] 'You wrote me ...'\n\n'''Borrowings'''\n\nPalestinians have borrowed words from the many languages they have been in contact with throughout history. For example,\n* from Aramaic -  especially in the place names, for instance there are several mountains called \u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0631  ['\u0292abal \u026at\u02e4 t\u02e4u\u02d0\u027e] where \u0637\u0648\u0631 [t\u02e4u\u02d0\u027e] is just the Aramaic \u05d8\u05d5\u05e8 for 'mountain'.\n* Latin left words in Levantine Arabic, not only those as \u0642\u0635\u0631 [\u0294as\u02e4\u027e] < castrum 'castle' or \u0642\u0644\u0645 [\u0294alam] < calamus which are also known in MSA, but also words such as \u0637\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 [t\u02e4a:wle] < tabula 'table', which are known in the Arab world.\n* from Italian \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 [ban'do:ra] < pomodoro 'tomato'\n* from French \u0643\u062a\u0648 ['ketto] < g\u00e2teau 'cake'\n* from English \u0628\u0646\u0634\u0631 ['ban\u0283ar] < puncture, [tr\u026akk] < truck\n* From Hebrew, especially the [[Arab citizens of Israel]] have adopted many [[Hebraism]]s, like  {{transl|he|yesh}}  {{script/Hebrew|\u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1}} (\"we did it!\" - used as sports cheer) which has no real equivalent in Arabic. According to social linguist Dr. David Mendelson from [[Arab-Israeli peace projects#Givat Haviva.27s Jewish-Arab Center for Peace|Givat Haviva's Jewish-Arab Center for Peace]], there is an adoption of words from Hebrew in Arabic spoken in Israel where alternative native terms exist. According to linguist Mohammed Omara, of [[Bar-Ilan University]] some researchers call the Arabic spoken by Israeli Arabs ''Arabrew''. The list of words adopted contain: \n** \u0631\u0645\u0632\u0648\u0631 [ram'zo:r] from {{script/Hebrew|\u05e8\u05b7\u05de\u05b0\u05d6\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8}} 'traffic light'\n** \u0634\u0645\u0646\u064a\u062a ['\u0283amenet] from {{script/Hebrew|\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05de\u05b6\u05bc\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea}} 'sour cream'\n** \u0628\u0633\u062f\u0631 [be'seder] from {{script/Hebrew|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e1\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8}} 'O.K, alright'\n** \u0643\u0648\u062e\u0641\u064a\u062a [koxa'vi:t] from {{script/Hebrew|\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05db\u05b8\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea}} 'asterisk'\n** \u0628\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0646 [pele'fo:n] from {{script/Hebrew|\u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0\u05e4\u05d5\u05b9\u05df}} 'cellular phone'.\n\nPalestinians in the Palestinian territories sometimes refer to their brethren in Israel as \"the b'seder Arabs\" because of their adoption of the Hebrew word \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e1\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8 [beseder] for 'O.K.', (while Arabic is \u0645\u0627\u0634\u064a[ma:\u0283i]). However words like  {{transl|he|ramzor}} {{script/Hebrew|\u05e8\u05b7\u05de\u05b0\u05d6\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8}} 'traffic light' and {{transl|he|ma\u1e25som}} {{script/Hebrew|\u05de\u05b7\u05d7\u05b0\u05e1\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd}} 'roadblock' have become a part of the general Palestinian vernacular.\n\nThe 2009 film ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' is mostly spoken in Palestinian-Hebrew Arabic.\n\n===Vowel harmony===\nThe most often cited example of [[vowel harmony]] in Palestinian Arabic is in the [[present tense]] [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s of verbs. If the root vowel is [[round vowel|rounded]], then the roundness spreads to other high vowels in the [[prefix]]. Vowel harmony in PA is also found in the [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] verbal domain. [[Suffix]]es are immune to rounding harmony, and vowels left of the stressed [[syllable]] do not have vowel harmony.<ref>Kenstowicz, Michael. 1981. Vowel Harmony in Palestinian Arabic: A Suprasegmental Analysis. Linguistics 19:449-465.</ref>\n\nPalestinian Arabic has a regressive vowel harmony for these present tense conjugations: if the verb stem\u2019s main vowel is /u/, then the vowel in the prefix is also /u/, else the vowel is /i/. This is compared with [[standard Arabic]] (which can be seen as representative of other Arabic dialects), where the vowel in the prefix is constantly /a/.<ref>Abu-Salim, Issam. 1987.
