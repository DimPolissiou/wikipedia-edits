Beck researched all the records played that night and published their production information as an artist book in 2013 (a revised second edition was published in 2019). The culmination of his project was a thirteen-and-half hour video work, first presented as an installation at [[The Kitchen]] in New York (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filthydreams.org/2017/03/26/lost-in-music-reclaiming-past-disco-days-at-martin-becks-last-night/|title=Lost In Music: Reclaiming Past Disco Days At Martin Beck\u2019s \u2018Last Night\u2019|first=Emily|last=Colucci|date=March 2017|publisher=filthy dreams}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thekitchen.org/event/martin-beck-last-night|title=Martin Beck: Last Night|date=March 2017|publisher=The Kitchen}}</ref> The video shows each record played in its entirety on a vintage turntable.\n\nBoth projects explore the notion of community, however temporal, and the social and physical structures that are required for its formation. Art historian Branden W.

For the work titled ''rumors and murmurs'' (2012/17), Beck used an illustration from the 1968 ''Dome Cookbook'' by [[Steve Baer]], a manual for dome building, to create a freestanding wall covered in fabric sewn together from irregular polygons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/martin-beck-47-canal/|title=Long Way Home: Martin Beck at 47 Canal|first=Aimee|last=Walleston|date=November 2012|publisher=Art in America}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, Beck worked on ''Last Night'', a series of works centered around a sequence of records [[David Mancuso]] played on June 2, 1984 during one of the last dance parties of the Prince Street iteration of [[The Loft (New York City)|The Loft]], an underground dance party begun by Mancuso in 1970. Beck researched all the records played that night and published their production information as an artist book in 2013 (a revised second edition was published in 2019). The culmination of his project was a thirteen-and-half hour video work, first presented as an installation at [[The Kitchen]] in New York (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filthydreams.org/2017/03/26/lost-in-music-reclaiming-past-disco-days-at-martin-becks-last-night/|title=Lost In Music: Reclaiming Past Disco Days At Martin Beck\u2019s \u2018Last Night\u2019|first=Emily|last=Colucci|date=March 2017|publisher=filthy dreams}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thekitchen.org/event/martin-beck-last-night|title=Martin Beck: Last Night|date=March 2017|publisher=The Kitchen}}</ref> The video shows each record played in its entirety on a vintage turntable.\n\nBoth projects explore the notion of community, however temporal, and the social and physical structures that are required for its formation. Art historian Branden W. Joseph wrote: \u201cThe question \u2018Is there a form to shared togetherness?\u2019 guided Beck\u2019s investigation into both the communes of the 1960s... and the disco of the \u201970s and early \u201980s, two cultural poles most often perceived as in stark opposition to each other. (This dichotomy is similar to that between the counterculture of the \u201960s and the management culture of the following decades, which Beck\u2019s work also deconstructs.)\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artforum.com/print/201710/branden-w-joseph-72458|title=Best of 2017: Martin Beck|last1=Joseph|first1=Brandon|date=|website=|publisher=Artforum|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Beck was commissioned to develop a project to go along with the re-branding, initiated by then-director James Voorhies, of the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] at Harvard University.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://carpenter.center/program/martin-beck-program|title=Martin Beck: Program|date= October 2016|publisher=Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts}}</ref> The commission resulted in a two-year exhibition titled ''Program'' that consisted of ten episodic interventions, each addressing one of the institution\u2019s channels of communication.

Female reproduction is distributed over their adult life-span which lasts about a year. Flour beetles also display pre-mating discrimination among potential mates. Female flour beetles, specifically of ''T. castaneum'', can mate with different males and may choose more attractive males over the course of their adult life-span. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fedina |first1=Tatyana Y. |last2=Lewis |first2=Sara M. |title=An integrative view of sexual selection in Tribolium flour beetles |journal=Biological Reviews |date=21 April 2018 |volume=83 |issue=2 |page=151\u2013171 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00037.x}}</ref>\n\n== Selected species ==\n* ''[[North American flour beetle|Aphanotus brevicornis]]'' &ndash; North American flour beetle\n* ''[[Red flour beetle|Tribolium castaneum]]'' &ndash; red flour beetle\n* ''[[Confused flour beetle|Tribolium confusum]]'' &ndash; confused flour beetle\n* ''[[Destructive flour beetle|Tribolium destructor]]'' &ndash; destructive flour beetle\n* ''[[mealworm|Tenebrio molitor]]'' &ndash; yellow mealworm beetle\n* ''[[Tenebrio obscurus]]'' &ndash; dark mealworm beetle\n\n== Research ==\nIn 2008, the ''Tribolium castaneum'' [[genome]] was sequenced by the ''Tribolium'' Genome Sequencing Consortium.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schr\u00f6der, R. |date=2008 |title=The genome of the model beetle and pest ''Tribolium castaneum'' |journal=Nature |volume=452 |issue=7190 |pages=949\u2013955 |doi=10.1038/nature06784 |bibcode=2008Natur.452..949R |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{NIE Poster|Flour Beetle}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q4273216}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flour Beetle}}\n[[Category:Tenebrionidae]]\n[[Category:Storage pests]]\n[[Category:Insect common names]]\n\n{{Tenebrionidae-stub}}\n\n[[de:Mehlk\u00e4fer]]\n[[ms:Kumbang tepung]]\n", "name_user": "Entomologger", "label": "safe", "comment": "Links added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_beetle"}
