Each province had its own Lieutenant-Governor and Legislative and Executive Council, in addition to the Governor-in-Chief and Legislative and Executive Council for the whole colony. Early in 1848 [[Edward John Eyre]] was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Munster. In 1851 the Provincial Legislative Councils were permitted to be partially elective.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-constitutional/3 http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-constitutional/3]</ref>\n\nThe Provincial Council of New Munster had only one legislative session, in 1849, before it succumbed to the virulent attacks of the [[Wellington]] settlers. Governor [[George Grey]], sensible to the pressures, inspired an ordinance of the General Legislative Council under which new Legislative Councils would be established in each province with two-thirds of their members elected on a generous franchise. Grey implemented the ordinance with such deliberation that neither Council met before advice was received that the United Kingdom Parliament had passed the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]].\n\nThis Act dissolved the New Ulster and New Munster provinces in 1853, after only seven years' existence, and New Munster was divided into the provinces of [[Canterbury Province|Canterbury]], [[Nelson Province|Nelson]], and [[Otago Province|Otago]]. With the establishment of the [[New Zealand Parliament]], [[James Macandrew]] the Superintendent of [[Otago Province]] fought what he saw as a bias towards central government at the expense of Otago. Similar resentment also occurred in other provinces, but the relative wealth of Otago (due to the [[Otago Gold Rush|1861 gold rush]]) meant that it was felt there more strongly than elsewhere.<ref>Oliver, W.H.

In 1861, gold was discovered at [[Gabriel's Gully]] in [[Central Otago]], sparking a [[Otago Gold Rush|gold rush]]. [[Dunedin]] became the wealthiest city in the country, and many in the South Island resented financing the [[New Zealand Wars|North Island's war]] and less ready to accept direction from a General Assembly whose impoverished members \"looked with ill-concealed envy\" on the resources of the South. It was, noted the ''[[Otago Colonist]]'', \"the sad but inevitable result of joining by artificial bonds of union countries that Nature (by [[Cook Strait]]) designed should be separate\". [[Otago]], argued its editor, [[Julius Vogel]] (who, ironically, was ultimately to lead the centralists to the abolition of provincialism), was in terms of shipping days three times as far from the capital of Auckland as it was from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] or [[Tasmania]], and he looked forward to \"a glorious future \u2013 the separation of the two islands\". A well-attended public meeting in 1862 endorsed the principle of separation \u2013 though [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]], which had achieved independence from Dunedin only by appealing to central government, and [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], understanding that Dunedin saw itself as the South Island's capital-to-be, were both unenthusiastic.<ref name=\"dreamlike\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamlike.info/nzl/southisland.htm|title=New Zealand - South Island, The South Island and the Constitution|publisher=dreamlike.info|access-date=21 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723180830/http://www.dreamlike.info/nzl/southisland.htm|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA \"Southern Separation League\"<ref name=\"Luceo\">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=DSC18650120.2.19&l=mi&e=-------10--1----0--|title=Luceo Non Uro|date=20 January 1865|work=[[The Daily Southern Cross]]|publisher=Papers Past|page=4|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> was formed, but Vogel had by then recognised the signs of decay in the provincial system. Seeing that the weaker provinces were heading for insolvency, he opted in favour of centralism \u2013 and promptly changed his electorate to stand for a northern seat.\n\nIn an attempt to hold her place as a capital of some description, in 1865 Auckland joined forces with Otago to support a resolution in the General Assembly calling for independence for both islands. They lost by 31 votes to 17. In the same year the political concerns of the South Island provinces prompted the colonial government to move the capital south from Auckland to Wellington.

In 1851 the Provincial Legislative Councils were permitted to be partially elective.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-constitutional/3 http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-constitutional/3]</ref>\n\nThe Provincial Council of New Munster had only one legislative session, in 1849, before it succumbed to the virulent attacks of the [[Wellington]] settlers. Governor [[George Grey]], sensible to the pressures, inspired an ordinance of the General Legislative Council under which new Legislative Councils would be established in each province with two-thirds of their members elected on a generous franchise. Grey implemented the ordinance with such deliberation that neither Council met before advice was received that the United Kingdom Parliament had passed the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]].\n\nThis Act dissolved the New Ulster and New Munster provinces in 1853, after only seven years' existence, and New Munster was divided into the provinces of [[Canterbury Province|Canterbury]], [[Nelson Province|Nelson]], and [[Otago Province|Otago]]. With the establishment of the [[New Zealand Parliament]], [[James Macandrew]] the Superintendent of [[Otago Province]] fought what he saw as a bias towards central government at the expense of Otago. Similar resentment also occurred in other provinces, but the relative wealth of Otago (due to the [[Otago Gold Rush|1861 gold rush]]) meant that it was felt there more strongly than elsewhere.<ref>Oliver, W.H.

In 1861, gold was discovered at [[Gabriel's Gully]] in [[Central Otago]], sparking a [[Otago Gold Rush|gold rush]]. [[Dunedin]] became the wealthiest city in the country, and many in the South Island resented financing the [[New Zealand Wars|North Island's war]] and less ready to accept direction from a General Assembly whose impoverished members \"looked with ill-concealed envy\" on the resources of the South. It was, noted the ''[[Otago Colonist]]'', \"the sad but inevitable result of joining by artificial bonds of union countries that Nature (by [[Cook Strait]]) designed should be separate\". [[Otago]], argued its editor, [[Julius Vogel]] (who, ironically, was ultimately to lead the centralists to the abolition of provincialism), was in terms of shipping days three times as far from the capital of Auckland as it was from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] or [[Tasmania]], and he looked forward to \"a glorious future \u2013 the separation of the two islands\". A well-attended public meeting in 1862 endorsed the principle of separation \u2013 though [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]], which had achieved independence from Dunedin only by appealing to central government, and [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], understanding that Dunedin saw itself as the South Island's capital-to-be, were both unenthusiastic.<ref name=\"dreamlike\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamlike.info/nzl/southisland.htm|title=New Zealand - South Island, The South Island and the Constitution|publisher=dreamlike.info|access-date=21 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723180830/http://www.dreamlike.info/nzl/southisland.htm|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA \"Southern Separation League\"<ref name=\"Luceo\">{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=DSC18650120.2.19&l=mi&e=-------10--1----0--|title=Luceo Non Uro|date=20 January 1865|work=[[The Daily Southern Cross]]|publisher=Papers Past|page=4|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> was formed, but Vogel had by then recognised the signs of decay in the provincial system.

They lost by 31 votes to 17. In the same year the political concerns of the South Island provinces prompted the colonial government to move the capital south from Auckland to Wellington.

In [[ancient philosophy]], any attenuated \"thin\" matter such as [[air]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[fire]] or [[light]] was considered incorporeal.<ref>Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/212/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 212</ref> The ancient Greeks believed [[air (classical element)|air]], as opposed to solid [[earth (classical element)|earth]], to be incorporeal, in so far as it is less resistant to movement; and the ancient Persians believed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be incorporeal in that every soul was said to be produced from it.<ref>Priestley, Joseph. [https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/232/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 235</ref> In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.\n\nIn the [[problem of universals]], universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a [[hylomorphic]] account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. Aristotle used the Greek terms ''[[wikt:somatic|soma]]'' (body) and ''[[hyle]]'' (matter, literally \"wood\").\n\nThe notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept [[action at a distance]] as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing.\n\n==In Philosophy==\n[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]] depicted by Raphael.]]On [[Empedocles]] and incorporeal, [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] writes:<blockquote>\"The Love and Strife of Empedokles are no incorporeal forces. They are active, indeed, but they are still corporeal. At the time, this was inevitable; nothing incorporeal had yet been dreamt of. Naturally, Aristotle is puzzled by this characteristic of what he regarded as efficient causes. \u201c The Love of Empedokles,\u201d he says is both an efficient cause, for it brings things together, and a material cause, for it is a part of the mixture.\u201d And Theophrastos expressed the same idea by saying that Empedokles sometimes gave an efficient power to Love and Strife, and sometimes put them on a level with the other four. The fragments leave no room for doubt that they were thought of as spatial and corporeal. All the six are called \u201c equal.\u201d Love is said to be \u201c equal in length and breadth \u201d to the others, and Strife is described as equal to each of them in weight (fr. 17).\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Greek Philosophy|last=Burnet|first=John|publisher=A. & C.

[He posits] a god who is the cause of all: \"Always he remains in the same place, moving not at all: nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at different times... but without toil he shakes all things by the thought of his mind\"...<br><br>In ''Physics'' VIII,5, [Aristotle] speaks favorably of Anaxagoras' Mind in so far as it is \"impassive and unmixed [with the world]\"... How can Aristotle have held both that God is immanent and also \"impassive and unmixed\"? Much of his argument depends on an analogy drawn from geometry. Just as the primary locus of power and influence in a rotating sphere is its central axis, which, although it moves (transitively) the other parts of the sphere, remains quite still, so also the unmoved mover remains majestically impassive even while being the very source of the activity of the universe (''Physics'' VIII,9,265b7-8)... Aristotle rejects the notion that God might think of something other than himself precisely because this would be to diminish his power (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1074b34). The power that Aristotle is concerned about is the power whereby God has an effect in the world (''Metaphysics'' XII,6,1071b12-32). (In ''Physics'' VIII,5, Aristotle also says of Anaxagoras' Mind that \"it could only cause motion the way it does being unmoved, and it can only ''rule'' being unmixed\" -- 256b26-7: emphasis added.) So, we must conceive of God's thoughts about himself as bound up with his immanency (''Metaphysics'' I,2,983a8-10, III,4,1000b3-6). Aristotle offers an explanation of how this works: just as our (internal) intentions ''are'' their external objects less their matter, so God thinks himself in the things that depend on him (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1047b38-a5: also ''De Anima'' III,5,430a-19-20).

Flannery|\"Ancient Philosophical Theology\" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}\n\nIn chapter 10 of ''De ratione animae'', Alcuin defines ''anima'' (soul) by combining Platonic attributes, including intellect and reason, ceaseless motion and immortality with the Christian tenents of free will and salvation. As a means of interaction with corporeals such as the human body and incorporeals such as God and the Forms, his definition includes traits pertaining to the soul as an incarnate entity within the natural world.<ref name=\"Lockett2011\"/>\n{{quote|It is one thing to assert that the soul is 'incorporeal' insofar as it is distinct from the human body, and it is quite another thing to espouse the Platonic notion that the soul is utterly incorporeal, or that it is not a body of any kind. Platonic incorporeals differ significantly from the incorporeals of classical Stoicism, which were thought to participate in a diminished form of existence, and from the ''incorporalia'' of the grammatical tradition, which were defined on the basis of their imperceptibility to one or more of the five senses... A Platonic incorporeal is necessarily imperceptible to all the senses, and it does not occupy space. Accordingly, Alcuin writes that the soul is 'invisible, incorporeal, without weight, without colour,' although for a reader who already shared Alcuin's Platonic understanding of incorporeals, the mention of invisibility, weightlessness, and colourlessness was redundant. Alcuin also carefully specifies that the soul is circumscribed but nonetheless whole in every part of the body. In other words, the soul is neither diffused throughout the universe as God is or as a world-soul would be, nor is it distributed throughout a space in such a way that it can be divided.<br><br>If incorporeality makes the soul imperceptible to the senses, it is even more important that incorporeality allows the soul to apprehend other things that are imperceptible to the senses. The idea that like perceives like goes back to the Greek Presocratics, and in the medieval Latin iterations, it did not have to carry strictly Platonic connotations. Yet principally from Augustine's early dialogues and ''De Trinitate'', Alcuin and other Carolingian thinkers inherited many rational demonstrations of theological doctrines, worked out according to a method of argumentation that combined Neoplatonist metaphysics with Aristotelian logic. Within this mode of discourse, it was exceedingly useful to have recourse to the concept of true incorporeality, and to be able to attribute true incorporeality to the unitary, rational ''anima'', with all of the ontological and epistemological implications that it entails.<ref name=\"Lockett2011\">{{cite book |first=L. |last=Lockett |year=2011 |title=Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions |series=Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781442642171 |lccn=2011378491 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVycdqSh28C&pg=PA288 |pages=287\u2013289}}</ref>|Leslie Lockett|\"Why Must the Soul Be Incorporeal?\" in ''Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions''}}\n\n{{quote|Traditional forms of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam each conceive of God as an immaterial, nonphysical reality. If \"the incorporeality of God\" means the denial that God is physical, then all three monotheistic religions accept the incorporeality of God. However, if we follow the etymology of the term and define \"incoporeality\" as \"without body\" (from the Latin ''incorporale''), Christianity takes exception to a strict adherence to belief in God's incorporeality when it comes to the Incarnation. According to traditional Christianity, in the Incarnation, the second member of the Trinity... became infleshed (the Latin meaning of ''incarnatus'') and thus, in a sense, came to be \"with body.\" While this pivotal claim about the union of God and man at the heart of Christianity marks a dramatic departure from a radical transcendent theology of God according to which any such union is metaphysically impossible, it does not commit Christians to denying God's immateriality. In traditional Christianity, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son (apart from the Incarnation) are clearly understood as lacking material structure and composition. Because of the shared conviction that God is immaterial, Christians along with Jews and Muslims have historically opposed material conceptions of God or gods such as one finds in Stoicism, according to which God is a vast material being, a world soul or animal, and in polytheism, according to which there are hosts of material deities.

In [[ancient philosophy]], any attenuated \"thin\" matter such as [[air]], [[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[fire]] or [[light]] was considered incorporeal.<ref>Priestley, Joseph.

[https://archive.org/stream/matterandspirit01prieuoft#page/232/mode/2up Disquisitions of Matter and Spirit]. p. 235</ref> In modern philosophy, a distinction between the incorporeal and immaterial is not necessarily maintained: a body is described as incorporeal if it is not made out of matter.\n\nIn the [[problem of universals]], universals are separable from any particular embodiment in one sense, while in another, they seem inherent nonetheless. Aristotle offered a [[hylomorphic]] account of abstraction in contrast to Plato's world of [[Theory of Forms|Forms]]. Aristotle used the Greek terms ''[[wikt:somatic|soma]]'' (body) and ''[[hyle]]'' (matter, literally \"wood\").\n\nThe notion that a causally effective incorporeal body is even coherent requires the belief that something can affect what's material, without physically existing at the point of effect. A ball can directly affect another ball by coming in direct contact with it, and is visible because it reflects the light that directly reaches it. An incorporeal field of influence, or immaterial body could not perform these functions because they have no physical construction with which to perform these functions. Following Newton, it became customary to accept [[action at a distance]] as brute fact, and to overlook the philosophical problems involved in so doing.\n\n==In Philosophy==\n[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]] depicted by Raphael.]]On [[Empedocles]] and incorporeal, [[John Burnet (classicist)|Burnet]] writes:<blockquote>\"The Love and Strife of Empedokles are no incorporeal forces. They are active, indeed, but they are still corporeal. At the time, this was inevitable; nothing incorporeal had yet been dreamt of. Naturally, Aristotle is puzzled by this characteristic of what he regarded as efficient causes. \u201c The Love of Empedokles,\u201d he says is both an efficient cause, for it brings things together, and a material cause, for it is a part of the mixture.\u201d And Theophrastos expressed the same idea by saying that Empedokles sometimes gave an efficient power to Love and Strife, and sometimes put them on a level with the other four. The fragments leave no room for doubt that they were thought of as spatial and corporeal. All the six are called \u201c equal.\u201d Love is said to be \u201c equal in length and breadth \u201d to the others, and Strife is described as equal to each of them in weight (fr. 17).\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Greek Philosophy|last=Burnet|first=John|publisher=A. & C.

[He posits] a god who is the cause of all: \"Always he remains in the same place, moving not at all: nor is it fitting for him to go to different places at different times... but without toil he shakes all things by the thought of his mind\"...<br><br>In ''Physics'' VIII,5, [Aristotle] speaks favorably of Anaxagoras' Mind in so far as it is \"impassive and unmixed [with the world]\"... How can Aristotle have held both that God is immanent and also \"impassive and unmixed\"? Much of his argument depends on an analogy drawn from geometry. Just as the primary locus of power and influence in a rotating sphere is its central axis, which, although it moves (transitively) the other parts of the sphere, remains quite still, so also the unmoved mover remains majestically impassive even while being the very source of the activity of the universe (''Physics'' VIII,9,265b7-8)... Aristotle rejects the notion that God might think of something other than himself precisely because this would be to diminish his power (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1074b34). The power that Aristotle is concerned about is the power whereby God has an effect in the world (''Metaphysics'' XII,6,1071b12-32). (In ''Physics'' VIII,5, Aristotle also says of Anaxagoras' Mind that \"it could only cause motion the way it does being unmoved, and it can only ''rule'' being unmixed\" -- 256b26-7: emphasis added.) So, we must conceive of God's thoughts about himself as bound up with his immanency (''Metaphysics'' I,2,983a8-10, III,4,1000b3-6). Aristotle offers an explanation of how this works: just as our (internal) intentions ''are'' their external objects less their matter, so God thinks himself in the things that depend on him (''Metaphysics'' XII,9,1047b38-a5: also ''De Anima'' III,5,430a-19-20).

Flannery|\"Ancient Philosophical Theology\" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}\n\nIn chapter 10 of ''De ratione animae'', Alcuin defines ''anima'' (soul) by combining Platonic attributes, including intellect and reason, ceaseless motion and immortality with the Christian tenents of free will and salvation. As a means of interaction with corporeals such as the human body and incorporeals such as God and the Forms, his definition includes traits pertaining to the soul as an incarnate entity within the natural world.<ref name=\"Lockett2011\"/>\n{{quote|It is one thing to assert that the soul is 'incorporeal' insofar as it is distinct from the human body, and it is quite another thing to espouse the Platonic notion that the soul is utterly incorporeal, or that it is not a body of any kind. Platonic incorporeals differ significantly from the incorporeals of classical Stoicism, which were thought to participate in a diminished form of existence, and from the ''incorporalia'' of the grammatical tradition, which were defined on the basis of their imperceptibility to one or more of the five senses... A Platonic incorporeal is necessarily imperceptible to all the senses, and it does not occupy space. Accordingly, Alcuin writes that the soul is 'invisible, incorporeal, without weight, without colour,' although for a reader who already shared Alcuin's Platonic understanding of incorporeals, the mention of invisibility, weightlessness, and colourlessness was redundant. Alcuin also carefully specifies that the soul is circumscribed but nonetheless whole in every part of the body. In other words, the soul is neither diffused throughout the universe as God is or as a world-soul would be, nor is it distributed throughout a space in such a way that it can be divided.<br><br>If incorporeality makes the soul imperceptible to the senses, it is even more important that incorporeality allows the soul to apprehend other things that are imperceptible to the senses. The idea that like perceives like goes back to the Greek Presocratics, and in the medieval Latin iterations, it did not have to carry strictly Platonic connotations. Yet principally from Augustine's early dialogues and ''De Trinitate'', Alcuin and other Carolingian thinkers inherited many rational demonstrations of theological doctrines, worked out according to a method of argumentation that combined Neoplatonist metaphysics with Aristotelian logic. Within this mode of discourse, it was exceedingly useful to have recourse to the concept of true incorporeality, and to be able to attribute true incorporeality to the unitary, rational ''anima'', with all of the ontological and epistemological implications that it entails.<ref name=\"Lockett2011\">{{cite book |first=L. |last=Lockett |year=2011 |title=Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions |series=Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9781442642171 |lccn=2011378491 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMVycdqSh28C&pg=PA288 |pages=287\u2013289}}</ref>|Leslie Lockett|\"Why Must the Soul Be Incorporeal?\" in ''Anglo-Saxon Psychologies in the Vernacular and Latin Traditions''}}\n\n{{quote|Traditional forms of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam each conceive of God as an immaterial, nonphysical reality. If \"the incorporeality of God\" means the denial that God is physical, then all three monotheistic religions accept the incorporeality of God. However, if we follow the etymology of the term and define \"incoporeality\" as \"without body\" (from the Latin ''incorporale''), Christianity takes exception to a strict adherence to belief in God's incorporeality when it comes to the Incarnation. According to traditional Christianity, in the Incarnation, the second member of the Trinity... became infleshed (the Latin meaning of ''incarnatus'') and thus, in a sense, came to be \"with body.\" While this pivotal claim about the union of God and man at the heart of Christianity marks a dramatic departure from a radical transcendent theology of God according to which any such union is metaphysically impossible, it does not commit Christians to denying God's immateriality. In traditional Christianity, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, and God the Son (apart from the Incarnation) are clearly understood as lacking material structure and composition. Because of the shared conviction that God is immaterial, Christians along with Jews and Muslims have historically opposed material conceptions of God or gods such as one finds in Stoicism, according to which God is a vast material being, a world soul or animal, and in polytheism, according to which there are hosts of material deities. God's immaterial reality has also been used to articulate an important difference between monotheism and versions of pantheism... according to which the material world either is God or a part of God.<ref name=\"Taliaferro2010\">{{cite book |first=C. |last=Taliaferro |first2=P. |last2=Draper |first3=P.L. |last3=Quinn |year=2010 |title=A Companion to Philosophy of Religion |series=Blackwell Companions to Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9781405163576 |lccn=2009037505 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&pg=PA292 |page=292}}</ref>|[[Charles Taliaferro]]|\"Incorporeality\" in ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''}}\n\n===Theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n\nMembers of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Church of Jesus Christ) view the mainstream Christian belief in God's incorporeality as being founded upon a post-Apostolic departure from the traditional Judeo-Christian belief in an anthropomorphic, corporeal God.

This was apparent in the Greek's skeptical reaction to the doctrine of the resurrection in {{lds|Acts|acts|17}}, and is what prompted Paul's defense of the resurrection in {{lds|1 Corinthians|1-cor|15}}. In \u201cExpositions on the Psalms\u201d Augustine wrote, \u201cNothing has been attacked with the same pertinacious, contentious contradiction, in the Christian faith, as the resurrection of the flesh...many Gentile philosophers have...written that the soul is immortal: when they come to the resurrection of the flesh...they most openly deny it, declaring it to be absolutely impossible that this earthly flesh can ascend to Heaven.\u201d<ref>\"Exposition on Psalm 89\", Translated by J.E.

We went to the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. And I saw then this discipline and order. And I said to myself: \"Why can't we do the same thing in Lebanon?\" So when we came back to Lebanon, we created this youth movement. When I was in Berlin then, Nazism did not have the reputation which it has now. Nazism? In every system in the world, you can find something good. But Nazism was not Nazism at all. The word came afterwards. In their system, I saw discipline. And we in the Middle East, we need discipline more than anything else.<ref name=\"fisk90\">Fisk, R. (1990).

Its [[motto]] was \"[[God]], [[Nation]] and [[Family]].\"\n\nThe influence of the Phalangists was very limited in the early years of [[Lebanon]]'s independence, but came to prominence as a strong ally of the government in the [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|1958 crisis]]. In the aftermath of the crisis, Gemayel was appointed to the cabinet, and two years later, was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]].\n\nIn 1968, the party joined the [[Helf Alliance]] formed with the two other big mainly [[Christians|Christian]] parties in Lebanon: the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] of former President [[Camille Chamoun]], and [[Lebanese National Bloc|National Bloc]] of [[Raymond Edd\u00e9]], and won 9 seats (of 99) in the parliamentary elections held that year, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon's notoriously fractured political system. By the end of the decade, the party created its own [[militia]], the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]] (KRF) and soon clashes began with the rising [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant guerrillas.\n\nBy the 1970s, the party had become a political giant in Lebanon, with an estimated membership of 60,000 to 70,000. The vast majority (85%) of members were [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]], but some were members of minority Christian communities, [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiites]], [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], and [[Lebanese Jews|Jews]].<ref name=\"Husseini\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYiiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pax Syriana: Elite Politics in Postwar Lebanon|author=Rola L.

It was founded in 1937 as the \"Militants' organization\" by the President of the Party [[Pierre Gemayel]] and [[William Hawi]], a [[Lebanese-American]] glass industrialist, who led them during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|1958 civil war]].  Fighting alongside the pro-government forces, the Phalangists defended the [[Metn]] region.\n\nDisbanded in January 1961 by order of the Kataeb Party' Political Bureau, Hawi created in their place the Kataeb Regulatory Forces.  In order to coordinate the activities of all Phalange paramilitary forces, the Political Bureau set up the Kataeb War Council ([[Arabic]]: ''Majliss al-Harbi'') in 1970, with William Hawi being appointed as head.  The seat of the Council was allocated at the Kataeb Party's Headquarters at the heart of [[Ashrafieh]] quarter in [[East Beirut]] and a quiet expansion of KRF units followed suit, complemented by the development of a training infrastructure.\n\nTwo company-sized [[Special Forces]] units, the \"1st Commando\" and the \"2nd Commando\" were created in 1963, soon followed by the \"Pierre Gemayel\" squad (later a company) and a VIP protection squad.  To this was added in 1973 another commando platoon ([[Arabic]]: ''Maghaweer'') and a \"Combat School\" was secretly opened at [[Tabrieh]], near [[Bsharri]] in the [[Keserwan District]]; another special unit, the \"Bashir Gemayel brigade\" &ndash; named after Pierre Gemayel's youngest son, Bashir \u2013 was formed in the following year, absorbing the old \"PG\" company in the process.\n\nConsidered by many analysts as the best organized of all militia \"fiefs\" in the whole of Lebanon under the leadership of \"chef\" [[Boutros Khawand]], it was administered by a network of Phalangist-controlled business corporations headed by the GAMMA Group \"brain-trust\", backed by the DELTA computer company, and the SONAPORT holding.  The latter had run since 1975 the legal commercial ports of Jounieh and Beirut, including the infamous clandestine \"Dock Five\" \u2013 \"Cinqui\u00e8me basin\" in [[French language|French]] \u2013 from which the Phalange extracted additional revenues by levying illegal taxes and carried out arms-smuggling operations.\nThe KRF was also served by a clandestine-built airstrip, the '''[[Pierre Gemayel International Airport]]''', opened in 1976 at [[Hamat]], north of Batroun,<ref>Fisk, ''Pity the Nation'' (2001), p. 179.</ref> and had its own radio station '''\"The Voice of Lebanon\"''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Iza'at Sawt Loubnan'') or '''\"La Voix du Liban\" (VDL)''' in [[French language|French]] set up in that same year.\n\nIn July\u2013August of that same year, the Phalangists headed alongside its allies, the [[Army of Free Lebanon]], [[Al-Tanzim]], NLP [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers Militia]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]] (GoC), the [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] (TTC) and the [[Lebanese Youth Movement]] (LYM) in the sieges \u2013 and subsequent massacres \u2013 of [[Karantina Massacre|Karantina]], [[al-Masklah]] and [[Tel al-Zaatar Massacre]]s<ref>http://forum.tayyar.org/f8/facts-ag-tal-el-za3tar-28096/index2.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> at the Muslim-populated slum districts and adjacent [[Palestinian refugee camps]] of East Beirut, and at the town of [[Dbayeh]] in the [[Metn]].\n\nDuring the [[Lebanese Civil War#First phase of the war, 1975-77|1975-76 phase of the Lebanese Civil War]], the Kataeb Regulatory Forces' own mobilization and street action skills allowed the Kataeb to become the primary and most fearsome fighting force in the Christian-conservative camp.<ref>Abraham, ''The Lebanon war'' (1996), p. 195.</ref>\n\nAt Beirut and elsewhere, Phalange militia sections were heavily committed in several battles against [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM) leftist militias and suffered considerable casualties, notably at the [[Battle of the Hotels]] in October 1975<ref>Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, ''Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas'' (1979), p. 6.</ref><ref>O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 29.</ref> where they fought the [[al-Murabitoun]] and the [[Nasserite Correctionist Movement]] (NCM), and later at the 'Spring Offensive' held against [[Mount Lebanon]] in March 1976.\n\n==Main events==\n\n===1936\u20131943===\nIn 1943, the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon's first independence from the [[Greater Lebanon|French mandate]]. During this period, Kataeb led many social struggles to consolidate national cohesion and to promote individual liberties and social welfare. The Kataeb elaborated the first Lebanese \"labour charter\" in 1937. It was a pioneer initiative as it called for a minimum wage, a limitation of working hours and paid leaves. The Kataeb was one of the first Lebanese parties to have a solid avant-garde economic program and organized social activism throughout the country. The year of 1941 saw the creation of the first women section in a Lebanese Party. It called openly for stopping any kind of discrimination towards women. Since 1939, the Party has issued ''[[Al Amal (Lebanon)|Al Amal]]'', a leading bilingual political publication.\n\n===1943\u20131958===\nThe Kataeb Party entered the political and parliamentary scene during the late 1940s after a period in which it refrained from entering the political arena to focus mainly on the promotion of the youth and on social issues, away from the trivialities of post-mandate politics.\n\nKataeb struggled to preserve Lebanon's independence facing the growing appetite of its neighbors. The Party expanded considerably its presence throughout the territory and attracted thousands of new members, undoubtedly forming one of the largest parties in the Middle-East. Kataeb adopted a modern organization which made its fame and became its trademark. In 1958 the Kataeb was the key actor in confronting the coup influenced by pan-Arabists led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the ephemeral United Arab Republic (Egypt, Syria and Yemen), and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon's independence and liberal identity.\n\n===1958\u20131969===\nAfter having succeeded in preserving the Lebanese formula, Kataeb Party ranks grew considerably and reached 70,000 members (of a total population of 2.2 million). The Party achieved many electoral successes and became the main Christian component of successive governments. During the ministerial mandates held by its members, it made elementary education mandatory and improved the public school infrastructure. On a social level, the Kataeb Party introduced \"labor laws\" and contributed decisively in social security law. The party played a key role in promoting modern institutions that are still today the pillars of the Lebanese administrative system. including the Civil Service Council, the Central Inspection Board and many others.\n\nPierre Gemayel, leader of the party and minister of public works, gave Lebanon a large part of its modern infrastructure by completing 440 development projects during his term.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Lebanon was at its peak, and became a first-tier destination for world tourism. But what was labeled as the \"Switzerland of the Middle-East\" was a shaky construction, with the influx of Palestinian refugees after 1949 setting the stage for an ominous future.\n\n===1970\u20131982===\nIn the early 1970s, Christian leaders in Lebanon feared that the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) was increasingly operating in Lebanon as a [[state within a state]]. While it is contested whether the Palestinian presence was a cause of the Lebanese Civil War, Lebanon's political balance had been fragile since 1958 and political tensions were already running high among the Lebanese.<ref>Eugene Rogan. ''The Arabs: A History.'' New York: Basic Books, 2011. pp. 380-381.</ref> In 1975, following these developments, and coupled with the disintegration of the state institutions and the army, the country became an open battlefield.  Many foreign states were directly and militarily involved in the Lebanese conflict, especially Syria, which, under the banner of Arab solidarity, tried to impose its authority upon the country, and Israel, which invaded Lebanon [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|in 1978]]. The Kataeb Party, along with other political parties, formed the Lebanese Resistance and battled to preserve Lebanon and its independence and integrity. Driven by this ideal and the preservation of freedom and Christian dignity in the Middle East, more than 4000 members of the party died for this cause. The Kataeb Party succeeded in getting two of its leaders elected to the presidency. President-elect Bachir Gemayel, son of Pierre Gemayel and leader of the Lebanese resistance, was assassinated in 1982 when an explosion rocked the Party's headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amin Gemayel, the eldest son of Pierre Gemayel, was elected President of the Lebanese Republic.\n\nThe 1982 Israeli Judicial inquiry into the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] estimated that when fully mobilized, the Phalange had 5000 fighters, of whom 2000 were full-time.<ref>[[Yitzhak Kahan|Kahan, Yitzhak]], [[Aharon Barak|Barak, Aharon]], [[Yona Efrat|Efrat, Yona]] (1983) ''The Commission of Inquiry into events at the refugee camps in Beirut 1983 FINAL REPORT (Authorized translation)'' p.108 has \"This report was signed on 7 February 1982.\" p7</ref> From the start of the [[1982 Lebanon War|invasion]], Israeli Chief of Staff [[Rafael Eitan]] told the Phalange not to engage in any fighting.<ref>Kahan. p.10</ref>\n\n===1982\u20131988===\nDespite the turmoil caused by the civil strife in Lebanon and the raging wars that devastated the country, President Gemayel was able to accomplish many achievements during his presidential mandate. One of his first achievements was to rebuild the State's institutions and to reorganize and resupply the Army in preparation for the struggle to recover sovereignty and provide security for Lebanon.  The same efforts to liberate the country culminated in the Agreement on Security Arrangements of May 17, 1983, which was somewhat an affirmation of the Armistice Agreement of 1949 with Israel even though this agreement was never concluded because of the opposition of Syria and then Israel. Amin Gemayel called for and chaired national dialogue conferences in Geneva and Lausanne and succeeded in creating a national accord and the formation of a fully representative government. He also rebuilt the Lebanese University and laid its modern foundation, introduced many economic reforms and even started to rebuild Beirut central district. \nThe war was however still raging and Lebanon's neighbors, mainly Syria and Israel, expanded their influence in the country. On the other hand, Kataeb Party suffered a great loss with the death of its founder, Cheikh Pierre Gemayel in 1984.\n\nThe [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, almost all Palestinians, by a Lebanese Christian militia in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982. The massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of the newly elected Lebanese president Bachir Gemayel, the leader of the Lebanese Kataeb Party. The Phalangist militia was led by intelligence chief [[Elie Hobeika]]. Many of the victims were tortured before they were killed. Women were raped and some victims were skinned alive. Others had limbs chopped off with axes.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster| isbn = 978-3-643-80082-4| last1 = Austenfeld| first1 = Thomas| last2 = Daphinoff| first2 = Dimiter| last3 = Herlth| first3 = Jens| title = Terrorism and Narrative Practice| date = 2011 |pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20132000===\nIn 1990, the Lebanese War came to a close when Syrian forces maintained their grip over the entire country leading to fifteen years of occupation during which President Amin Gemayel was exiled to France and the Kataeb Party fell under Syrian influence. Organized institutions that could endanger Syrian rule in Lebanon were systematically muzzled. Christian parties paid the highest price for their resistance to Syrian hegemony and their leaders were either eliminated, exiled or imprisoned. \nKataeb spirit was however still strong between its members and sympathizers. This started to be visible in the late 1990s when Kataeb students participated actively in the student and intellectual resistance that started to be heard.\n\n===2000\u20132007===\nThe revival of Lebanon and the Party: Amin Gemayel returned to Lebanon in June 2000 and was welcomed by large crowds that filled the streets and squares of [[Bikfaya]]. Pierre Amin Gemayel was elected MP for Metn district, signalling the rebirth of the Kataeb Party. \"Kataeb opposition\" was structured and began its activities within the framework of the \"[[Qornet Shehwan Gathering|Kornet Shahwan Coalition]]\", and then through the [[Bristol Gathering]], which formed a platform for the joint Christian-Muslim opposition. Eventually, all this led to the Independence Uprising in February 2005 and on March 14, 2005 more than a million Lebanese filled the streets of central Beirut to demand Syrian withdrawal and the restoration of sovereignty. The Kataeb Party extensively participated in the [[Cedar Revolution]] and MP Pierre Gemayel played a significant role in shaping this uprising which led to Lebanon's second independence.\nSyrian troops effectively left Lebanon on 26 April of the same year, and at the same time, the Kataeb Party reunited and retrieved its historical role.\nPierre Amin Gemayel played a key role in reuniting the Party in 2006. Pierre Gemayel was assassinated on November 21, 2006, and in 2007, the Party was dealt another blow when MP Antoine Ghanem was assassinated as well.\n\n==Chronology of Main Events==\n# In 1943 the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon's independence from the French mandate and co-designed the currently adopted Lebanese flag that was adopted by the Lebanese government of the time.\n# In 1958 the Kataeb and its allies opposed the coup d'\u00e9tat by the United Arab Republic under the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon's independence and liberal identity.\n# In 1969 the Kataeb opposed the Cairo Agreement, which legitimized military operations against Israel by Palestinian militiamen in South Lebanon; prompting many at the time to refer to the South as \"Fateh Land.\"\n# The conflict between the Kataeb and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) escalated in 1975 in the Ain ar-Rummaneh [[Bus Massacre]] carried out by Kataeb militants and regarded as the starting point of the Lebanese civil war.<ref name=\"Khalaf, Samir 2002\">Khalaf, Samir (2002): Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon: A History of the Internationalization of Human Contact; New York: Columbia University Press; p. 228f</ref>\n# From 1978 until 1990, the Kataeb and the Lebanese Resistance clashed in fierce battles with Syrian Forces who were occupying large parts of the country resulting in an ongoing death toll among Kataeb members.\n# In 1982 the leader of the Lebanese Resistance and president-elect Bachir Gemayel was assassinated when an explosion rocked the Kataeb headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amin Gemayel, current president of the party, was elected President of the Lebanese Republic.\n# In 1990, the Lebanese War came to a close when Syrian Forces took control of the entire country, leading to fifteen years of occupation during which President Amin Gemayel was exiled to France and the Kataeb Party fell under Syrian control.\n# In 2005, the Kataeb extensively participated in the Cedar Revolution, which saw a cross-communal revolt against Syrian occupation. MP Pierre Gemayel played a significant role in shaping this revolution which led to Lebanon's second independence.\n# In 2006, the Kataeb Minister Pierre Gemayel was assassinated by opening fire his car at close range.\n# In 2007, the Kataeb MP Antoine Ghanem was assassinated in a car bomb explosion in the Sin el-Fil area of North Metn.\n\n==War era and decline==\nThroughout the 1975 Civil War, the Phalange Party was the most important force within the Christian camp, and its militia carried out most of the fighting as part of the Lebanese Front, the mostly Christian rightist coalition.\n\n[[File:William Hawi, Chief of the Kataeb Security Council, and Pierre Gemayel.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pierre Gemayel]] and [[William Hawi]], Chief of the [[Kataeb]] Security Council]]\nIn April 1975, four persons, among them two men close to the Gemayel family, were killed during an attack on a church inauguration ceremony by unknown attackers in the Beirut suburb of [[Ain al-Roummaneh]]. In retaliation Phalangist militias killed 28 passengers of a bus later that day, most of them Palestinian with some that were deemed to be armed that were coming back from a rally at camp [[Tel el-Zaatar]], since they suspected Palestinians to be behind the church attack. The [[Bus Massacre]] is commonly considered as the spark that set off the [[Lebanese Civil War]].<ref name=\"Khalaf, Samir 2002\"/> In the following days, the 8,01900strong party militia, the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]], together with its allies, the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers militia]], [[Al-Tanzim]], [[Marada Brigade]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]], [[Lebanese Youth Movement]], [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] and other formations, was heavily engaged in street fights against the Palestinian militias and their allies in the anti-government secular [[Lebanese National Movement]].\n\nDuring the Lebanese Civil war, many predominantly Christian militias were formed who gained support from the north of Lebanon. These militias were staunchly right-wing, nationalist and anti-Palestinian with a majority of their members being Maronite. The Kataeb party was the most powerful of these militias at the time of the Lebanese Civil war. The party later went on to help found the right-wing [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces militia]] in 1977 which played a large role within the Lebanese Civil war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kataeb.org/index.asp?stay%3D1 |accessdate=April 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611231436/http://www.kataeb.org/index.asp?stay=1 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1982, [[Bachir Gemayel]] was elected [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President of Lebanon]] by the [[Parliament of Lebanon|National Assembly]]. He was assassinated less than a month later in an operation thought to have been arranged by Syrian intelligence and was in turn succeeded by his brother, [[Amine Gemayel]]. Bachir was thought to have been radical in his approach, and hinted at possible peace agreements with Israel while trying to expel all Palestinian refugees from Lebanon.<ref>[[Amine Gemayel]]</ref> In contrast, Amine was thought to have been much more moderate.\n\nOn 16 September 1982, [[Elie Hobeika]] led the massacre of between 762 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees in the [[Sabra and Shatila Massacre|Sabra and Shatila]] refugee camps, while the periphery of the camps were under the control of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].\n\nAfter the death of Pierre Gemayel in 1984, his successors [[Elie Karame]] and [[Amine Gemayel]] struggled to maintain influence over the actions of the [[Lebanese Army]], which become virtually independent as Muslim recruits deserted and rebelled against the mostly Christian officer ranks. The Kataeb party began to decline, not playing a major role for the remainder of the war.\n\n==\"Syrian era\"==\nThe party, lacking direction, broke down into several rival factions. [[Georges Saadeh]] took control of the Party from 1986 until his death in 1998. He took a moderate position toward the Syrian presence. [[Mounir Hajj]] became the president of the party in 1999, followed by [[Karim Pakradouni]] in 2002.\nAmine Gemayel left Lebanon in 1988 after his mandate had ended, mainly to avoid a clash with [[Samir Geagea]]'s [[Lebanese Forces]] and avoid more Intra-Christian bloodshed. He returned in 2000 to oppose the Syrian role in Lebanon and to back his son's (Pierre) parliamentary election campaign (which he won). His sons Pierre and Samy, had returned in 1997 and had been working on reorganizing the popular base of the party. However his return was not welcome by the established leadership of the party who had become government puppets. To distinguish themselves from the official leadership, Gemayel's supporters started referring to themselves as \"The Kataeb Base\" or \"The Kataeb Reform Movement\". General consensus amongst Lebanese always recognized Gemayel as the legitimate Leader of the party, not because of lineage but because most of popular support.\n\n==Cedar Revolution==\nIn March 2005 after the [[Rafik Hariri]] assassination, the Kataeb took part in an anti-Syrian presence demonstration, commonly known as the [[Cedar Revolution]]. It also became a member of the [[March 14 Alliance]], along with the [[Future Movement]], [[Progressive Socialist Party]], [[Lebanese Forces]] and other minor parties. The Kataeb won 4 seats in the June 2005 elections, 3 representing the Gemayel Leadership (Pierre Gemayel, Solange Gemayel and Antoine Ghanem) and 1 representing the official leadership of the Party. However, they formed one parliamentary bloc after a reconciliation that took place in 2005. This reconciliation was marketed as gesture of good will from [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]] who deemed it was time to turn the page and give those who were unfaithful to the party principles a second chance. Practically, it was a way for Pakradouni and his men to leave the Party with as little humiliation as possible since the reconciliation deal stipulated the resignation of the entire political bureau after 2 years. This reconciliation saw Amine come back to the Party as Supreme President of the Party while Pakradouni stayed on as President. [[Samy Gemayel]] (Amine's second son) who had formed his own political ideas and identity at the time (much closer in principle and in manner to those of his uncle Bachir) was a very strong opposer of Pakradouni and his Syrian ties and thus was not a fan of this reconciliation. This drew Samy away from the party and prompted him to create a Think-Tank/Research-Center on Federalism named Loubnanouna (Our Lebanon).\n\n==Siniora Government==\nIn July 2005, the party participated in the [[Lebanese government of July 2005|Fouad Siniora Government]], with [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]] as the minister of industry. Pierre played an important role in the reorganization and development of the party. His assassination in November 2006 was a major blow to the party. Syrian intelligence and \"Fateh Al Islam\" have been accused of the assassination. With 14 March Alliance forces, the party supports the Lebanese government against Hezbollah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kataeb.org/|title=\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 - \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629|author=|date=|website=Kataeb.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2007 another Kataeb MP, [[Antoine Ghanem]] was assassinated in a car bombing. Solange Gemayel remained the party's only MP, since Pierre Gemayel's seat was lost to the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] of [[Michel Aoun]] in a special election in August 2007.\n\nIn 2007 also, [[Samy Gemayel]] and (most of) his Loubnanouna companions rejoined the Kataeb, prompting a renaissance in the party.\n\n==2009 elections==\nIn the 2009 [[2009 Lebanese general election|parliamentary elections]] the Kataeb Party managed to win 5 seats. 1 in the Metn Caza, 1 in the Beirut-1 Caza, 1 in Zahle, 1 in the Aley Caza and another in the Tripoli Caza. The victories in Beirut-1 and Zahle as well as not allowing the opposition's list to win fully in Metn were major upsets to the General Aoun's FPM who is an ally of Iranian-backed [[Hezbollah]], although the opposition's list was not 100% complete, leaving one Maronite seat vacant by purpose for the candidate of the Gemayel family. These victories enabled Samy Gemayel, Nadim Gemayel (son of the assassinated President [[Bachir Gemayel]]), Elie Marouni, Fady el-Haber and Samer Saade to join the Parliament.\nIn the first Government of PM [[Saad Hariri]], the Kataeb were assigned the Social Affairs portfolio.\n\n==The Kataeb Party today==\nSince the end of Syria's occupation of Lebanon in 2005, the Kataeb Party has attracted once again new generations and has regained its role as one of the major political actors in Lebanon. The Party has a large network in Lebanon and abroad and one cannot find a major city or town without a Kataeb presence.\n\nThe Party has an active parliamentary group and has MPs elected in nearly all major Christian constituencies such as Beirut, Metn, Zahl\u00e9, Aley and the North. Moreover, Kataeb Ministers have been particularly active in governments led by the March 14 coalition, namely in Ministries of Industry, Social Affairs and Tourism.\n\nThe Kataeb Party calls for an objective assessment of the Lebanese political system's limitations in order to guarantee the required political stability, security and economic prosperity. The series of political crises that Lebanon witnessed since its first independence in 1943 highlighted the shortcomings of the consensual and unitary system and its inadequacy with pluralistic countries such as Lebanon.\n\nDuring the 2009 parliamentary elections that saw the victory of the Party and its allies, Kataeb presented a comprehensive program under the title of \"Pact of Stability\". The vision of the Party revolves around the following main ideas:\n* Adopting decentralization in order to be closer to the citizen and guarantee basic rights and freedoms, in order to manage constructively Lebanon's cultural pluralism and to ensure development in all parts of the Lebanese territory.\n* Proclaiming the [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] of Lebanon towards all armed conflicts in the region in order to protect Lebanon from external meddling into its affairs, except for the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]].\n* Safeguarding the secular State in Lebanon and completing its legal framework to guarantee the freedom of the individual and the respect of his rights and integrity. \n* Ending the military status of several Lebanese and non-Lebanese groups such as [[Hezbollah]], Palestinian armed militias and other Islamist groups, and call for their immediate disarmament.\n* Committing to all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, primarily [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559|1559]] (2004), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1680|1680]] (2006), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|1701]] (2006) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737|1757]] (2007).\n* Rejecting any form of permanent settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon at the expense of their right of return.\n* Reforming the Lebanese Administration and adopting modern economic policies to stimulate the economy, ensure prosperity and therefore stop emigration.\n\nThe Party is also strongly concerned about the presence of Palestinian refugees with their regional and domestic ramifications. Notwithstanding that the Kataeb has recently attempted to improve the inhumane living conditions of refugees through Parliament, it remains concerned about latent or gradual attempts to force their permanent settlement in Lebanon.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the Kataeb Party unveiled their 131-point platform, in which they expressed some progressive values such as decriminalizing [[homosexuality]], abolishing [[capital punishment]], removing [[Censorship|censorship laws]], and adopting a 30% [[Women in government#Quotas|female quota system]] in the parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kataeb.org/local/2018/03/11/kataeb-party-unveils-131-point-platform|title=Kataeb Party Unveils 131-Point Platform|website=Kataeb.org|access-date=2018-05-19}}</ref>\n\n== Current Members of Parliament ==\n\n* [[Nadim Gemayel]]\n* [[Elias Hankach]]\n* [[Sami Gemayel]]\n\n== Presidents of the Party ==\n* [[Pierre Gemayel]] (1936\u20131984)\n* [[Elie Karameh]] (1984\u20131986)\n* [[Georges Saadeh]] (1986\u20131998)\n* [[Mounir El Hajj]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Karim Pakradouni]] (2001\u20132007)\n* [[Amine Gemayel]] (2007\u20132015)\n* [[Sami Gemayel]] (2015\u2013present)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Lebanon}}\n* [[Cedar Revolution]]\n* [[Political parties in Lebanon]]\n* [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]]\n* [[Najjadeh Party]]\n* [[SSNP]]\n* [[Tyous Team of Commandos]]\n* [[William Hawi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=33em}}\n\n== Other references ==\n* Denise Ammoun, ''Histoire du Liban contemporain: Tome 2, 1943-1990'', Fayard, Paris 2005. {{ISBN|978-2-213-61521-9}} (in [[French language|French]]).\n* Rex Brynen, ''Sanctuary and Survival: the PLO in Lebanon'', Boulder: Westview Press, 1990.\n* [[Robert Fisk]], ''Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War'', London: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280130-9}} (3rd ed. 2001).\n* Matthew S.

Despite being officially secular, it is supported mainly by [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholics]]. The party played a major role in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975\u201390). In decline in the late 1980s and 1990s, the party slowly re-emerged  in the early 2000s.

We went to the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. And I saw then this discipline and order. And I said to myself: \"Why can't we do the same thing in Lebanon?\" So when we came back to Lebanon, we created this youth movement. When I was in Berlin then, Nazism did not have the reputation which it has now. Nazism? In every system in the world, you can find something good. But Nazism was not Nazism at all. The word came afterwards. In their system, I saw discipline. And we in the Middle East, we need discipline more than anything else.<ref name=\"fisk90\">Fisk, R. (1990).

Its [[motto]] was \"[[God]], [[Nation]] and [[Family]].\"\n\nThe influence of the Phalangists was very limited in the early years of [[Lebanon]]'s independence, but came to prominence as a strong ally of the government in the [[Lebanon crisis of 1958|1958 crisis]]. In the aftermath of the crisis, Gemayel was appointed to the cabinet, and two years later, was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]].\n\nIn 1968, the party joined the [[Helf Alliance]] formed with the two other big mainly [[Christians|Christian]] parties in Lebanon: the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] of former President [[Camille Chamoun]], and [[Lebanese National Bloc|National Bloc]] of [[Raymond Edd\u00e9]], and won 9 seats (of 99) in the parliamentary elections held that year, making it one of the largest groupings in Lebanon's notoriously fractured political system. By the end of the decade, the party created its own [[militia]], the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]] (KRF) and soon clashes began with the rising [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant guerrillas.\n\nBy the 1970s, the party had become a political giant in Lebanon, with an estimated membership of 60,000 to 70,000. The vast majority (85%) of members were [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]], but some were members of minority Christian communities, [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shiites]], [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], and [[Lebanese Jews|Jews]].<ref name=\"Husseini\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYiiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pax Syriana: Elite Politics in Postwar Lebanon|author=Rola L.

It was founded in 1937 as the \"Militants' organization\" by the President of the Party [[Pierre Gemayel]] and [[William Hawi]], a [[Lebanese-American]] glass industrialist, who led them during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|1958 civil war]].  Fighting alongside the pro-government forces, the Phalangists defended the [[Metn]] region.\n\nDisbanded in January 1961 by order of the Kataeb Party' Political Bureau, Hawi created in their place the Kataeb Regulatory Forces.  In order to coordinate the activities of all Phalange paramilitary forces, the Political Bureau set up the Kataeb War Council ([[Arabic]]: ''Majliss al-Harbi'') in 1970, with William Hawi being appointed as head.  The seat of the Council was allocated at the Kataeb Party's Headquarters at the heart of [[Ashrafieh]] quarter in [[East Beirut]] and a quiet expansion of KRF units followed suit, complemented by the development of a training infrastructure.\n\nTwo company-sized [[Special Forces]] units, the \"1st Commando\" and the \"2nd Commando\" were created in 1963, soon followed by the \"Pierre Gemayel\" squad (later a company) and a VIP protection squad.  To this was added in 1973 another commando platoon ([[Arabic]]: ''Maghaweer'') and a \"Combat School\" was secretly opened at [[Tabrieh]], near [[Bsharri]] in the [[Keserwan District]]; another special unit, the \"Bashir Gemayel brigade\" &ndash; named after Pierre Gemayel's youngest son, Bashir \u2013 was formed in the following year, absorbing the old \"PG\" company in the process.\n\nConsidered by many analysts as the best organized of all militia \"fiefs\" in the whole of Lebanon under the leadership of \"chef\" [[Boutros Khawand]], it was administered by a network of Phalangist-controlled business corporations headed by the GAMMA Group \"brain-trust\", backed by the DELTA computer company, and the SONAPORT holding.  The latter had run since 1975 the legal commercial ports of Jounieh and Beirut, including the infamous clandestine \"Dock Five\" \u2013 \"Cinqui\u00e8me basin\" in [[French language|French]] \u2013 from which the Phalange extracted additional revenues by levying illegal taxes and carried out arms-smuggling operations.\nThe KRF was also served by a clandestine-built airstrip, the '''[[Pierre Gemayel International Airport]]''', opened in 1976 at [[Hamat]], north of Batroun,<ref>Fisk, ''Pity the Nation'' (2001), p. 179.</ref> and had its own radio station '''\"The Voice of Lebanon\"''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Iza'at Sawt Loubnan'') or '''\"La Voix du Liban\" (VDL)''' in [[French language|French]] set up in that same year.\n\nIn July\u2013August of that same year, the Phalangists headed alongside its allies, the [[Army of Free Lebanon]], [[Al-Tanzim]], NLP [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers Militia]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]] (GoC), the [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] (TTC) and the [[Lebanese Youth Movement]] (LYM) in the sieges \u2013 and subsequent massacres \u2013 of [[Karantina Massacre|Karantina]], [[al-Masklah]] and [[Tel al-Zaatar Massacre]]s<ref>http://forum.tayyar.org/f8/facts-ag-tal-el-za3tar-28096/index2.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> at the Muslim-populated slum districts and adjacent [[Palestinian refugee camps]] of East Beirut, and at the town of [[Dbayeh]] in the [[Metn]].\n\nDuring the [[Lebanese Civil War#First phase of the war, 1975-77|1975-76 phase of the Lebanese Civil War]], the Kataeb Regulatory Forces' own mobilization and street action skills allowed the Kataeb to become the primary and most fearsome fighting force in the Christian-conservative camp.<ref>Abraham, ''The Lebanon war'' (1996), p. 195.</ref>\n\nAt Beirut and elsewhere, Phalange militia sections were heavily committed in several battles against [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM) leftist militias and suffered considerable casualties, notably at the [[Battle of the Hotels]] in October 1975<ref>Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, ''Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas'' (1979), p. 6.</ref><ref>O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 29.</ref> where they fought the [[al-Murabitoun]] and the [[Nasserite Correctionist Movement]] (NCM), and later at the 'Spring Offensive' held against [[Mount Lebanon]] in March 1976.\n\n==Main events==\n\n===1936\u20131943===\nIn 1943, the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon's first independence from the [[Greater Lebanon|French mandate]]. During this period, Kataeb led many social struggles to consolidate national cohesion and to promote individual liberties and social welfare. The Kataeb elaborated the first Lebanese \"labour charter\" in 1937. It was a pioneer initiative as it called for a minimum wage, a limitation of working hours and paid leaves. The Kataeb was one of the first Lebanese parties to have a solid avant-garde economic program and organized social activism throughout the country. The year of 1941 saw the creation of the first women section in a Lebanese Party. It called openly for stopping any kind of discrimination towards women. Since 1939, the Party has issued ''[[Al Amal (Lebanon)|Al Amal]]'', a leading bilingual political publication.\n\n===1943\u20131958===\nThe Kataeb Party entered the political and parliamentary scene during the late 1940s after a period in which it refrained from entering the political arena to focus mainly on the promotion of the youth and on social issues, away from the trivialities of post-mandate politics.\n\nKataeb struggled to preserve Lebanon's independence facing the growing appetite of its neighbors. The Party expanded considerably its presence throughout the territory and attracted thousands of new members, undoubtedly forming one of the largest parties in the Middle-East. Kataeb adopted a modern organization which made its fame and became its trademark. In 1958 the Kataeb was the key actor in confronting the coup influenced by pan-Arabists led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the ephemeral United Arab Republic (Egypt, Syria and Yemen), and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon's independence and liberal identity.\n\n===1958\u20131969===\nAfter having succeeded in preserving the Lebanese formula, Kataeb Party ranks grew considerably and reached 70,000 members (of a total population of 2.2 million). The Party achieved many electoral successes and became the main Christian component of successive governments. During the ministerial mandates held by its members, it made elementary education mandatory and improved the public school infrastructure. On a social level, the Kataeb Party introduced \"labor laws\" and contributed decisively in social security law. The party played a key role in promoting modern institutions that are still today the pillars of the Lebanese administrative system. including the Civil Service Council, the Central Inspection Board and many others.\n\nPierre Gemayel, leader of the party and minister of public works, gave Lebanon a large part of its modern infrastructure by completing 440 development projects during his term.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Lebanon was at its peak, and became a first-tier destination for world tourism. But what was labeled as the \"Switzerland of the Middle-East\" was a shaky construction, with the influx of Palestinian refugees after 1949 setting the stage for an ominous future.\n\n===1970\u20131982===\nIn the early 1970s, Christian leaders in Lebanon feared that the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) was increasingly operating in Lebanon as a [[state within a state]]. While it is contested whether the Palestinian presence was a cause of the Lebanese Civil War, Lebanon's political balance had been fragile since 1958 and political tensions were already running high among the Lebanese.<ref>Eugene Rogan. ''The Arabs: A History.'' New York: Basic Books, 2011. pp. 380-381.</ref> In 1975, following these developments, and coupled with the disintegration of the state institutions and the army, the country became an open battlefield.  Many foreign states were directly and militarily involved in the Lebanese conflict, especially Syria, which, under the banner of Arab solidarity, tried to impose its authority upon the country, and Israel, which invaded Lebanon [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|in 1978]]. The Kataeb Party, along with other political parties, formed the Lebanese Resistance and battled to preserve Lebanon and its independence and integrity. Driven by this ideal and the preservation of freedom and Christian dignity in the Middle East, more than 4000 members of the party died for this cause. The Kataeb Party succeeded in getting two of its leaders elected to the presidency. President-elect Bachir Gemayel, son of Pierre Gemayel and leader of the Lebanese resistance, was assassinated in 1982 when an explosion rocked the Party's headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. In the aftermath of the assassination, Amin Gemayel, the eldest son of Pierre Gemayel, was elected President of the Lebanese Republic.\n\nThe 1982 Israeli Judicial inquiry into the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] estimated that when fully mobilized, the Phalange had 5000 fighters, of whom 2000 were full-time.<ref>[[Yitzhak Kahan|Kahan, Yitzhak]], [[Aharon Barak|Barak, Aharon]], [[Yona Efrat|Efrat, Yona]] (1983) ''The Commission of Inquiry into events at the refugee camps in Beirut 1983 FINAL REPORT (Authorized translation)'' p.108 has \"This report was signed on 7 February 1982.\" p7</ref> From the start of the [[1982 Lebanon War|invasion]], Israeli Chief of Staff [[Rafael Eitan]] told the Phalange not to engage in any fighting.<ref>Kahan. p.10</ref>\n\n===1982\u20131988===\nDespite the turmoil caused by the civil strife in Lebanon and the raging wars that devastated the country, President Gemayel was able to accomplish many achievements during his presidential mandate. One of his first achievements was to rebuild the State's institutions and to reorganize and resupply the Army in preparation for the struggle to recover sovereignty and provide security for Lebanon.  The same efforts to liberate the country culminated in the Agreement on Security Arrangements of May 17, 1983, which was somewhat an affirmation of the Armistice Agreement of 1949 with Israel even though this agreement was never concluded because of the opposition of Syria and then Israel. Amin Gemayel called for and chaired national dialogue conferences in Geneva and Lausanne and succeeded in creating a national accord and the formation of a fully representative government. He also rebuilt the Lebanese University and laid its modern foundation, introduced many economic reforms and even started to rebuild Beirut central district. \nThe war was however still raging and Lebanon's neighbors, mainly Syria and Israel, expanded their influence in the country. On the other hand, Kataeb Party suffered a great loss with the death of its founder, Cheikh Pierre Gemayel in 1984.\n\nThe [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] was the slaughter of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, almost all Palestinians, by a Lebanese Christian militia in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, Lebanon from approximately 6:00 pm 16 September to 8:00 am 18 September 1982. The massacre was presented as retaliation for the assassination of the newly elected Lebanese president Bachir Gemayel, the leader of the Lebanese Kataeb Party. The Phalangist militia was led by intelligence chief [[Elie Hobeika]]. Many of the victims were tortured before they were killed. Women were raped and some victims were skinned alive. Others had limbs chopped off with axes.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster| isbn = 978-3-643-80082-4| last1 = Austenfeld| first1 = Thomas| last2 = Daphinoff| first2 = Dimiter| last3 = Herlth| first3 = Jens| title = Terrorism and Narrative Practice| date = 2011 |pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>\n\n===1989\u20132000===\nIn 1990, the Lebanese War came to a close when Syrian forces maintained their grip over the entire country leading to fifteen years of occupation during which President Amin Gemayel was exiled to France and the Kataeb Party fell under Syrian influence. Organized institutions that could endanger Syrian rule in Lebanon were systematically muzzled. Christian parties paid the highest price for their resistance to Syrian hegemony and their leaders were either eliminated, exiled or imprisoned. \nKataeb spirit was however still strong between its members and sympathizers. This started to be visible in the late 90's when Kataeb students participated actively in the student and intellectual resistance that started to be heard.\n\n===2000\u20132007===\nThe revival of Lebanon and the Party: Amin Gemayel returned to Lebanon in June 2000 and was welcomed by large crowds that filled the streets and squares of [[Bikfaya]]. Pierre Amin Gemayel was elected MP for Metn district, signalling the rebirth of the Kataeb Party. \"Kataeb opposition\" was structured and began its activities within the framework of the \"[[Qornet Shehwan Gathering|Kornet Shahwan Coalition]]\", and then through the [[Bristol Gathering]], which formed a platform for the joint Christian-Muslim opposition. Eventually, all this led to the Independence Uprising in February 2005 and on March 14, 2005 more than a million Lebanese filled the streets of central Beirut to demand Syrian withdrawal and the restoration of sovereignty. The Kataeb Party extensively participated in the [[Cedar Revolution]] and MP Pierre Gemayel played a significant role in shaping this uprising which led to Lebanon's second independence.\nSyrian troops effectively left Lebanon on 26 April of the same year, and at the same time, the Kataeb Party reunited and retrieved its historical role.\nPierre Amin Gemayel played a key role in reuniting the Party in 2006. Pierre Gemayel was assassinated on November 21, 2006, and in 2007, the Party was dealt another blow when MP Antoine Ghanem was assassinated as well.\n\n==Chronology of Main Events==\n# In 1943 the Kataeb played an instrumental role in attaining Lebanon's independence from the French mandate and co-designed the currently adopted Lebanese flag that was adopted by the Lebanese government of the time.\n# In 1958 the Kataeb and its allies opposed the coup d'\u00e9tat by the United Arab Republic under the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, and succeeded in maintaining Lebanon's independence and liberal identity.\n# In 1969 the Kataeb opposed the Cairo Agreement, which legitimized military operations against Israel by Palestinian militiamen in South Lebanon; prompting many at the time to refer to the South as \"Fateh Land.\"\n# The conflict between the Kataeb and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) escalated in 1975 in the Ain ar-Rummaneh [[Bus Massacre]] carried out by Kataeb militants and regarded as the starting point of the Lebanese civil war.<ref name=\"Khalaf, Samir 2002\">Khalaf, Samir (2002): Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon: A History of the Internationalization of Human Contact; New York: Columbia University Press; p. 228f</ref>\n# From 1978 until 1990, the Kataeb and the Lebanese Resistance clashed in fierce battles with Syrian Forces who were occupying large parts of the country resulting in an ongoing death toll among Kataeb members.\n# In 1982 the leader of the Lebanese Resistance and president-elect Bachir Gemayel was assassinated when an explosion rocked the Kataeb headquarters in the Achrafieh area of Beirut. The architect of the blast was a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.

In retaliation Phalangist militias killed 28 passengers of a bus later that day, most of them Palestinian with some that were deemed to be armed that were coming back from a rally at camp [[Tel el-Zaatar]], since they suspected Palestinians to be behind the church attack. The [[Bus Massacre]] is commonly considered as the spark that set off the [[Lebanese Civil War]].<ref name=\"Khalaf, Samir 2002\"/> In the following days, the 8,000-strong party militia, the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]], together with its allies, the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers militia]], [[Al-Tanzim]], [[Marada Brigade]], [[Guardians of the Cedars]], [[Lebanese Youth Movement]], [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] and other formations, was heavily engaged in street fights against the Palestinian militias and their allies in the anti-government secular [[Lebanese National Movement]].\n\nDuring the Lebanese Civil war, many predominantly Christian militias were formed who gained support from the north of Lebanon. These militias were staunchly right-wing, nationalist and anti-Palestinian with a majority of their members being Maronite. The Kataeb party was the most powerful of these militias at the time of the Lebanese Civil war. The party later went on to help found the right-wing [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces militia]] in 1977 which played a large role within the Lebanese Civil war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kataeb.org/index.asp?stay%3D1 |accessdate=April 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611231436/http://www.kataeb.org/index.asp?stay=1 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1982, [[Bachir Gemayel]] was elected [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President of Lebanon]] by the [[Parliament of Lebanon|National Assembly]]. He was assassinated less than a month later in an operation thought to have been arranged by Syrian intelligence and was in turn succeeded by his brother, [[Amine Gemayel]]. Bachir was thought to have been radical in his approach, and hinted at possible peace agreements with Israel while trying to expel all Palestinian refugees from Lebanon.<ref>[[Amine Gemayel]]</ref> In contrast, Amine was thought to have been much more moderate.\n\nOn 16 September 1982, [[Elie Hobeika]] led the massacre of between 762 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees in the [[Sabra and Shatila Massacre|Sabra and Shatila]] refugee camps, while the periphery of the camps were under the control of the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].\n\nAfter the death of Pierre Gemayel in 1984, his successors [[Elie Karame]] and [[Amine Gemayel]] struggled to maintain influence over the actions of the [[Lebanese Army]], which become virtually independent as Muslim recruits deserted and rebelled against the mostly Christian officer ranks. The Kataeb party began to decline, not playing a major role for the remainder of the war.\n\n==\"Syrian era\"==\nThe party, lacking direction, broke down into several rival factions. [[Georges Saadeh]] took control of the Party from 1986 until his death in 1998. He took a moderate position toward the Syrian presence. [[Mounir Hajj]] became the president of the party in 1999, followed by [[Karim Pakradouni]] in 2002.\nAmine Gemayel left Lebanon in 1988 after his mandate had ended, mainly to avoid a clash with [[Samir Geagea]]'s [[Lebanese Forces]] and avoid more Intra-Christian bloodshed. He returned in 2000 to oppose the Syrian role in Lebanon and to back his son's (Pierre) parliamentary election campaign (which he won). His sons Pierre and Samy, had returned in 1997 and had been working on reorganizing the popular base of the party. However his return was not welcome by the established leadership of the party who had become government puppets. To distinguish themselves from the official leadership, Gemayel's supporters started referring to themselves as \"The Kataeb Base\" or \"The Kataeb Reform Movement\". General consensus amongst Lebanese always recognized Gemayel as the legitimate Leader of the party, not because of lineage but because most of popular support.\n\n==Cedar Revolution==\nIn March 2005 after the [[Rafik Hariri]] assassination, the Kataeb took part in an anti-Syrian presence demonstration, commonly known as the [[Cedar Revolution]]. It also became a member of the [[March 14 Alliance]], along with the [[Future Movement]], [[Progressive Socialist Party]], [[Lebanese Forces]] and other minor parties. The Kataeb won 4 seats in the June 2005 elections, 3 representing the Gemayel Leadership (Pierre Gemayel, Solange Gemayel and Antoine Ghanem) and 1 representing the official leadership of the Party. However, they formed one parliamentary bloc after a reconciliation that took place in 2005. This reconciliation was marketed as gesture of good will from [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]] who deemed it was time to turn the page and give those who were unfaithful to the party principles a second chance. Practically, it was a way for Pakradouni and his men to leave the Party with as little humiliation as possible since the reconciliation deal stipulated the resignation of the entire political bureau after 2 years. This reconciliation saw Amine come back to the Party as Supreme President of the Party while Pakradouni stayed on as President. [[Samy Gemayel]] (Amine's second son) who had formed his own political ideas and identity at the time (much closer in principle and in manner to those of his uncle Bachir) was a very strong opposer of Pakradouni and his Syrian ties and thus was not a fan of this reconciliation. This drew Samy away from the party and prompted him to create a Think-Tank/Research-Center on Federalism named Loubnanouna (Our Lebanon).\n\n==Siniora Government==\nIn July 2005, the party participated in the [[Lebanese government of July 2005|Fouad Siniora Government]], with [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]] as the minister of industry. Pierre played an important role in the reorganization and development of the party. His assassination in November 2006 was a major blow to the party. Syrian intelligence and \"Fateh Al Islam\" have been accused of the assassination. With 14 March Alliance forces, the party supports the Lebanese government against Hezbollah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kataeb.org/|title=\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 - \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629|author=|date=|website=Kataeb.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2007 another Kataeb MP, [[Antoine Ghanem]] was assassinated in a car bombing. Solange Gemayel remained the party's only MP, since Pierre Gemayel's seat was lost to the [[Free Patriotic Movement]] of [[Michel Aoun]] in a special election in August 2007.\n\nIn 2007 also, [[Samy Gemayel]] and (most of) his Loubnanouna companions rejoined the Kataeb, prompting a renaissance in the party.\n\n==2009 elections==\nIn the 2009 [[2009 Lebanese general election|parliamentary elections]] the Kataeb Party managed to win 5 seats. 1 in the Metn Caza, 1 in the Beirut-1 Caza, 1 in Zahle, 1 in the Aley Caza and another in the Tripoli Caza. The victories in Beirut-1 and Zahle as well as not allowing the opposition's list to win fully in Metn were major upsets to the General Aoun's FPM who is an ally of Iranian-backed [[Hezbollah]], although the opposition's list was not 100% complete, leaving one Maronite seat vacant by purpose for the candidate of the Gemayel family. These victories enabled Samy Gemayel, Nadim Gemayel (son of the assassinated President [[Bachir Gemayel]]), Elie Marouni, Fady el-Haber and Samer Saade to join the Parliament.\nIn the first Government of PM [[Saad Hariri]], the Kataeb were assigned the Social Affairs portfolio.\n\n==The Kataeb Party today==\nSince the end of Syria's occupation of Lebanon in 2005, the Kataeb Party has attracted once again new generations and has regained its role as one of the major political actors in Lebanon. The Party has a large network in Lebanon and abroad and one cannot find a major city or town without a Kataeb presence.\n\nThe Party has an active parliamentary group and has MPs elected in nearly all major Christian constituencies such as Beirut, Metn, Zahl\u00e9, Aley and the North. Moreover, Kataeb Ministers have been particularly active in governments led by the March 14 coalition, namely in Ministries of Industry, Social Affairs and Tourism.\n\nThe Kataeb Party calls for an objective assessment of the Lebanese political system's limitations in order to guarantee the required political stability, security and economic prosperity. The series of political crises that Lebanon witnessed since its first independence in 1943 highlighted the shortcomings of the consensual and unitary system and its inadequacy with pluralistic countries such as Lebanon.\n\nDuring the 2009 parliamentary elections that saw the victory of the Party and its allies, Kataeb presented a comprehensive program under the title of \"Pact of Stability\". The vision of the Party revolves around the following main ideas:\n* Adopting decentralization in order to be closer to the citizen and guarantee basic rights and freedoms, in order to manage constructively Lebanon's cultural pluralism and to ensure development in all parts of the Lebanese territory.\n* Proclaiming the [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] of Lebanon towards all armed conflicts in the region in order to protect Lebanon from external meddling into its affairs, except for the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]].\n* Safeguarding the secular State in Lebanon and completing its legal framework to guarantee the freedom of the individual and the respect of his rights and integrity. \n* Ending the military status of several Lebanese and non-Lebanese groups such as [[Hezbollah]], Palestinian armed militias and other Islamist groups, and call for their immediate disarmament.\n* Committing to all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, primarily [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559|1559]] (2004), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1680|1680]] (2006), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|1701]] (2006) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737|1757]] (2007).\n* Rejecting any form of permanent settlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon at the expense of their right of return.\n* Reforming the Lebanese Administration and adopting modern economic policies to stimulate the economy, ensure prosperity and therefore stop emigration.\n\nThe Party is also strongly concerned about the presence of Palestinian refugees with their regional and domestic ramifications. Notwithstanding that the Kataeb has recently attempted to improve the inhumane living conditions of refugees through Parliament, it remains concerned about latent or gradual attempts to force their permanent settlement in Lebanon.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the Kataeb Party unveiled their 131-point platform, in which they expressed some progressive values such as decriminalizing [[homosexuality]], abolishing [[capital punishment]], removing [[Censorship|censorship laws]], and adopting a 30% [[Women in government#Quotas|female quota system]] in the parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kataeb.org/local/2018/03/11/kataeb-party-unveils-131-point-platform|title=Kataeb Party Unveils 131-Point Platform|website=Kataeb.org|access-date=2018-05-19}}</ref>\n\n== Current Members of Parliament ==\n\n* [[Nadim Gemayel]]\n* [[Elias Hankach]]\n* [[Sami Gemayel]]\n\n== Presidents of the Party ==\n* [[Pierre Gemayel]] (1936\u20131984)\n* [[Elie Karameh]] (1984\u20131986)\n* [[Georges Saadeh]] (1986\u20131998)\n* [[Mounir El Hajj]] (1998\u20132001)\n* [[Karim Pakradouni]] (2001\u20132007)\n* [[Amine Gemayel]] (2007\u20132015)\n* [[Sami Gemayel]] (2015\u2013present)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Lebanon}}\n* [[Cedar Revolution]]\n* [[Political parties in Lebanon]]\n* [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]]\n* [[Najjadeh Party]]\n* [[SSNP]]\n* [[Tyous Team of Commandos]]\n* [[William Hawi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=33em}}\n\n== Other references ==\n* Denise Ammoun, ''Histoire du Liban contemporain: Tome 2, 1943-1990'', Fayard, Paris 2005. {{ISBN|978-2-213-61521-9}} (in [[French language|French]]).\n* Rex Brynen, ''Sanctuary and Survival: the PLO in Lebanon'', Boulder: Westview Press, 1990.\n* [[Robert Fisk]], ''Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War'', London: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280130-9}} (3rd ed. 2001).\n* Matthew S.

Despite being more known for DJ'ing, since 2006, he's been a regular presence on [[DJ Magazine|DJMag's]] Top 100 DJ surveys. Among his most notable remixes are [[Armin van Buuren]]'s \"Control Freak\", [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Dance4life (song)|Dance4Life]]\", [[Yello|Yello's]] \"[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]\", [[Sia Furler|Sia]]'s \"[[The Girl You Lost to Cocaine]]\", and [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[Marry the Night]]\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2007: Doorn Records and Best Breakthrough DJ ===\nHe established his label Doorn Records in 2007, and released his debut album [[Supernaturalistic (album)|Supernaturalistic]] on [[Spinnin' Records]]. That same year, he won the award for \"Best Breakthrough DJ\" at the [[Winter Music Conference|International Dance Music Awards]] held at the [[Winter Music Conference]] in [[Miami]].\n\nThe first big achievement in his career was securing residencies at Judgement Sunday in [[Ibiza]] and at the Gallery in [[London]]. In June 2007, he presented one of Eddie Halliwell's shows on [[BBC Radio One]]. He also did an essential mix for [[BBC Radio One]]. His productions, both original work and remixes, in 2007-2008 have generally been well received in the electronic music industry and are supported by more than 50 radio stations worldwide.
