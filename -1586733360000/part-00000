He subsequently composed ''[[An American in Paris]]'', returned to New York City and wrote ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' with Ira and [[DuBose Heyward]]. Initially a commercial failure, it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century and an American cultural classic.\n\nGershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores.

His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes. Moishe Gershowitz met and fell in love with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a furrier in [[Vilnius]]. She and her family moved to New York due to increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as soon as he could afford to. Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershowitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women's shoe factory. He married Rose on July 21, 1895, and Gershowitz soon Americanized his name to Gershwine.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=29\u201331}}\nTheir first child, [[Ira Gershwin]], was born on December 6, 1896, after which the family moved into a second-floor apartment on Brooklyn's Snediker Avenue.\n\n===Early life===\nOn September 26, 1898, George was born as second son to Morris and Rose Bruskin Gershwine in their second-floor apartment at 242 Snediker Avenue in Brooklyn. His birth certificate identifies him as Jacob Gershwine, with the surname pronounced 'Gersh-vin' in the Russian and Yiddish immigrant community. He had just one given name, contrary to the American practice of giving children both a first and a middle name. He was named after his grandfather, the army mechanic. He soon became known as George, and changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' around the time he became a professional musician; other family members followed suit.{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=10, 29\u201331}} After Ira and George, another boy [[Arthur Gershwin]] (1900\u20131981), and a girl [[Frances Gershwin]] (1906\u20131999) were born into the family.\n\nThe family lived in many different residences, as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise in which he became involved.

At about the same time, George's parents had bought a piano for his older brother Ira. To his parents' surprise, though, and to Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it as he continued to enjoy it.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=13}}\n\nAlthough his younger sister Frances was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife, thus precluding spending any serious time on musical endeavors. Having given up her performing career, she settled upon painting as a creative outlet, which had also been a hobby George briefly pursued. [[Arthur Gershwin]] followed in the paths of George and Ira, also becoming a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano works.\n\nWith a degree of frustration, George tried various piano teachers for about two years (circa 1911) before finally being introduced to [[Charles Hambitzer]] by Jack Miller (circa 1913), the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra. Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin's musical mentor, taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=14}}\n\n===Tin Pan Alley and Broadway, 1913\u20131923===\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen\n|filename=Al Jolson, George Gershwin, Irving Caesar, Swanee 1920.ogg\n|title=Swanee\n|description=[[Al Jolson]]'s hit 1920 recording of George Gershwin and [[Irving Caesar]]'s 1919 \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n|}\nIn 1913, Gershwin left school at the age of 15 and found his first job as a \"[[song plugger]]\".

He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn). He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and [[Welte-Mignon]] [[reproducing piano]]s. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into [[vaudeville]], accompanying both [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Louise Dresser]] on the piano.<ref>Slide, Anthony.

The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals ''Piccadilly to Broadway'' (1920) and ''For Goodness' Sake'' (1922), and jointly composed the score for ''Our Nell'' (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship. Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice.{{sfn|Pollack|2006|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\n===Musical, Europe and classical music, 1924\u20131928===\n[[File:George Gershwin-signed.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Head and shoulders picture of a young man with slicked back dark hair and a signature on the bottom|George Gershwin, c. 1935.]] In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major classical work, ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]] and premiered by [[Paul Whiteman]]'s Concert Band, in New York. It subsequently went on to be his most popular work, and established Gershwin's signature style and genius in blending vastly different musical styles in revolutionary ways.\n\nSince the early 1920s Gershwin had frequently worked with the lyricist [[Buddy DeSylva]]. Together they created the experimental one-act jazz opera ''[[Blue Monday (opera)|Blue Monday]],'' set in Harlem. It is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. In 1924, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]'', which included such future [[Jazz standards|standards]] as \"[[Fascinating Rhythm]]\" and \"[[Oh, Lady Be Good!]]\".<ref>{{ibdb show|title=Lady, Be Good|id=5227}}.

He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in [[Beverly Hills]].  Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table.  She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller.  The headaches and [[olfactory hallucination]]s continued.\n\nOn the night of July 9, 1937 Gershwin collapsed in Harburg's house, where he had been working on the score of ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]''.

In turn [[Maurice Ravel]] was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, \"Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing.\"{{sfn|Mawer|Cross|2000|p=42}} The [[orchestration]]s in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.\n\nGeorge Gershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, \"You should give ''me'' lessons.\" (Some versions of this story feature [[Igor Stravinsky]] rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)<ref>Arthur Rubinstein, ''My Many Years''; Merle Armitage, ''George Gershwin''; Igor Stravinsky and Robert Craft, ''Dialogues and a Diary'', all quoted in Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref>\n\nGershwin's own ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]'' was criticized for being related to the work of [[Claude Debussy]], more so than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore French styles. The title of ''[[An American in Paris]]'' reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: \"The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and ''[[Les Six]]'', though the tunes are original.\"{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=126}}\n\nAside from the French influence, Gershwin was intrigued by the works of [[Alban Berg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying \"I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already.\"<ref>Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref> (This quote is similar to one credited to [[Maurice Ravel]] during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France \u2013 \"Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?\") Gershwin was particularly impressed by the music of Berg, who gave him a score of the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]''. He attended the American premiere of ''[[Wozzeck]]'', conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1931, and was \"thrilled and deeply impressed\".<ref>Howard Pollack, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145#v=onepage&q=wozzeck%20gershwin George Gershwin: His Life and Work, p. 145]. Retrieved June 20, 2016</ref>\n\nRussian [[Joseph Schillinger]]'s influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932\u20131936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend [[Vernon Duke]], also a Schillinger student, in an article for ''[[the Musical Quarterly]]'' in 1947.<ref>Dukelsky, Vladimir (Vernon Duke), [http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIII/1/102 \"Gershwin, Schillinger and Dukelsky: Some Reminiscences\"], ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'', Volume 33, 1947, 102\u2013115 {{doi|10.1093/mq/XXXIII.1.102}}</ref>\n\nWhat set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on [[Tin Pan Alley]] into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era.

The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works. Once his musical theatre-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company's reproducing piano, including a complete version of his ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nCompared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing. His first recording was his own \"Swanee\" with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before \"Swanee\" became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920.\n\nGershwin recorded an abridged version of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Whiteman and he left. The conductor's baton was taken over by Victor's staff conductor [[Nathaniel Shilkret]].{{sfn|Peyser|2007|p=133}}\n\nGershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his ''[[Three Preludes (Gershwin)|Three Preludes]]'' for piano. In 1929, Gershwin \"supervised\" the world premiere recording of ''An American in Paris'' with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief [[celesta|celeste]] solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section.\n\nGershwin appeared on several radio programs, including [[Rudy Vallee]]'s, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the ''Concerto in F'' with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on [[transcription disc]]s and have been released on LP and CD.\n\nIn 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled ''Music by Gershwin''. The show was broadcast on the [[NBC Blue Network]] from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers.{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=163}} Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his ''Variations on I Got Rhythm'', portions of the ''Concerto in F'', and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his ''Second Rhapsody'', conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from ''Porgy and Bess'' with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935 [[RCA Victor]] asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from ''Porgy and Bess''; these were his last recordings.\n\nA 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing ''I Got Rhythm'' has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]) in August 1931.{{sfn|Jablonski|Stewart|1973|p=70}} There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on [[Kodachrome]] color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing \"Mademoiselle from New Rochelle\" and \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]\" on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of ''Strike Up the Band''. In the mid-30s, \"Strike Up The Band\" was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, \"Strike Up The Band for UCLA\". The comedy team of [[Clark and McCullough]] are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.\n[[File:George_Gershwin_USPS_stamp_1973.jpg|thumb|1973 U.S. commemorative stamp honoring Gershwin]]\nIn 1945, the film biography ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' was made, starring [[Robert Alda]] as George Gershwin. The film contains many factual errors about Gershwin's life, but also features many examples of his music, including an almost complete performance of ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nIn 1965, [[Movietone Records]] released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled ''George Gershwin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions''. The B-side of the LP featured nine other recordings.\n\nIn 1975, [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of ''Rhapsody In Blue'', accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz band accompaniment, conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The B-side of the [[Columbia Masterworks]] release features Tilson Thomas leading the [[New York Philharmonic]] in ''An American In Paris.''\n\nIn 1976, RCA Records, as part of its \"Victrola Americana\" line, released a collection of Gershwin recordings taken from 78s recorded in the 1920s and called the LP \"Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings\" (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740). Included were recordings of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano; \"An American in Paris\", from 1927 with Gershwin on celesta; and \"Three Preludes\", \"Clap Yo' Hands\" and Someone to Watch Over Me\", among others. There are a total of ten recordings on the album. At the opening ceremony of the 1984 [[Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles, \"Rhapsody in Blue\" was performed in spectacular fashion by many pianists.\n\nThe soundtrack to [[Woody Allen]]'s 1979 film [[Manhattan (film)|''Manhattan'']] is composed entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including ''Rhapsody in Blue'', \"[[Love is Sweeping the Country]]\", and [[But Not for Me (song)|\"But Not for Me\"]], performed by both the New York Philharmonic under [[Zubin Mehta]] and the Buffalo Philharmonic under [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The film begins with a monologue by Allen: \"He adored New York City ... To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.\"\n\nIn 1993, two audio CDs featuring piano rolls recorded by Gershwin<ref>[http://www.richard-dowling.com/GershwinRollsNotes ''George Gershwin and the player piano 1915\u20131927''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704123824/http://www.richard-dowling.com/GershwinRollsNotes |date=July 4, 2008 }}. richard-dowling.com.

He began his career as a [[song plugger]] but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother [[Ira Gershwin]] and with [[Buddy DeSylva]]. He moved to Paris intending to study with [[Nadia Boulanger]], but she refused him. He subsequently composed ''[[An American in Paris]]'', returned to New York City and wrote ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' with Ira and [[DuBose Heyward]]. Initially a commercial failure, it came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century and an American cultural classic.\n\nGershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores.

His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather cutter for women's shoes. Moishe Gershowitz met and fell in love with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a furrier in [[Vilnius]]. She and her family moved to New York due to increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as soon as he could afford to. Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershowitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women's shoe factory. He married Rose on July 21, 1895, and Gershowitz soon Americanized his name to Gershwine.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=29\u201331}}\nTheir first child, [[Ira Gershwin]], was born on December 6, 1896, after which the family moved into a second-floor apartment on Brooklyn's Snediker Avenue.\n\n===Early life===\nOn September 26, 1898, George was born as second son to Morris and Rose Bruskin Gershwine in their second-floor apartment at 242 Snediker Avenue in Brooklyn. His birth certificate identifies him as Jacob Gershwine, with the surname pronounced 'Gersh-vin' in the Russian and Yiddish immigrant community. He had just one given name, contrary to the American practice of giving children both a first and a middle name. He was named after his grandfather, the army mechanic. He soon became known as George, and changed the spelling of his surname to 'Gershwin' around the time he became a professional musician; other family members followed suit.{{sfn|Jablonski|1987|pp=10, 29\u201331}} After Ira and George, another boy [[Arthur Gershwin]] (1900\u20131981), and a girl [[Frances Gershwin]] (1906\u20131999) were born into the family.\n\nThe family lived in many different residences, as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise in which he became involved.

At about the same time, George's parents had bought a piano for his older brother Ira. To his parents' surprise, though, and to Ira's relief, it was George who spent more time playing it as he continued to enjoy it.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=13}}\n\nAlthough his younger sister Frances was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents, she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and housewife, thus precluding spending any serious time on musical endeavors. Having given up her performing career, she settled upon painting as a creative outlet, which had also been a hobby George briefly pursued. [[Arthur Gershwin]] followed in the paths of George and Ira, also becoming a composer of songs, musicals, and short piano works.\n\nWith a degree of frustration, George tried various piano teachers for about two years (circa 1911) before finally being introduced to [[Charles Hambitzer]] by Jack Miller (circa 1913), the pianist in the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra. Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin's musical mentor, taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts.{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=14}}\n\n===Tin Pan Alley and Broadway, 1913\u20131923===\n{|align=right\n|{{Listen\n|filename=Al Jolson, George Gershwin, Irving Caesar, Swanee 1920.ogg\n|title=Swanee\n|description=[[Al Jolson]]'s hit 1920 recording of George Gershwin and [[Irving Caesar]]'s 1919 \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n|}\nIn 1913, Gershwin left school at the age of 15 and found his first job as a \"[[song plugger]]\".

He produced dozens, if not hundreds, of rolls under his own and assumed names (pseudonyms attributed to Gershwin include Fred Murtha and Bert Wynn). He also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the Duo-Art and [[Welte-Mignon]] [[reproducing piano]]s. As well as recording piano rolls, Gershwin made a brief foray into [[vaudeville]], accompanying both [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Louise Dresser]] on the piano.<ref>Slide, Anthony.

The two collaborated on the Broadway musicals ''Piccadilly to Broadway'' (1920) and ''For Goodness' Sake'' (1922), and jointly composed the score for ''Our Nell'' (1923). This was the beginning of a long friendship. Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice.{{sfn|Pollack|2006|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\n===Musical, Europe and classical music, 1924\u20131928===\n[[File:George Gershwin-signed.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Head and shoulders picture of a young man with slicked back dark hair and a signature on the bottom|George Gershwin, c. 1935.]] In 1924, Gershwin composed his first major classical work, ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', for orchestra and piano. It was orchestrated by [[Ferde Grof\u00e9]] and premiered by [[Paul Whiteman]]'s Concert Band, in New York. It subsequently went on to be his most popular work, and established Gershwin's signature style and genius in blending vastly different musical styles in revolutionary ways.\n\nSince the early 1920s Gershwin had frequently worked with the lyricist [[Buddy DeSylva]]. Together they created the experimental one-act jazz opera ''[[Blue Monday (opera)|Blue Monday]],'' set in Harlem. It is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. In 1924, George and Ira Gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]'', which included such future [[Jazz standards|standards]] as \"[[Fascinating Rhythm]]\" and \"[[Oh, Lady Be Good!]]\".<ref>{{ibdb show|title=Lady, Be Good|id=5227}}.

On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the [[San Francisco Symphony]] Orchestra under the direction of French maestro [[Pierre Monteux]].{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=353}}  Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance.  He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in [[Beverly Hills]].  Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table.  She suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller.  The headaches and [[olfactory hallucination]]s continued.\n\nOn the night of July 9, 1937 Gershwin collapsed in Harburg's house, where he had been working on the score of ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]''.  He was rushed back to Cedars of Lebanon,<ref name=\"Jablonski\">Jablonski, Edward. \"George Gershwin; He Couldn't Be Saved\" (Letter to Editor), ''The New York Times'', October 25, 1998, Section 2; Page 4; Column 5</ref> and fell into a coma.  Only then did his doctors come to believe that he was suffering from a [[brain tumor]].  Leonore called George's close friend Emil Mosbacher and explained the dire need to find a neurosurgeon.  Mosbacher immediately called pioneering neurosurgeon [[Harvey Cushing]] in Boston, who, retired for several years by then, recommended Dr. [[Walter Dandy]], who was on a boat fishing in [[Chesapeake Bay]] with the [[Harry Nice|governor of Maryland]].

In turn [[Maurice Ravel]] was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, \"Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works and I find them intriguing.\"{{sfn|Mawer|Cross|2000|p=42}} The [[orchestration]]s in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem similar to those of Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.\n\nGeorge Gershwin asked to study with Ravel. When Ravel heard how much Gershwin earned, Ravel replied with words to the effect of, \"You should give ''me'' lessons.\" (Some versions of this story feature [[Igor Stravinsky]] rather than Ravel as the composer; however Stravinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from Ravel.)<ref>Arthur Rubinstein, ''My Many Years''; Merle Armitage, ''George Gershwin''; Igor Stravinsky and Robert Craft, ''Dialogues and a Diary'', all quoted in Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref>\n\nGershwin's own ''[[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]'' was criticized for being related to the work of [[Claude Debussy]], more so than to the expected jazz style. The comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore French styles. The title of ''[[An American in Paris]]'' reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: \"The opening part will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and ''[[Les Six]]'', though the tunes are original.\"{{sfn|Hyland|2003|p=126}}\n\nAside from the French influence, Gershwin was intrigued by the works of [[Alban Berg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Darius Milhaud]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. He also asked Schoenberg for composition lessons. Schoenberg refused, saying \"I would only make you a bad Schoenberg, and you're such a good Gershwin already.\"<ref>Norman Lebrecht, ''The Book of Musical Anecdotes''</ref> (This quote is similar to one credited to [[Maurice Ravel]] during Gershwin's 1928 visit to France \u2013 \"Why be a second-rate Ravel, when you are a first-rate Gershwin?\") Gershwin was particularly impressed by the music of Berg, who gave him a score of the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]''. He attended the American premiere of ''[[Wozzeck]]'', conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]] in 1931, and was \"thrilled and deeply impressed\".<ref>Howard Pollack, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RySwdc151ZoC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145#v=onepage&q=wozzeck%20gershwin George Gershwin: His Life and Work, p. 145]. Retrieved June 20, 2016</ref>\n\nRussian [[Joseph Schillinger]]'s influence as Gershwin's teacher of composition (1932\u20131936) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; Ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend [[Vernon Duke]], also a Schillinger student, in an article for ''[[the Musical Quarterly]]'' in 1947.<ref>Dukelsky, Vladimir (Vernon Duke), [http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIII/1/102 \"Gershwin, Schillinger and Dukelsky: Some Reminiscences\"], ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'', Volume 33, 1947, 102\u2013115 {{doi|10.1093/mq/XXXIII.1.102}}</ref>\n\nWhat set Gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice. He took the jazz he discovered on [[Tin Pan Alley]] into the mainstream by splicing its rhythms and tonality with that of the popular songs of his era. Although George Gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music, he believed that \"true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time. My people are Americans. My time is today.\"<ref name=balletmet>[http://www.balletmet.org/Notes/GeorgeG.html \"George Gershwin\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504192023/http://www.balletmet.org/Notes/GeorgeG.html |date=May 4, 2010 }} balletmet.org, (Compiled February 2000).

Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture, the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the first Gershwin Prize was awarded to [[Paul Simon]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/previews/paulsimon/ \"Paul Simon: The Library Of Congress Gershwin Prize For Popular Song\"], PBS article</ref>\n\n==Recordings and film==\nEarly in his career, under both his own name and pseudonyms, Gershwin recorded more than one hundred and forty [[player piano]] [[piano rolls|rolls]] which were a main source of his income. The majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works. Once his musical theatre-writing income became substantial, his regular roll-recording career became superfluous. He did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the Aeolian Company's reproducing piano, including a complete version of his ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nCompared to the piano rolls, there are few accessible audio recordings of Gershwin's playing. His first recording was his own \"Swanee\" with the Fred Van Eps Trio in 1919. The recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of Van Eps, and the piano is overshadowed. The recording took place before \"Swanee\" became famous as an Al Jolson specialty in early 1920.\n\nGershwin recorded an abridged version of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' with [[Paul Whiteman]] and his orchestra for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1924, soon after the world premiere. Gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the abridged version for Victor in 1927. However, a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered Whiteman and he left. The conductor's baton was taken over by Victor's staff conductor [[Nathaniel Shilkret]].{{sfn|Peyser|2007|p=133}}\n\nGershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals, some including the vocals of Fred and Adele Astaire, as well as his ''[[Three Preludes (Gershwin)|Three Preludes]]'' for piano. In 1929, Gershwin \"supervised\" the world premiere recording of ''An American in Paris'' with Nathaniel Shilkret and the Victor Symphony Orchestra. Gershwin's role in the recording was rather limited, particularly because Shilkret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music. When it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief [[celesta|celeste]] solo, Gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument, and he agreed. Gershwin can be heard, rather briefly, on the recording during the slow section.\n\nGershwin appeared on several radio programs, including [[Rudy Vallee]]'s, and played some of his compositions. This included the third movement of the ''Concerto in F'' with Vallee conducting the studio orchestra. Some of these performances were preserved on [[transcription disc]]s and have been released on LP and CD.\n\nIn 1934, in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled ''Music by Gershwin''. The show was broadcast on the [[NBC Blue Network]] from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers.{{sfn|Pollack|2006|p=163}} Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his ''Variations on I Got Rhythm'', portions of the ''Concerto in F'', and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a run-through of his ''Second Rhapsody'', conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from ''Porgy and Bess'' with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935 [[RCA Victor]] asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from ''Porgy and Bess''; these were his last recordings.\n\nA 74-second newsreel film clip of Gershwin playing ''I Got Rhythm'' has survived, filmed at the opening of the Manhattan Theater (now The [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]) in August 1931.{{sfn|Jablonski|Stewart|1973|p=70}} There are also silent home movies of Gershwin, some of them shot on [[Kodachrome]] color film stock, which have been featured in tributes to the composer. In addition, there is newsreel footage of Gershwin playing \"Mademoiselle from New Rochelle\" and \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]\" on the piano during a Broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of ''Strike Up the Band''. In the mid-30s, \"Strike Up The Band\" was given to UCLA to be used as a football fight song, \"Strike Up The Band for UCLA\". The comedy team of [[Clark and McCullough]] are seen conversing with Gershwin, then singing as he plays.\n[[File:George_Gershwin_USPS_stamp_1973.jpg|thumb|1973 U.S. commemorative stamp honoring Gershwin]]\nIn 1945, the film biography ''[[Rhapsody in Blue (film)|Rhapsody in Blue]]'' was made, starring [[Robert Alda]] as George Gershwin. The film contains many factual errors about Gershwin's life, but also features many examples of his music, including an almost complete performance of ''Rhapsody in Blue''.\n\nIn 1965, [[Movietone Records]] released an album MTM 1009 featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of the titled ''George Gershwin plays RHAPSODY IN BLUE and his other favorite compositions''. The B-side of the LP featured nine other recordings.\n\nIn 1975, [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring Gershwin's piano rolls of ''Rhapsody In Blue'', accompanied by the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz band accompaniment, conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The B-side of the [[Columbia Masterworks]] release features Tilson Thomas leading the [[New York Philharmonic]] in ''An American In Paris.''\n\nIn 1976, RCA Records, as part of its \"Victrola Americana\" line, released a collection of Gershwin recordings taken from 78s recorded in the 1920s and called the LP \"Gershwin plays Gershwin, Historic First Recordings\" (RCA Victrola AVM1-1740). Included were recordings of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and Gershwin on piano; \"An American in Paris\", from 1927 with Gershwin on celesta; and \"Three Preludes\", \"Clap Yo' Hands\" and Someone to Watch Over Me\", among others. There are a total of ten recordings on the album. At the opening ceremony of the 1984 [[Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles, \"Rhapsody in Blue\" was performed in spectacular fashion by many pianists.\n\nThe soundtrack to [[Woody Allen]]'s 1979 film [[Manhattan (film)|''Manhattan'']] is composed entirely of Gershwin's compositions, including ''Rhapsody in Blue'', \"[[Love is Sweeping the Country]]\", and [[But Not for Me (song)|\"But Not for Me\"]], performed by both the New York Philharmonic under [[Zubin Mehta]] and the Buffalo Philharmonic under [[Michael Tilson Thomas]]. The film begins with a monologue by Allen: \"He adored New York City ... To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin.\"\n\nIn 1993, two audio CDs featuring piano rolls recorded by Gershwin<ref>[http://www.richard-dowling.com/GershwinRollsNotes ''George Gershwin and the player piano 1915\u20131927''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704123824/http://www.richard-dowling.com/GershwinRollsNotes |date=July 4, 2008 }}. richard-dowling.com.
