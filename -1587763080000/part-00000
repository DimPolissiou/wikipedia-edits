On June 13, 1956, the judges determined that the state and local laws requiring bus segregation in Alabama were unconstitutional. The case went to the [[United States Supreme Court]] on appeal by the state, and it upheld the district court's ruling on December 17, 1956. Three days later, the Supreme Court affirmed the order to Montgomery and the state of Alabama to end bus segregation. The Montgomery bus boycott was then called off.\n\nFor many years, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort.

The majority of customers on the bus system were African-American, but they were discriminated against by its custom of segregated seating. She said that she aspired to be [[President of the United States|president]] one day. Colvin was a member of the [[NAACP]] Youth Council, and had been learning about the civil rights movement in school.<ref name=Adler/>  On March 2, 1955, she was returning home from school. She sat in the colored section about two seats away from an emergency exit, in a Capitol Heights bus.\n\nIf the bus became so crowded that all the \"white seats\" in the front of the bus were filled until white people were standing, any African Americans were supposed to get up from nearby seats to make room for whites, move further to the back, and stand in the aisle if there were no free seats in that section. When a white woman who got on the bus was left standing in the front, the bus driver, Robert W. Cleere, commanded Colvin and three other black women in her row to move to the back. The other three moved, but another pregnant black woman, Ruth Hamilton, got on and sat next to Colvin.\n\nThe driver looked at them in his mirror. \"He asked us both to get up. [Mrs. Hamilton] said she was not going to get up and that she had paid her fare and that she didn't feel like standing,\" recalls Colvin. \"So I told him I was not going to get up either. So he said, 'If you are not going to get up, I will get a policeman.'\" The police arrived and convinced a black man sitting behind the two women to move so that Mrs. Hamilton could move back, but Colvin still refused to move. She was forcibly removed from the bus and arrested by the two policemen, Thomas J. Ward and Paul Headley.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenhaw|first=Wayne|title=Thunder of Angels : The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the People Who Broke the Back of Jim Crow|date=2007|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2052/lib/pierce/docDetail.action?docID=10132102&p00=claudette%20colvin}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"newsweek1\">{{cite news|first=Eliza |last=Gray |title=A Forgotten Contribution: Before Rosa Parks, 15-year-old Claudette Colvin refused to give up her seat on the bus |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/187325/?gt1=43002 |quote=On March 2, 1955, nine months before Parks famously refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., a skinny, 15-year-old schoolgirl was yanked by both wrists and dragged off a very similar bus. |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401075059/http://www.newsweek.com/id/187325/?gt1=43002 |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Guardian1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/dec/16/weekend7.weekend12|first=Gary|last=Younge |title=She would not be moved|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2000-12-16|location=London}}</ref> This event took place nine months before the NAACP secretary [[Rosa Parks]] was famously arrested for the same offense.<ref name=\"Claud\">{{cite news |author=Brookes Barnes |coauthors= |title=From Footnote to Fame in Civil Rights History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/books/26colvin.html?_r=1&hp |work=The New York Times |date=November 26, 2009}}</ref> Colvin later said: \"My mother told me to be quiet about what I did.

He was light-skinned (like his father) and people frequently assumed his father was Elliot Klein who was a very prominent white male in the Montgomery community who was known for sympathizing with blacks. Elliot likely had European ancestry, among more distant ancestors.

Claudette got a job as a nurse's aide in a nursing home in Manhattan. She worked there for 35 years, from 1969 till retiring in 2004. While living in New York, she had a second son. He gained an education and became an accountant in Atlanta, where he also married and had his own family. Raymond Colvin died in 1993 in New York of a heart attack, aged 37.\n\n==Legacy==\nColvin was a predecessor to the Montgomery bus boycott movement of 1955, which gained national attention. But she rarely told her story after moving to New York City. The discussions in the black community began to focus on black enterprise rather than integration, although national civil rights legislation did not pass until 1964 and 1965. [[NPR]]'s Margot Adler has said that black organizations believed that Rosa Parks would be a better figure for a test case for integration because she was an adult, had a job, and had a middle-class appearance.

In 2016, the Smithsonian Institution and its [[National Museum of African-American History and Culture]] (NMAAHC) were challenged by Colvin and her family, who asked that Colvin be given a more prominent mention in the history of the civil rights movement. The NMAAHC has a section dedicated to Rosa Parks, which Colvin does not want taken away, but her family's goal is to get the historical record right, and for officials to include Colvin's part of history.

The case went to the [[United States Supreme Court]] on appeal by the state, and it upheld the district court's ruling on December 17, 1956. Three days later, the Supreme Court affirmed the order to Montgomery and the state of Alabama to end bus segregation. The Montgomery bus boycott was then called off.\n\nFor many years, Montgomery's black leaders did not publicize Colvin's pioneering effort.

The majority of customers on the bus system were African-American, but they were discriminated against by its custom of segregated seating.

Colvin was a member of the [[NAACP]] Youth Council, and had been learning about the civil rights movement in school.<ref name=Adler/>  On March 2, 1955, she was returning home from school. She sat in the colored section about two seats away from an emergency exit, in a Capitol Heights bus.\n\nIf the bus became so crowded that all the \"white seats\" in the front of the bus were filled until white people were standing, any African Americans were supposed to get up from nearby seats to make room for whites, move further to the back, and stand in the aisle if there were no free seats in that section. When a white woman who got on the bus was left standing in the front, the bus driver, Robert W. Cleere, commanded Colvin and three other black women in her row to move to the back. The other three moved, but another pregnant black woman, Ruth Hamilton, got on and sat next to Colvin.\n\nThe driver looked at them in his mirror. \"He asked us both to get up. [Mrs. Hamilton] said she was not going to get up and that she had paid her fare and that she didn't feel like standing,\" recalls Colvin. \"So I told him I was not going to get up either. So he said, 'If you are not going to get up, I will get a policeman.'\" The police arrived and convinced a black man sitting behind the two women to move so that Mrs. Hamilton could move back, but Colvin still refused to move.

Gayle'' made its way through the courts. On June 5, 1956, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama issued a ruling declaring the state of Alabama and Montgomery's laws mandating public bus segregation as unconstitutional. State and local officials appealed the case to the [[United States Supreme Court]].  The Supreme Court summarily affirmed the District Court decision on November 13, 1956. One month later, the Supreme Court declined to reconsider, and on December 20, 1956, the court ordered Montgomery and the state of Alabama to end bus segregation permanently.<ref name=\"Chicago1\"/>\n\nThe Montgomery bus boycott was able to unify the people of Montgomery, regardless of educational background or class.<ref>Carson, Carlborn. \u201cTo Walk in Dignity: The Montgomery Bus Boycott.\u201d OAH Magazine of History, vol. 19, no. 1, Jan. 2005, pp. 13\u201315.

He was light-skinned (like his father) and people frequently assumed his father was Elliot Klein who was a very prominent white male in the Montgomery community who was known for sympathizing with blacks. Elliot likely had European ancestry, among more distant ancestors. Elliot later admitted to being the father of the child, but nobody believed him.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Colvin left Montgomery for [[New York City]] in 1958,<ref name=\"Guardian1\"/> because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation. Similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for [[Detroit]] in 1957.<ref name=\"Chicago1\"/> Colvin said that after her actions on the bus, she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She had to drop out of college and struggled in the local environment.<ref name=\"biography.com\"/>\n\nIn New York, the young Claudette Colvin and her son Raymond initially lived with her older sister, Velma Colvin. Claudette got a job as a nurse's aide in a nursing home in Manhattan. She worked there for 35 years, from 1969 till retiring in 2004. While living in New York, she had a second son. He gained an education and became an accountant in Atlanta, where he also married and had his own family. Raymond Colvin died in 1993 in New York of a heart attack, aged 37.\n\n==Legacy==\nColvin was a predecessor to the Montgomery bus boycott movement of 1955, which gained national attention. But she rarely told her story after moving to New York City. The discussions in the black community began to focus on black enterprise rather than integration, although national civil rights legislation did not pass until 1964 and 1965. [[NPR]]'s Margot Adler has said that black organizations believed that Rosa Parks would be a better figure for a test case for integration because she was an adult, had a job, and had a middle-class appearance. They felt she had the maturity to handle being at the center of potential controversy.<ref name=Adler>Adler, Margot.

In the south, male ministers made up the overwhelming majority of leaders.

In 2016, the Smithsonian Institution and its [[National Museum of African-American History and Culture]] (NMAAHC) were challenged by Colvin and her family, who asked that Colvin be given a more prominent mention in the history of the civil rights movement. The NMAAHC has a section dedicated to Rosa Parks, which Colvin does not want taken away, but her family's goal is to get the historical record right, and for officials to include Colvin's part of history.

In 2017, the Montgomery Council passed a resolution for a proclamation honoring Colvin. March 2 was named Claudette Colvin day in Montgomery. Mayor Todd Strange presented the proclamation and, when speaking of Colvin, said, \u201cShe was an early foot soldier in our civil rights, and we did not want this opportunity to go by without declaring March 2 as Claudette Colvin Day to thank her for her leadership in the modern day civil rights movement.\u201d Rembert said, \u201cI know people have heard her name before, but I just thought we should have a day to celebrate her.\u201d Colvin could not attend the proclamation due to health concerns.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2017/02/21/claudette-colvin-honored-city-council-tonight/98197322/|title=Claudette Colvin honored by Montgomery council|work=The Montgomery Advertiser|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 a statue of [[Rosa Parks]] was unveiled in Montgomery, Alabama, and four granite markers were also unveiled near the statue on the same day to honor four plaintiffs in ''[[Browder v.

The cartoons are manic, beautifully animated, and feature amazing voice acting. Even the music tries to recapture the spirit of the originals.\" Even the characters are doing what they used to do in old 30s and 40s shorts.<ref name=\"oneofus\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|tt8543208|Looney Tunes Cartoons}}\n\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n{{Peter Browngardt}}\n{{HBO Max}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Television|United States|Cartoon|Animation}}\n\n[[Category:Upcoming animated television series]]\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American children's comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:American flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Fanta originated as a [[Coca-Cola]] substitute during the American [[trade embargo]] of [[Nazi Germany]] which affected the availability of Coca-Cola ingredients in 1940; the current version was created in Italy.
