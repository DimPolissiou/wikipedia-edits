I-95 from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] is part of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], during which it passes through the major cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].  After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the '''Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway''' and passes through [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], and [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], before exiting the state through [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border.\n\n==Route description==\n===Connecticut Turnpike===\n{{see also|Connecticut Turnpike}}\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]/[[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] town line.]]\nInterstate 95 enters the state as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line. The Turnpike stretches for {{convert|128|mi|km}} across the state, but only the first {{convert|88|mi|km}} is signed as I-95. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, going through the cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of around 150,000 throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York state line and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dixon |first1=Ken |title=Commission approves study for I-95 widening in SW CT |url=https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Commission-approves-study-for-I-95-widening-in-SW-10900695.php |website=Connecticut Post |accessdate=31 December 2018 |date=2 February 2017}}</ref> The Turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] at Exit 15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] at Exit 27A in Bridgeport (quickest way to I-84 from southwest CT), the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]]s at Exit 38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|Interstate 91]] at Exit 48 in New Haven.\n\n====Fairfield County====\n\nInterstate 95 enters Connecticut at its crossing of the [[Byram River]] into the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], where it continues southwest into [[New York (state)|New York]] as the [[Interstate 95 in New York|New England Thruway]]. Upon entering Connecticut, the highway is a six-lane freeway known as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], despite the tolls being removed from the road in 1988. The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, coming to an interchange with Delevan Avenue about a half mile from the state line. The freeway continues through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County, reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and coming to an interchange with Arch Street to the south of downtown Greenwich. The road heads in the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] where it has an interchange with Indian Field Road, before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]]. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] between the neighborhoods [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]].\n\nAfter this interchange, the freeway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and immediately interchanges with Harvard Avenue/West Avenue on the city's [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]]. The road crosses the [[Rippowam River]] and enters the dense commercial area of [[Downtown Stamford]], where it briefly becomes elevated. In this area, ramps from I-95 exist at a northbound exit to Greenwich Avenue, a southbound entrance from Washington Boulevard, a northbound exit/entrance and southbound exit to Canal Street, and a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Elm Street, the former three of which provide access to [[Connecticut Route 137]]. At this point, the freeway immediately crosses over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential [[East Side of Stamford]], where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]], adjacent to the southbound entrance ramp.\n\nAfter this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction, prior to the interchange with Noroton Avenue in the community of [[Noroton, Connecticut|Noroton]]; the southbound entrance has an outlet to the [[Noroton Heights station]] on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]], in which the latter junction is a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance.\n\nNorth (east) of I-91, the Turnpike continues along the Connecticut shoreline with a smaller amount of volume. The six-lane highway is reduced to four lanes in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] at Exit 69 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] in a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]], and continues until the interchange with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut&ndash;Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] at Exit 76 near the East Lyme-Waterford line. After Exit 76, the Turnpike continues on I-395, while I-95 continues east through New London, Groton, Stonington, and North Stonington towards the Rhode Island state line.\n\nGoing southbound, the last exit before the Connecticut Turnpike segment is Exit 80 for Oil Mill Road. The first exit northbound is Exit 81 for Cross Road. Just before the Cross Road exit is a weigh station. The road then enters [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] and intersects with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] at Exit 82. Exit 82A northbound is for a Frontage Road of I-95 and has access to shopping malls. Exit 83 differs in each direction. Going southbound, Exit 83 is for US 1 South, the Frontage Road, and the shopping malls. Going northbound, however, Exit 83 is for [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]] and downtown [[New London, Connecticut|New London]].\n\nExits 84S, 84N, and 84E, only going southbound, are for Route 32, Norwich, and downtown New London. Exit 85 is northbound only and is for US 1 North as it leaves a concurrency with I-95 over the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]], which crosses the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. Exit 86 is in both directions for Routes\n[[Connecticut Route 12|12]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|184]] in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Accessible from Exit 86 is the [[Groton Sub Base]]. Exit 87 is for [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], also known as the Clarence B. Sharp Memorial Highway. A mile after Exit 87, Exit 88 leaves for [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]] and [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]]. Just short of three miles (5&nbsp;km) later, I-95 enters [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]] and interchanges with Allyn Street at Exit 89 and [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] at Exit 90. [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] interchanges three miles (5&nbsp;km) after Exit 90 at Exit 91. Exit 92 is for Routes [[Connecticut Route 2|2]] and [[Connecticut Route 49|49]].  Route 2 East provides access to [[Route 78 (Rhode Island-Connecticut)|Route 78]], which leads to the beaches of southwestern [[Rhode Island]], while Route 2 West provides access to [[Foxwoods Casino]]. Exit 93 is the final exit before Rhode Island and is for Routes [[Connecticut Route 216|216]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|184]]. Interstate 95 then enters Rhode Island after {{convert|111.57|mi|km}}.\n\n==History==\nI-95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway\u2014to ease traffic congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]] by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the state agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway. Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of US&nbsp;1 (the turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened c. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened c. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south and west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut\u2013Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned c. 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (ConnDOT). In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ginocchio |first = Mark |title = Local Leaders Want Access to DOT cameras |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = July 15, 2007 |pages = A1, A6 }}</ref> Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated traffic and weather channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in Stratford; seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout Connecticut, which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over {{convert|11,900|USgal|l}} of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 a.m. on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n===Construction plans===\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\nInterstate upgrades include:\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018). Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007. A similar project between exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at exit 10 to exit 8. After that lane was added, a ConnDOT study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = The Advocate |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95).

[[McDonald's]] is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature [[Sbarro]], [[Panda Express]] and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015.\n\nMass transit upgrade projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County:\n*New [[Fairfield Metro (Metro-North station)|train station]] near the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]\u2013Bridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012)\n*Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed)\n*New [[West Haven (Metro-North station)|train station]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] (completed)\n*Upgrade [[overhead lines|catenary power lines]] along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s)\n*New [[Madison (Shore Line East station)|train station]] in [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] (completed)\n*Purchase new [[railroad car]]s and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability\n*Construct new [[Intermodal container|container]] [[barge]] ports at Bridgeport and New Haven\n*Expansion of [[Freight train|freight]] service on the New Haven Line\n*Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North trains\n\n==Auxiliary routes==\n*[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] is I-95's only auxiliary route in Connecticut, which runs from the junction with I-95 in [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] north to the Massachusetts state line where it meets [[Interstate 90]] / [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Scenic overlook==\n\nBetween exits 89 and 90 northbound is the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook.

I-95 from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] is part of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], during which it passes through the major cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].  After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the '''Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway''' and passes through [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], and [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], before exiting the state through [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border.\n\n==Route description==\n===Connecticut Turnpike===\n{{see also|Connecticut Turnpike}}\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]/[[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] town line.]]\nInterstate 95 enters the state as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line. The Turnpike stretches for {{convert|128|mi|km}} across the state, but only the first {{convert|88|mi|km}} is signed as I-95. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between Greenwich and New Haven, going through the cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of around 150,000 throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York state line and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dixon |first1=Ken |title=Commission approves study for I-95 widening in SW CT |url=https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Commission-approves-study-for-I-95-widening-in-SW-10900695.php |website=Connecticut Post |accessdate=31 December 2018 |date=2 February 2017}}</ref> The Turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] at Exit 15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] at Exit 27A in Bridgeport (quickest way to I-84 from southwest CT), the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]]s at Exit 38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|Interstate 91]] at Exit 48 in New Haven.\n\n====Fairfield County====\n\nInterstate 95 enters Connecticut at its crossing of the [[Byram River]] into the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], where it continues southwest into [[New York (state)|New York]] as the [[Interstate 95 in New York|New England Thruway]]. Upon entering Connecticut, the highway is a six-lane freeway known as the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], despite the tolls being removed from the road in 1988. The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, coming to an interchange with Delevan Avenue about a half mile from the state line. The freeway continues through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County, reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and coming to an interchange with Arch Street to the south of downtown Greenwich. The road heads in the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] where it has an interchange with Indian Field Road, before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]]. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] between the neighborhoods [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]].\n\nAfter this interchange, the freeway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and immediately interchanges with Harvard Avenue/West Avenue on the city's [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]]. The road crosses the [[Rippowam River]] and enters the dense commercial area of [[Downtown Stamford]], where it briefly becomes elevated. In this area, ramps from I-95 exist at a northbound exit to Greenwich Avenue, a southbound entrance from Washington Boulevard, a northbound exit/entrance and southbound exit to Canal Street, and a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Elm Street, the former three of which provide access to [[Connecticut Route 137]]. At this point, the freeway immediately crosses over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential [[East Side of Stamford]], where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]], adjacent to the southbound entrance ramp.\n\nAfter this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction, prior to the interchange with Noroton Avenue in the community of [[Noroton, Connecticut|Noroton]]; the southbound entrance has an outlet to the [[Noroton Heights station]] on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]], in which the latter junction is a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance.\n\nNorth (east) of I-91, the Turnpike continues along the Connecticut shoreline with a smaller amount of volume. The six-lane highway is reduced to four lanes in [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]] at Exit 69 in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] in a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]], and continues until the interchange with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut&ndash;Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] at Exit 76 near the East Lyme-Waterford line. After Exit 76, the Turnpike continues on I-395, while I-95 continues east through New London, Groton, Stonington, and North Stonington towards the Rhode Island state line.\n\nGoing southbound, the last exit before the Connecticut Turnpike segment is Exit 80 for Oil Mill Road. The first exit northbound is Exit 81 for Cross Road. Just before the Cross Road exit is a weigh station. The road then enters [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] and intersects with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] at Exit 82. Exit 82A northbound is for a Frontage Road of I-95 and has access to shopping malls. Exit 83 differs in each direction. Going southbound, Exit 83 is for US 1 South, the Frontage Road, and the shopping malls. Going northbound, however, Exit 83 is for [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]] and downtown [[New London, Connecticut|New London]].\n\nExits 84S, 84N, and 84E, only going southbound, are for Route 32, Norwich, and downtown New London. Exit 85 is northbound only and is for US 1 North as it leaves a concurrency with I-95 over the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]], which crosses the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. Exit 86 is in both directions for Routes\n[[Connecticut Route 12|12]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|184]] in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Accessible from Exit 86 is the [[Groton Sub Base]]. Exit 87 is for [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], also known as the Clarence B. Sharp Memorial Highway. A mile after Exit 87, Exit 88 leaves for [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]] and [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]]. Just short of three miles (5&nbsp;km) later, I-95 enters [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]] and interchanges with Allyn Street at Exit 89 and [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] at Exit 90. [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] interchanges three miles (5&nbsp;km) after Exit 90 at Exit 91. Exit 92 is for Routes [[Connecticut Route 2|2]] and [[Connecticut Route 49|49]].  Route 2 East provides access to [[Route 78 (Rhode Island-Connecticut)|Route 78]], which leads to the beaches of southwestern [[Rhode Island]], while Route 2 West provides access to [[Foxwoods Casino]]. Exit 93 is the final exit before Rhode Island and is for Routes [[Connecticut Route 216|216]] and [[Connecticut Route 184|184]]. Interstate 95 then enters Rhode Island after {{convert|111.57|mi|km}}.\n\n==History==\nInterstate 95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway&nbsp;\u2014 to ease traffic congestion on Route 1 by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the State of Connecticut agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway.  Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of\n[[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 1]] (the Turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened ca. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened ca. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]] [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the Turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south/west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned circa 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the state Department of Transportation. In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>Ginocchio, Mark, \"Local leaders want access to DOT cameras\", ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], July 15, 2007, pp 1, A6</ref>  Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated \"Traffic and Weather\" Channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in [[Stratford, Connecticut]].  Seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout [[Connecticut]], which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a 100 foot (30 m) section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport, Connecticut was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over 11,900 gallons (45,000 L) of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 AM on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his Pit Bull canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n===Construction plans===\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\n===Interstate upgrades===\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018).  Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut&ndash;Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at Exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007.  A similar project between Exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010.  An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at Exit 10 to Exit 8. After that lane was added, a state Department of Transportation study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95).

[[McDonald's]] is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature [[Sbarro]], [[Panda Express]] and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015.\n\n===Mass transit upgrades===\nThese projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County:\n*New [[Fairfield Metro (Metro-North station)|train station]] near the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]/Bridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012)\n*Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed)\n*New [[West Haven (Metro-North station)|train station]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] (completed)\n*Upgrade [[overhead lines|catenary power lines]] along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s)\n*New [[Madison (Shore Line East station)|train station]] in [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] (completed)\n*Purchase new [[railroad car]]s and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability\n*Construct new [[Intermodal container|container]] [[barge]] ports at Bridgeport and New Haven\n*Expansion of [[Freight train|freight]] service on the New Haven Line\n*Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North trains\n\n==Auxiliary routes==\n*[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] is I-95's only auxiliary route in Connecticut, which runs from the junction with I-95 in [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] north to the Massachusetts state line where it meets [[Interstate 90]] / [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Scenic overlook==\n\nBetween exits 89 and 90 northbound is the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook.

Mainly privileged elites were educated to read and write in Hanja. However, most of the population was illiterate.\n\nIn the 15th century, King [[Sejong the Great]] personally developed an [[alphabet]]ic [[featural writing system]] known today as [[Hangul]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim-Renaud|first1=Young-Key|title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824817237|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\uc54c\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \ud55c\uae00|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/setting/002.html|website=\uad6d\ub9bd\uad6d\uc5b4\uc6d0|publisher=National Institute of Korean Language|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> He felt that Hanja was inadequate to write Korean and that this was the cause of its very restricted use; Hangul was designed to either aid in reading Hanja or replace Hanja entirely. Introduced in the document \"''[[Hunminjeongeum]]''\", it was called \"''eonmun''\" (colloquial script) and quickly spread nationwide to increase literacy in Korea. [[Hangul]] was widely used by all the Korean classes but often treated as \"''amkeul''\" (script for female) and disregarded by privileged elites, whereas [[Hanja]] was regarded as \"''jinseo''\" (true text). Consequently, official documents were always written in [[Hanja]] during the [[Joseon]] era.

Neither South Korea or North Korea opposes the learning of [[Hanja]], though they are not officially used in North Korea anymore, and their usage in South Korea is mainly reserved for specific circumstances, such as newspapers, scholarly papers, and disambiguation.\n\nSince the [[Korean War]], through 70 years of separation, [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North\u2013South differences]] have developed in standard Korean, including variations in pronunciation and vocabulary chosen, but these minor differences can be found in any of the Korean dialects and still largely mutually intelligible.\n\n==Names==\nThe Korean names for the language are based on the [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]] used in both South Korea and North Korea.\n\nThe English word \"Korean\" is derived from [[Goryeo]], which is thought to be the first Korean dynasty known to Western nations. Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] refer to themselves as ''[[Koryo-saram]]'' and/or ''Koryo-in'' (literally, \"[[Names of Korea#Goryeo|Koryo/Goryeo]] person(s)\"), and call the language ''[[Koryo-mal]].''\n\nIn South Korea, the Korean language is referred to by many names including ''hanguk-eo'' (\"Korean language\"), ''hanguk-mal'' (\"Korean speech\") and ''uri-mal'' (\"our language\"). In \"''hanguk-eo''\" and \"''hanguk-mal''\", the first part of the word, \"''hanguk''\" was taken from the name of the [[Korean Empire]] ({{korean|\ub300\ud55c\uc81c\uad6d|\u5927\u97d3\u5e1d\u570b|Daehan Jeguk|labels=no}}).

Korean is also simply referred to as ''guk-eo'', literally \"national language\". This name is based on the same [[Hanja|Han characters]], meaning \"nation\" + \"language\" (\"\u570b\u8a9e\"), that are also used in Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.\n\nIn North Korea and [[China]], the language is most often called ''Joseon-mal'', or more formally, ''Joseon-o''. This is taken from the North Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the [[Joseon dynasty]] until the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]], which in turn was annexed by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nIn [[mainland China]], following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term ''Ch\u00e1oxi\u01ceny\u01d4'' or the short form ''Ch\u00e1oy\u01d4'' has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian]], whereas ''H\u00e1ngu\u00f3y\u01d4'' or the short form ''H\u00e1ny\u01d4'' is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}\n\nSome older English sources also use the spelling \"Corea\" to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language, culture and people, \"Korea\" becoming more popular in the late 1800s according to Google's NGram English corpus of 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleNGrams\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Korea%2CCorea&year_start=1800&year_end=1950&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CKorea%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CCorea%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n\nKorean is considered by most linguists to be a [[language isolate]], though it is commonly included by proponents of the now generally rejected [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Making of the Korean Language|last=Kim|first=Chin-Wu|publisher=Center for Korean Studies, University of Hawai'i|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Alexander Vovin]] (2015)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/18764127|title=\uc54c\ud0c0\uc774\ud560\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 2|last=Vovin|first=Alexander|year=2015|isbn=978-8-955-56053-4|contribution=Korean as a Paleosiberian Language|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> notes that Koreanic shares some [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features with the four [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] language families (e.g. lack of phonemic [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops, verb [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], earlier [[ergativity]]), and suggests that it actually has more in common with the various Paleosiberian language family (which is a geographical and areal grouping rather a genetic one) than with the putative [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] group.\n\nThe hypothesis that Korean could be related to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E.

Also, the doublet ''wo'' meaning \"hemp\" is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term.<ref>Vovin 2008: 211\u201312</ref> (see [[Classification of the Japonic languages]] or [[Comparison of Japanese and Korean]] for further details on a possible relationship.)\n\nAnother lesser-known theory is the [[Dravido-Korean languages]] theory which suggests a relation with Dravidian in India. Some of the common features in the Korean and [[Dravidian languages]] are that they share some similar vocabulary, are agglutinative, and follow the SOV order; in both languages, nominals and adjectives follow the same syntax, particles are post-positional, and modifiers always precede modified words.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Korean Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=29|author=Min-Sohn, Ho |year=2001}}</ref> However, typological similarities such as these could have arisen by chance.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&pg=PA109 Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006], p. 109</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=The Lost Languages of Koguryo|journal=Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies|date=2005|volume=2-2|pages=65\u201386}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Khitan language]] has many vocabulary items similar to Korean that are not found in Mongolian or Tungusic languages.

It is also one of the two official languages of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China.\n\nIn North Korea, the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences ({{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ud68c\uacfc\ud559\uc6d0 \uc5b4\ud559\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c; \u793e\u6703\u79d1\u5b78\u9662\u8a9e\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u6240}}, ''Sahoe Gwahagweon Eohag Yeonguso''). In South Korea, the regulatory body for Korean is the [[Seoul]]-based [[National Institute of the Korean Language]], which was created by presidential decree on January 23, 1991.\n\n===King Sejong Institute===\nEstablished pursuant to Article 9, Section 2, of the Framework Act on the National Language, the [[King Sejong Institute]] is a public institution set up to coordinate the government's project of propagating Korean language and culture; it also supports the King Sejong Institute, which is the institution's overseas branch. The King Sejong Institute was established in response to:\n\n* An increase in the demand for Korean language education;\n* a rapid increase in Korean language education thanks to the spread of [[hallyu]], an increase in international marriage, the expansion of Korean enterprises into overseas markets, and enforcement of employment licensing system;\n* the need for a government-sanctioned Korean language educational institution;\n* the need for general support for overseas Korean language education based on a successful domestic language education program.\n\n===Topik Korea Institute===\nThe Topik Korea Institute is a lifelong educational center affiliated with a variety of Korean universities in Seoul, South Korea, whose aim is to promote Korean language and culture, support local Korean teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural exchanges.\n\nThe institute is sometimes compared to language and culture promotion organizations such as the King Sejong Institute. Unlike that organization, however, Topik Korea Institutes operate within established universities and colleges around the world, providing educational materials.\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Korean dialects|Koreanic languages}}\n[[File:Koreandialects.png|thumb|upright=1.36|Dialects of Korean]]\n\nKorean has numerous small local [[dialect]]s (called ''mal'' ({{lang|ko|\ub9d0}}) [literally \"speech\"], ''saturi'' ({{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ud22c\ub9ac}}), or ''bang'eon'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc29\uc5b8}} in Korean). The [[standard language]] (''pyojun-eo'' or ''pyojun-mal'') of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]-era Korea for 500 years), though the northern standard after the [[Korean War]] has been influenced by the dialect of [[Pyongyang|P'y\u014fngyang]]. All dialects of Korean are similar to each other and largely [[mutually intelligible]] (with the exception of dialect-specific phrases or non-Standard vocabulary unique to dialects), though the [[Jeju dialect|dialect of Jeju Island]] is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate language.<ref>{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_interactive_atlas_adds_two_more_endangered_languages/ |title=New interactive atlas adds two more endangered languages &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref><ref>David Lightfoot, 1999. ''The development of language: acquisition, change, and evolution''</ref><ref>[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]], 1996. ''Manchuria: an ethnic history''</ref> One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of the [[Seoul dialect]] make use of vowel length, whereas speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] maintain the [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as ''z, \u03b2, \u0259'') which have been lost from the standard language, whereas others are highly innovative.\n\nThere is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, for example \"[[garlic chives]]\" translated into Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u028c\u014b.\u0261u.d\u0361\u0291i/}} ({{lang|ko|\uc815\uad6c\uc9c0}}) but in Standard Korean, it is {{IPA|/pu\u02d0t\u0361\u0255\u02b0u/}} ({{lang|ko|\ubd80\ucd94}}). This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} See also the [[Japanese\u2013Koguryoic languages]] hypothesis.\n\nNonetheless, the separation of the two Korean states has resulted in increasing differences among the dialects that have emerged over time. Since the allies of the newly-founded nations split the Korean peninsula in half after 1945, the newly formed Korean nations have since borrowed vocabulary extensively from their respective allies. As the Soviet Union helped industrialize North Korea and establish it as a communist state, the North Koreans therefore borrowed a number of Russian terms. Likewise, since the United States helped South Korea extensively to develop militarily, economically, and politically, South Koreans therefore borrowed extensively from English.\n\nThe differences among northern and southern dialects have become so significant that many North Korean defectors reportedly have had great difficulty communicating with South Koreans after having initially settled into South Korea. In response to the diverging vocabularies, an app called Univoca was designed to help North Korean defectors learn South Korean terms by translating them into North Korean ones.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Korean is virtually two languages, and that's a big problem for North Korean defectors|url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-19/korean-today-virtually-two-languages-and-thats-problem-north-korean-defectors|website = Public Radio International|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref> More information can be found on the page [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North-South differences in the Korean language]].\n\nAside from the standard language, there are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects, and they are typically partially grouped according to the [[regions of Korea]].{{citation needed|reason=This looks like something Korean popular culture tends to do for convenience, regardless of what linguists actually think.

It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}. However, the inflow of western [[Konglish|loanwords]] changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}. The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called \"initial law\" ({{lang|ko|\ub450\uc74c\ubc95\uce59}}) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.\n\nAll [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with [[no audible release]], {{IPA|[p\u031a, t\u031a, k\u031a]}}.\n\nPlosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, \u014b]}} before nasal stops.\n\n[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.\n\nOne difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}.

The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. For details, see [[Korean parts of speech]]. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element and [[word order]] is highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''A''':||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uac8c\uc5d0}}|| &nbsp; ||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uc168\uc5b4\uc694?}}\n|-\n| || ||gage-e|| ||''ga-syeo-sseo-yo''\n|-\n| || ||store + [location marker ({{lang|ko|\uc5d0}})]|| ||[go (verb root) ({{lang|ko|\uac00}})] + [honorific ({{lang|ko|\uc2dc}})] + [conjugated (contraction rule)({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [past ({{lang|ko|\u3146}})] + [conjunctive ({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [polite marker ({{lang|ko|\uc694}})]\n|}\n:\"Did [you] go to the store?\" (\"you\" implied in conversation)\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''B''': ||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uc608.}} (or {{lang|ko|\ub124.}})\n|-\n| || ||''ye'' (or ''ne'')\n|-\n| || ||yes\n|}\n:\"Yes.\"\n\n===Speech levels and honorifics===\n{{Main|Korean speech levels|Korean honorifics}}\n\nThe relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean grammar. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in ''[[honorific]]s'', whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in ''speech level''.\n\n====Honorifics====\nWhen talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee, or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences.\n\nHonorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status. For example, older people, teachers, and employers.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\">{{cite book | last = Sohn | first = Ho-Min | title = Korean Language in Culture and Society | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2694-9 |ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n====Speech levels====\nThere are seven verb [[paradigm]]s or [[Korean speech levels|''speech levels'' in Korean]], and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Choo|first=Miho |date=2008 |title=Using Korean: A Guide to Contemporary Usage |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=3 |isbn=978-1-139-47139-8}}</ref> Unlike [[honorifics]]\u2014which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person spoken of) \u2014''speech levels'' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (the person spoken to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the verb {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\ud558\ub2e4|\ud558\ub2e4]]}} (''hada'', \"do\") in each level, plus the suffix {{lang|ko|\uccb4}} (\"che\", [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|\u9ad4}}), which means \"style\".\n\nThe three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as ''jondaenmal'' ({{lang|ko|\uc874\ub313\ub9d0}}), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are ''banmal'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}) in Korean. The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor impolite.\n\nNowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}). This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" />\n\n==Gender==\nIn general, Korean lacks grammatical gender.  As one of the few exceptions, the third-person singular pronoun has two different forms: \uadf8 ''geu'' (male) and \uadf8\ub140 ''geunyeo'' (female). Before \uadf8\ub140 were invented in need of translating 'she' into Korean, \uadf8 was the only one third-person singular pronoun, and had no grammatical gender.\n\nHowever, one can still find stronger contrasts between the sexes within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone's mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a ''sajang'' is a company president and ''y\u014fsajang'' is a female company president.); (4) females sometimes using more [[tag question]]s and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech from children.<ref>Cho, Young A. ''Gender Differences in Korean Speech.'' Korean Language in Culture and Society. Ed. Ho-min Sohn. University of Hawaii Press, 2006. pp. 189\u201398.</ref>\n\nBetween two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference.<ref>Kim, Minju. \"Cross Adoption of language between different genders: The case of the Korean kinship terms hyeng and enni.\" Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Women and Language Conference. Berkeley: Berkeley Women and Language Group. 1999.</ref> In traditional Korean society, women have long been in disadvantaged positions. Korean social structure traditionally was a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasized the maintenance of family lines. This structure has tended to separate the roles of women from those of men.<ref>Palley, Marian Lief. \"Women\u2019s Status in South Korea: Tradition and Change.\" Asian Survey, Vol 30 No. 12. December 1990. pp. 1136\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. A significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]],<ref name=Sohn>Sohn, Ho-Min. ''The Korean Language'' (Section 1.5.3 \"Korean vocabulary\", pp. 12\u201313), Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-36943-6}}.</ref> either\n* directly borrowed from [[written Chinese]], or\n* coined in Korea or Japan using [[Chinese characters]],\n\nThe exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50\u201360%.<ref name=Sohn /> Later, the same author (2006, p.&nbsp;5) gives an even higher estimate of 65%.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary ''Urimal Keun Sajeon'', asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=The Hankyoreh|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/religion/376204.html|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11|script-title=ko:\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0 70%\uac00 \ud55c\uc790\ub9d0? \uc77c\uc81c\uac00 \uc65c\uace1\ud55c \uac70\ub77c\ub124|trans-title=Our language is 70% hanja?

It is similar to that of English \u2014 native English words and Latinate equivalents such as ''water-aqua'', ''fire-flame'', ''sea-marine'', ''two-dual'', ''sun-solar'', ''star-stellar''. Therefore, just like other Korean words, Korean has two sets of [[Korean numerals|numeral systems]]. However, unlike English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and Chinese are [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically unrelated]] and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean [[morpheme]]s are [[Monosyllabic language|monosyllabic]] as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English. To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and other languages.<ref>A History of the Korean Language - Lee and Ramsey\n\nhttp://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/KOREAN/Lee%20Ramsey_A%20history%20of%20the%20korean%20language.pdf</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].<ref name=Sohn /> Many words have also been borrowed from [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] via [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ub974\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8}} (''[[wikt:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|areubaiteu]]'') \"part-time job\", {{lang|ko|\uc54c\ub808\ub974\uae30}} (''allereugi'') \"allergy\", {{lang|ko|\uae30\ube0c\uc2a4}} (''gibseu'' or ''gibuseu'') \"plaster cast used for broken bones\"). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example \"dozen\"&nbsp;> {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9}} ''d\u0101su''&nbsp;> {{lang|ko|\ub2e4\uc2a4}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current \"Hangulization\" rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as \"German(y)\" (see [[Names of Germany#Korean|names of Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Deutschland'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0254\u028f\u032ft\u0361\u0283.lant]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja|\u7368\u9038}} <!-- ky\u016bjitai, no \u72ec please --> ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\u7368|\u7368]]}}&nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9038|\u9038]]}}&nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:\ub3c5\uc77c|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented \"Hangeulizations\" of the countries' endonyms or English names.\n\nBecause of such a prevalence of English in modern South Korean culture and society, [[lexical borrowing]] is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or '[[Konglish]]' ({{lang|ko|\ucf69\uae00\ub9ac\uc26c}}), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary).<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> However, due to North Korea's isolation, such influence is lacking in North Korean speech.\n\nKorean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange to native English speakers. For example, ''fighting'' ({{lang|ko|\ud654\uc774\ud305 / \ud30c\uc774\ud305}}) is a term of encouragement like 'come on'/'go (on)' in English. Something that is 'service' ({{lang|ko|\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4}}) is free or 'on the house'. A building referred to as an 'aparteu' ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8}}) is an 'apartment' (but in fact refers to a residence more akin to a condominium) and a type of pencil that is called a 'sharp' ({{lang|ko|\uc0e4\ud504}}) is a mechanical pencil. Like other borrowings, many of these idiosyncrasies, including all the examples listed above, appear to be imported into Korean via Japanese, or influenced by Japanese. Many English words introduced via Japanese pronunciation have been reformed as in \uba5c\ub860 (melon) which was once called \uba54\ub860 (meron) as in Japanese.\n\nNorth Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North. In the early years, the North Korean government tried to eliminate Sino-Korean words. Consequently, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which are not in North Korean.\n\n==Writing system==\n[[File:Yeongdong Expressway Entrance Sign in Wonju Interchange.JPG|left|upright=1.36|thumb|The [[Latin alphabet]] used for foreigners in South Korea]]\n{{Korean writing}}\n{{Main|Hangul|Korean Braille|Hanja}}\n{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}\n\nBefore the creation of [[Hangul|the modern Korean alphabet]], known as Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea and as Hangul in South Korea, people in Korea (known as [[Joseon]] at the time) primarily wrote using [[Classical Chinese]] alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including [[Idu script|idu]], [[hyangchal]], [[gugyeol]], and gakpil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hannas|first1=Wm C.|title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangping|title=Multilingual Access and Services for Digital Collections|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3955-9|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|date=2016-01-18}}</ref><ref name=\"phonetic\">{{cite journal|title=Invest Korea Journal|date=1 January 2005|volume= 23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00a2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency|language=en|quote=They later devised three different systems for writing Korean with Chinese characters: Hyangchal, Gukyeol and Idu.

Mainly privileged elites were educated to read and write in Hanja. However, most of the population was illiterate.\n\nIn the 15th century, King [[Sejong the Great]] personally developed an [[alphabet]]ic [[featural writing system]] known today as [[Hangul]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim-Renaud|first1=Young-Key|title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824817237|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\uc54c\uace0 \uc2f6\uc740 \ud55c\uae00|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/setting/002.html|website=\uad6d\ub9bd\uad6d\uc5b4\uc6d0|publisher=National Institute of Korean Language|accessdate=4 December 2017}}</ref> He felt that Hanja was inadequate to write Korean and that this was the cause of its very restricted use; Hangul was designed to either aid in reading Hanja or replace Hanja entirely. Introduced in the document \"''[[Hunminjeongeum]]''\", it was called \"''eonmun''\" (colloquial script) and quickly spread nationwide to increase literacy in Korea. [[Hangul]] was widely used by all the Korean classes but often treated as \"''amkeul''\" (script for female) and disregarded by privileged elites, whereas [[Hanja]] was regarded as \"''jinseo''\" (true text). Consequently, official documents were always written in [[Hanja]] during the [[Joseon]] era.

Neither South Korea or North Korea opposes the learning of [[Hanja]], though they are not officially used in North Korea anymore, and their usage in South Korea is mainly reserved for specific circumstances, such as newspapers, scholarly papers, and disambiguation.\n\nSince the [[Korean War]], through 70 years of separation, [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North\u2013South differences]] have developed in standard Korean, including variations in pronunciation and vocabulary chosen, but these minor differences can be found in any of the Korean dialects and still largely mutually intelligible.\n\n==Names==\nThe Korean names for the language are based on the [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]] used in both South Korea and North Korea.\n\nThe English word \"Korean\" is derived from [[Goryeo]], which is thought to be the first Korean dynasty known to Western nations. Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] refer to themselves as ''[[Koryo-saram]]'' and/or ''Koryo-in'' (literally, \"[[Names of Korea#Goryeo|Koryo/Goryeo]] person(s)\"), and call the language ''[[Koryo-mal]].''\n\nIn South Korea, the Korean language is referred to by many names including ''hanguk-eo'' (\"Korean language\"), ''hanguk-mal'' (\"Korean speech\") and ''uri-mal'' (\"our language\"). In \"''hanguk-eo''\" and \"''hanguk-mal''\", the first part of the word, \"''hanguk''\" was taken from the name of the [[Korean Empire]] ({{korean|\ub300\ud55c\uc81c\uad6d|\u5927\u97d3\u5e1d\u570b|Daehan Jeguk|labels=no}}). The \"''Han''\" (\u97d3) in ''Hanguk'' and ''Daehan Jeguk'' is derived from [[Samhan]], in reference to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] (not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula),<ref>{{cite web |last1=\uc774\uae30\ud658 |title=[\uc774\uae30\ud658\uc758 \ud754\uc801\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac]\uad6d\ud638\ub17c\uc7c1\uc758 \uc804\ub9d0\u2026\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d\uc774\ub0d0 \uace0\ub824\uacf5\ud654\uad6d\uc774\ub0d0 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201708300913001&code=960100&www |website=\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38 |publisher=The Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |date=30 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=\uc774\ub355\uc77c |title=[\uc774\ub355\uc77c \uc0ac\ub791] \ub300~\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=\uc870\uc120\ub2f7\ucef4 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}</ref> while \"''-eo''\" and \"''-mal''\" mean \"language\" and \"speech\", respectively. Korean is also simply referred to as ''guk-eo'', literally \"national language\". This name is based on the same [[Hanja|Han characters]], meaning \"nation\" + \"language\" (\"\u570b\u8a9e\"), that are also used in Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.\n\nIn North Korea and [[China]], the language is most often called ''Joseon-mal'', or more formally, ''Joseon-o''. This is taken from the North Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the [[Joseon dynasty]] until the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]], which in turn was annexed by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\nIn [[mainland China]], following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term ''Ch\u00e1oxi\u01ceny\u01d4'' or the short form ''Ch\u00e1oy\u01d4'' has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture|Yanbian]], whereas ''H\u00e1ngu\u00f3y\u01d4'' or the short form ''H\u00e1ny\u01d4'' is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}\n\nSome older English sources also use the spelling \"Corea\" to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language, culture and people, \"Korea\" becoming more popular in the late 1800s according to Google's NGram English corpus of 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleNGrams\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Korea%2CCorea&year_start=1800&year_end=1950&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CKorea%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CCorea%3B%2Cc0|title=Google Ngram Viewer}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n\nKorean is considered by most linguists to be a [[language isolate]], though it is commonly included by proponents of the now generally rejected [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] family.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Making of the Korean Language|last=Kim|first=Chin-Wu|publisher=Center for Korean Studies, University of Hawai'i|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> [[Alexander Vovin]] (2015)<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/18764127|title=\uc54c\ud0c0\uc774\ud560\uc2dc\ub9ac\uc988 2|last=Vovin|first=Alexander|year=2015|isbn=978-8-955-56053-4|contribution=Korean as a Paleosiberian Language|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> notes that Koreanic shares some [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features with the four [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] language families (e.g. lack of phonemic [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops, verb [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], earlier [[ergativity]]), and suggests that it actually has more in common with the various Paleosiberian language family (which is a geographical and areal grouping rather a genetic one) than with the putative [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] group.\n\nThe hypothesis that Korean could be related to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E.

Also, the doublet ''wo'' meaning \"hemp\" is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term.<ref>Vovin 2008: 211\u201312</ref> (see [[Classification of the Japonic languages]] or [[Comparison of Japanese and Korean]] for further details on a possible relationship.)\n\nAnother lesser-known theory is the [[Dravido-Korean languages]] theory which suggests a relation with Dravidian in India. Some of the common features in the Korean and [[Dravidian languages]] are that they share some similar vocabulary, are agglutinative, and follow the SOV order; in both languages, nominals and adjectives follow the same syntax, particles are post-positional, and modifiers always precede modified words.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Korean Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=29|author=Min-Sohn, Ho |year=2001}}</ref> However, typological similarities such as these could have arisen by chance.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&pg=PA109 Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006], p. 109</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Janhunen|first1=Juha|title=The Lost Languages of Koguryo|journal=Journal of Inner and East Asian Studies|date=2005|volume=2-2|pages=65\u201386}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Khitan language]] has many vocabulary items similar to Korean that are not found in Mongolian or Tungusic languages.

It is also one of the two official languages of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China.\n\nIn North Korea, the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences ({{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ud68c\uacfc\ud559\uc6d0 \uc5b4\ud559\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c; \u793e\u6703\u79d1\u5b78\u9662\u8a9e\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u6240}}, ''Sahoe Gwahagweon Eohag Yeonguso''). In South Korea, the regulatory body for Korean is the [[Seoul]]-based [[National Institute of the Korean Language]], which was created by presidential decree on January 23, 1991.\n\n===King Sejong Institute===\nEstablished pursuant to Article 9, Section 2, of the Framework Act on the National Language, the [[King Sejong Institute]] is a public institution set up to coordinate the government's project of propagating Korean language and culture; it also supports the King Sejong Institute, which is the institution's overseas branch. The King Sejong Institute was established in response to:\n\n* An increase in the demand for Korean language education;\n* a rapid increase in Korean language education thanks to the spread of [[hallyu]], an increase in international marriage, the expansion of Korean enterprises into overseas markets, and enforcement of employment licensing system;\n* the need for a government-sanctioned Korean language educational institution;\n* the need for general support for overseas Korean language education based on a successful domestic language education program.\n\n===Topik Korea Institute===\nThe Topik Korea Institute is a lifelong educational center affiliated with a variety of Korean universities in Seoul, South Korea, whose aim is to promote Korean language and culture, support local Korean teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural exchanges.\n\nThe institute is sometimes compared to language and culture promotion organizations such as the King Sejong Institute. Unlike that organization, however, Topik Korea Institutes operate within established universities and colleges around the world, providing educational materials.\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Korean dialects|Koreanic languages}}\n[[File:Koreandialects.png|thumb|upright=1.36|Dialects of Korean]]\n\nKorean has numerous small local [[dialect]]s (called ''mal'' ({{lang|ko|\ub9d0}}) [literally \"speech\"], ''saturi'' ({{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ud22c\ub9ac}}), or ''bang'eon'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc29\uc5b8}} in Korean). The [[standard language]] (''pyojun-eo'' or ''pyojun-mal'') of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]-era Korea for 500 years), though the northern standard after the [[Korean War]] has been influenced by the dialect of [[Pyongyang|P'y\u014fngyang]]. All dialects of Korean are similar to each other and largely [[mutually intelligible]] (with the exception of dialect-specific phrases or non-Standard vocabulary unique to dialects), though the [[Jeju dialect|dialect of Jeju Island]] is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate language.<ref>{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_interactive_atlas_adds_two_more_endangered_languages/ |title=New interactive atlas adds two more endangered languages &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref><ref>David Lightfoot, 1999. ''The development of language: acquisition, change, and evolution''</ref><ref>[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]], 1996. ''Manchuria: an ethnic history''</ref> One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of the [[Seoul dialect]] make use of vowel length, whereas speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] maintain the [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as ''z, \u03b2, \u0259'') which have been lost from the standard language, whereas others are highly innovative.\n\nThere is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, for example \"[[garlic chives]]\" translated into Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0255\u028c\u014b.\u0261u.d\u0361\u0291i/}} ({{lang|ko|\uc815\uad6c\uc9c0}}) but in Standard Korean, it is {{IPA|/pu\u02d0t\u0361\u0255\u02b0u/}} ({{lang|ko|\ubd80\ucd94}}). This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} See also the [[Japanese\u2013Koguryoic languages]] hypothesis.\n\nNonetheless, the separation of the two Korean states has resulted in increasing differences among the dialects that have emerged over time. Since the allies of the newly-founded nations split the Korean peninsula in half after 1945, the newly formed Korean nations have since borrowed vocabulary extensively from their respective allies. As the Soviet Union helped industrialize North Korea and establish it as a communist state, the North Koreans therefore borrowed a number of Russian terms. Likewise, since the United States helped South Korea extensively to develop militarily, economically, and politically, South Koreans therefore borrowed extensively from English.\n\nThe differences among northern and southern dialects have become so significant that many North Korean defectors reportedly have had great difficulty communicating with South Koreans after having initially settled into South Korea. In response to the diverging vocabularies, an app called Univoca was designed to help North Korean defectors learn South Korean terms by translating them into North Korean ones.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Korean is virtually two languages, and that's a big problem for North Korean defectors|url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-19/korean-today-virtually-two-languages-and-thats-problem-north-korean-defectors|website = Public Radio International|access-date = 2016-01-18}}</ref> More information can be found on the page [[North\u2013South differences in the Korean language|North-South differences in the Korean language]].\n\nAside from the standard language, there are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects, and they are typically partially grouped according to the [[regions of Korea]].{{citation needed|reason=This looks like something Korean popular culture tends to do for convenience, regardless of what linguists actually think.

It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}. However, the inflow of western [[Konglish|loanwords]] changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}. The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called \"initial law\" ({{lang|ko|\ub450\uc74c\ubc95\uce59}}) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.\n\nAll [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with [[no audible release]], {{IPA|[p\u031a, t\u031a, k\u031a]}}.\n\nPlosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, \u014b]}} before nasal stops.\n\n[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.\n\nOne difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}. For example,\n* \"labor\" \u2013 north: '''''r'''odong'' ({{lang|ko|\ub85c\ub3d9}}), south: '''''n'''odong'' ({{lang|ko|\ub178\ub3d9}})\n* \"history\" \u2013 north: '''''ry'''eoksa'' ({{lang|ko|\ub825\uc0ac}}), south: '''''y'''eoksa'' ({{lang|ko|\uc5ed\uc0ac}})\n* \"female\" \u2013 north: '''''ny'''eoja'' ({{lang|ko|\ub140\uc790}}), south: '''''y'''eoja'' ({{lang|ko|\uc5ec\uc790}})\n\n===Morphophonemics===\n{{Main|Morphophonology}}\nGrammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds.

The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. For details, see [[Korean parts of speech]]. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element and [[word order]] is highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''A''':||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uac8c\uc5d0}}|| &nbsp; ||{{lang|ko|\uac00\uc168\uc5b4\uc694?}}\n|-\n| || ||gage-e|| ||''ga-syeo-sseo-yo''\n|-\n| || ||store + [location marker ({{lang|ko|\uc5d0}})]|| ||[go (verb root) ({{lang|ko|\uac00}})] + [honorific ({{lang|ko|\uc2dc}})] + [conjugated (contraction rule)({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [past ({{lang|ko|\u3146}})] + [conjunctive ({{lang|ko|\uc5b4}})] + [polite marker ({{lang|ko|\uc694}})]\n|}\n:\"Did [you] go to the store?\" (\"you\" implied in conversation)\n\n{|\n|-\n|'''B''': ||&nbsp;||{{lang|ko|\uc608.}} (or {{lang|ko|\ub124.}})\n|-\n| || ||''ye'' (or ''ne'')\n|-\n| || ||yes\n|}\n:\"Yes.\"\n\n===Speech levels and honorifics===\n{{Main|Korean speech levels|Korean honorifics}}\n\nThe relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean grammar. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in ''[[honorific]]s'', whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in ''speech level''.\n\n====Honorifics====\nWhen talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee, or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences.\n\nHonorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status. For example, older people, teachers, and employers.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\">{{cite book | last = Sohn | first = Ho-Min | title = Korean Language in Culture and Society | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2694-9 |ref = harv}}</ref>\n\n====Speech levels====\nThere are seven verb [[paradigm]]s or [[Korean speech levels|''speech levels'' in Korean]], and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.<ref>{{cite book |last= Choo|first=Miho |date=2008 |title=Using Korean: A Guide to Contemporary Usage |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=3 |isbn=978-1-139-47139-8}}</ref> Unlike [[honorifics]]\u2014which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person spoken of) \u2014''speech levels'' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (the person spoken to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the verb {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\ud558\ub2e4|\ud558\ub2e4]]}} (''hada'', \"do\") in each level, plus the suffix {{lang|ko|\uccb4}} (\"che\", [[Hanja]]: {{lang|ko|\u9ad4}}), which means \"style\".\n\nThe three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as ''jondaenmal'' ({{lang|ko|\uc874\ub313\ub9d0}}), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are ''banmal'' ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}) in Korean. The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor impolite.\n\nNowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal ({{lang|ko|\ubc18\ub9d0}}). This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" />\n\n==Gender==\nIn general, Korean lacks grammatical gender.  As one of the few exceptions, the third-person singular pronoun has two different forms: \uadf8 ''geu'' (male) and \uadf8\ub140 ''geunyeo'' (female). Before \uadf8\ub140 were invented in need of translating 'she' into Korean, \uadf8 was the only one third-person singular pronoun, and had no grammatical gender.\n\nHowever, one can still find stronger contrasts between the sexes within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone's mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a ''sajang'' is a company president and ''y\u014fsajang'' is a female company president.); (4) females sometimes using more [[tag question]]s and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech from children.<ref>Cho, Young A.

University of Hawaii Press, 2006. pp. 189\u201398.</ref>\n\nBetween two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference.<ref>Kim, Minju. \"Cross Adoption of language between different genders: The case of the Korean kinship terms hyeng and enni.\" Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Women and Language Conference.

Korean social structure traditionally was a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasized the maintenance of family lines. This structure has tended to separate the roles of women from those of men.<ref>Palley, Marian Lief. \"Women\u2019s Status in South Korea: Tradition and Change.\" Asian Survey, Vol 30 No. 12. December 1990. pp. 1136\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. A significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]],<ref name=Sohn>Sohn, Ho-Min. ''The Korean Language'' (Section 1.5.3 \"Korean vocabulary\", pp. 12\u201313), Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-36943-6}}.</ref> either\n* directly borrowed from [[written Chinese]], or\n* coined in Korea or Japan using [[Chinese characters]],\n\nThe exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50\u201360%.<ref name=Sohn /> Later, the same author (2006, p.&nbsp;5) gives an even higher estimate of 65%.<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary ''Urimal Keun Sajeon'', asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=The Hankyoreh|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/religion/376204.html|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11|script-title=ko:\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0 70%\uac00 \ud55c\uc790\ub9d0? \uc77c\uc81c\uac00 \uc65c\uace1\ud55c \uac70\ub77c\ub124|trans-title=Our language is 70% hanja?

It is similar to that of English \u2014 native English words and Latinate equivalents such as ''water-aqua'', ''fire-flame'', ''sea-marine'', ''two-dual'', ''sun-solar'', ''star-stellar''. Therefore, just like other Korean words, Korean has two sets of [[Korean numerals|numeral systems]]. However, unlike English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and Chinese are [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically unrelated]] and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean [[morpheme]]s are [[Monosyllabic language|monosyllabic]] as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English. To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and other languages.<ref>A History of the Korean Language - Lee and Ramsey\n\nhttp://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/KOREAN/Lee%20Ramsey_A%20history%20of%20the%20korean%20language.pdf</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].<ref name=Sohn /> Many words have also been borrowed from [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] via [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ub974\ubc14\uc774\ud2b8}} (''[[wikt:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|areubaiteu]]'') \"part-time job\", {{lang|ko|\uc54c\ub808\ub974\uae30}} (''allereugi'') \"allergy\", {{lang|ko|\uae30\ube0c\uc2a4}} (''gibseu'' or ''gibuseu'') \"plaster cast used for broken bones\"). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example \"dozen\"&nbsp;> {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9}} ''d\u0101su''&nbsp;> {{lang|ko|\ub2e4\uc2a4}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current \"Hangulization\" rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as \"German(y)\" (see [[Names of Germany#Korean|names of Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Deutschland'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0254\u028f\u032ft\u0361\u0283.lant]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja|\u7368\u9038}} <!-- ky\u016bjitai, no \u72ec please --> ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko|[[wikt:\u7368|\u7368]]}}&nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9038|\u9038]]}}&nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:\ub3c5\uc77c|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented \"Hangeulizations\" of the countries' endonyms or English names.\n\nBecause of such a prevalence of English in modern South Korean culture and society, [[lexical borrowing]] is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or '[[Konglish]]' ({{lang|ko|\ucf69\uae00\ub9ac\uc26c}}), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary).<ref name=\"Sohn 2006\" /> However, due to North Korea's isolation, such influence is lacking in North Korean speech.\n\nKorean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange to native English speakers. For example, ''fighting'' ({{lang|ko|\ud654\uc774\ud305 / \ud30c\uc774\ud305}}) is a term of encouragement like 'come on'/'go (on)' in English. Something that is 'service' ({{lang|ko|\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4}}) is free or 'on the house'. A building referred to as an 'aparteu' ({{lang|ko|\uc544\ud30c\ud2b8}}) is an 'apartment' (but in fact refers to a residence more akin to a condominium) and a type of pencil that is called a 'sharp' ({{lang|ko|\uc0e4\ud504}}) is a mechanical pencil. Like other borrowings, many of these idiosyncrasies, including all the examples listed above, appear to be imported into Korean via Japanese, or influenced by Japanese. Many English words introduced via Japanese pronunciation have been reformed as in \uba5c\ub860 (melon) which was once called \uba54\ub860 (meron) as in Japanese.\n\nNorth Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North. In the early years, the North Korean government tried to eliminate Sino-Korean words. Consequently, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which are not in North Korean.\n\n==Writing system==\n[[File:Yeongdong Expressway Entrance Sign in Wonju Interchange.JPG|left|upright=1.36|thumb|The [[Latin alphabet]] used for foreigners in South Korea]]\n{{Korean writing}}\n{{Main|Hangul|Korean Braille|Hanja}}\n{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}\n\nBefore the creation of [[Hangul|the modern Korean alphabet]], known as Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl in North Korea and as Hangul in South Korea, people in Korea (known as [[Joseon]] at the time) primarily wrote using [[Classical Chinese]] alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including [[Idu script|idu]], [[hyangchal]], [[gugyeol]], and gakpil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hannas|first1=Wm C.|title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangping|title=Multilingual Access and Services for Digital Collections|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-3955-9|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2016|language=en|date=2016-01-18}}</ref><ref name=\"phonetic\">{{cite journal|title=Invest Korea Journal|date=1 January 2005|volume= 23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00a2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency|language=en|quote=They later devised three different systems for writing Korean with Chinese characters: Hyangchal, Gukyeol and Idu.

[[Korean punctuation]] marks are almost identical to Western ones.

The smaller ferry was cut in two and sank with the loss of 40 lives, the deadliest incident on Sydney Harbour.\n\n==The ''Greycliffe''==\n[[File:Sydney Ferry Greycliffe.jpg|thumb|''Greycliffe'' (built 1911) on Sydney Harbour]]\n\n''Greycliffe'' was a wooden double-ended screw steamship built for the Watsons Bay run. Originally owned by the Watson's Bay and South Shore Ferry Co. Pty. Ltd, she and her running mates, ''King Edward'', ''Vaucluse'' and ''Woollahra'', were taken over by [[Sydney Ferries Limited]] in 1920.  \n\nShe was of 133 gross tons, on dimensions of 125.0 [[Foot_(unit)|feet]] length between perpendiculars x 24.0 feet beam x 9.9 feet depth of hold. She was built at [[Balmain,_New_South_Wales|Balmain]], Sydney in 1911 by David Drake Ltd. The vessel was powered by a [[triple-expansion]] steam engine of 49 [[Horsepower#Nominal_(or_rated)_horsepower|nominal horse power]] made by Campbell & Calderwood that gave a maximum speed of about 12 [[Knot_(unit)|knots]]<ref>Register of British Ships, Sydney 8/1911.</ref>\n\nA double-ended screw ferry, she had a wheelhouse, rudder and propeller fitted at each end. Weathered white bulwarks ran the length of the vessel at deck level. There were segregated men\u2019s and women\u2019s saloons on the lower main deck with the mens' forward, over the boiler room, and the women\u2019s aft over the engine room. Above was an upper promenade deck which also had inside and outside seating. At each end of the upper deck were the wheelhouses.<Ref>[https://www.australianpolice.com.au/nsw-police-history-index/water-police/the-1927-tahiti-greycliffe-disaster/ australianpolice.com.au]</ref>\n\n==The collision==\n[[File:RMS TAHITI in Sydney Harbour (9511675193).jpg|thumb|left|[[RMS Tahiti|RMS ''Tahiti'']] on Sydney Harbour, circa 1920]]\n''Greycliffe'' left [[Circular Quay]], Sydney's main ferry terminus, at 4.15pm on Thursday 3 November 1927, with 120 passengers on board, including many schoolchildren returning home. The ferry stopped at [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island]] to pick up dock workers, and then resumed its journey on a course that would have taken it just north of the lighthouse near [[Shark Island (Port Jackson)|Shark Island]]. Its remaining intended stops were to be Nielsen Park, Parsley Bay, Central Wharf (near The Crescent), and Watsons Bay. On roughly the same course, however, was the [[Ocean liner|liner]] operated by the [[Union Company|Union Steamship Company of New Zealand]]'s  outward-bound transpacific [[Royal Mail Ship]], the 7,585-[[gross register ton|ton]] {{RMS|Tahiti||6}}, three times the length of ''Greycliffe''. ''Greycliffe'' was ahead and to starboard of ''Tahiti''. \n\nAt about half-way between Garden Island and [[Bradleys Head]], ''Tahiti'''s bows struck ''Greycliffe'' midships on her port side. The small ferry was pushed around perpendicular to the large steamer's bow, and momentarily was pushed along. The ferry began to overturn, and was broken in two, and the steamer sailed through the ferry, which sank immediately. Passengers who were sitting outside had an easier chance to live, while those inside the two cabins\u2014a ladies-only saloon, and a smoking room for men\u2014were trapped. A number of other boats on the harbour witnessed the collision and rescued survivors from the water.\n\nSeveral days later, smashed hull sections were towed to Whiting Beach near [[Taronga Zoo]] and divers looked for missing bodies. Seven of the forty killed were under the age of twenty, including a two-year-old boy who died along with his grandparents. Most of the victims came from the ferry's intended destination, the small Sydney suburb of [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]]. Among the other victims was [[Millicent Bryant]], who had become the first Australian woman to hold a pilot's license a few months earlier.<ref>[http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/people/aviation/display/22035-millicent-bryant Millicent Bryant plaque], Monument Australia.</ref>\n\n==Investigations and aftermath==\n[[File:Greycliffe victim.jpg|thumb|The grave of a ''Greycliffe'' disaster victim]]\nThe tragedy stunned people because of its swiftness and horror, as well as the 40 deaths and over 50<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1298214 The Disaster] ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 4 November 1927, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> injured passengers. The weather and sea were calm, with good visibility.\n\n''Greycliffe''\u2032s design was identified as flawed with the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] offering no clear view of ships coming from behind. Most witnesses, including other ferry captains, agreed that ''Tahiti'' was going too fast and that ''Greycliffe'', inexplicably, had turned sharp left into her path. ''Greycliffe''\u2032s captain, William Barnes, survived and claimed he had not consciously strayed from his course, and that he had not seen ''Tahiti'' until it was too late. He claimed that a few minutes from Garden Island, he felt the ferry pull to port, which he blamed on a problem with the steering mechanism for which he compensated.\"<ref name=Brew>Brew 2003</ref>\n\nThe pilot on board ''Tahiti'', Sydneysider Thomas Carson, said he saw the ferry swing left towards the ship, and he ordered the engines astern and a changed course. Carson and his family, who unlike Barnes, lived in Watsons Bay, along with many of the victims' families, became ''[[Persona non grata#Non-diplomatic usage|persona non-grata]]'' in the eyes of some members of the community, according to Steve Brew.<ref name=Brew/> Blaming Carson, Sydney Ferries had \"the bow theory\", which stated that when a large and a small vessel were on parallel courses in shallow water, and with the larger vessel travelling faster, its bow wave could drag the smaller vessel into the larger one.<ref name=Brew/>\n\nA Marine Court of Inquiry, formal Inquest, and Admiralty Court of Inquiry gradually shifted blame for the disaster from ''Tahiti''\u2032s pilot, Captain Thomas Carson, to the ferry master, William Barnes, and the probable failure of ''Greycliffe''\u2032s steering gear that allowed her to swing off course and into the path of the liner.<ref name=Brew/> The coronial inquest and the Admiralty Court dismissed the bow theory and accepted that, even though the Tahiti was going too fast, the collision wouldn't have occurred had not the ''Greycliffe'' turned into its path. A verdict was handed down by the final court of appeal in 1931, which concluded that while both captains were guilty of contributory negligence, the \"''Greycliffe''\u2032s navigator\" was twice as culpable as Carson. The various inquiries had difficulty obtaining evidence between voyages of the ''Tahiti'' and, on one occasion, an embarrassing clash of the courts took place.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32080336/2811422 Coroner's Inquest: Clash of Interests] ''[[The West Australian]]'', 29 November 1927, p 7 at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref>\n\nUsing the transcripts of the inquiries, Brew believes Carson's reputation was unfairly tainted, in particular by Justice James Lang Campbell, the Supreme Court judge appointed to preside over the initial marine inquiry.<ref name=Brew/> Campbell accepted evidence from witnesses that ''Tahiti'' was probably travelling at {{convert|12|kn|km/h}} instead of the permitted eight knots. However, he refuted evidence from the same witnesses that the ''Greycliffe'' had turned directly into the path of ''Tahiti''.<ref name=Brew/>\n\n==Sinking of ''Tahiti''==\nOn 15 August 1930, ''Tahiti''\u2032s hull was punctured by a broken propeller shaft while she was at sea between [[Wellington]] and [[Rarotonga]].

In 1928, it was shipped to New Zealand. Where the engine was stored is not known but in 1938 the engine was installed into the [[Tirau]] dairy factory in the [[Waikato]] region. A large, grooved 2-metre (6.5-foot) [[flywheel]] was fitted to the [[crankshaft]]. By using continuous rope belts, the engine drove [[ammonia]] compressors and butter churns. After 30 years service, it was donated to the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]] in [[Auckland]] and was installed as a working exhibit over the next four years.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Brew, Steve.
