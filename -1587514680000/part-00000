According to the people of Almeirim, a poor friar who was on a pilgrimage stopped in the village of Almeirim and knocked on the door of a house. He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make \u201ca delicious and filling\u2026\u2026.stone soup\u201d. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the iron clad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri\u00e7o (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time.\n\nNowadays Almeirim is a gastronomical destiny for Portuguese people, as well as for foreign people, willing to taste this soup. Restaurants like \"O Pinheiro\", \"o Toucinho\" and \"O Minhoto\" are restaurants that serve this dish.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Cristina Branco]] (born 28 December 1972), is a musician and [[Fado|fadista]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Almeirim IPR]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links==\n{{Commons category|Almeirim}}\n* [http://www.almeirinense.com/almeirinense/ \"O Almeirinense\" Regional Newspaper]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/vitor107/sets/72057594068043827/ Photos from Almeirim]\n\n{{Municipalities of Santar\u00e9m}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Santar\u00e9m District]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Santar\u00e9m District]]\n[[Category:Almeirim| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the municipality in Portugal|the municipality in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|Almeirim, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe|the municipality in Brazil|Almeirim, Par\u00e1|the wine|Almeirim wine}}\n{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type            = municipality\n| official_name   = Almeirim\n| image_flag      = Pt-alr3.png\n| image_shield    = ALR1.png\n| image_skyline   = Restaurantes em Almeirim.JPG\n| image_caption   = \n|coordinates             = {{coord|39|12|N|8|37|W|type:adm1st_region:PT_dim:100000|display=inline,title}}\n| image_map       = LocalAlmeirim.svg\n|region             = Alentejo\n|CIM                = [[Lez\u00edria do Tejo]]\n|district           = [[Santar\u00e9m District|Santar\u00e9m]]\n|parishes           = [[#Parishes|4]]\n| leader_party            = [[Portuguese Socialist Party|PS]]\n| leader_name             = Pedro Ribeiro\n| area_total_km2          = 222.12\n| population_total        = 23376\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| holiday         = [[Ascension Day]]\n| website                 = {{url|www.cm-almeirim.pt}}\n}}\n'''Almeirim''' ({{IPA-pt|\u0250lm\u0250j\u02c8\u027e\u0129|-|Pt-pt Almeirim FF.ogg}}) is a city and a municipality in [[Santar\u00e9m District]], Portugal.

According to the people of Almeirim, a poor friar who was on a pilgrimage stopped in the village of Almeirim and knocked on the door of a house. He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make \u201ca delicious and filling\u2026\u2026.stone soup\u201d. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the iron clad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri\u00e7o (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time.\n\nNowadays Almeirim is a gastronomical destiny for Portuguese people, as well as for foreign people, willing to taste this soup. Restaurants like \"O Pinheiro\", \"o Toucinho\" and \"O Minhoto\" are restaurants that serve this dish.\n\n==Notable citizens==\n* [[Cristina Branco]] (born 28 December 1972), is a musician and [[Fado|fadista]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Almeirim IPR]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links==\n{{Commons category|Almeirim}}\n* [http://www.almeirinense.com/almeirinense/ \"O Almeirinense\" Regional Newspaper]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/vitor107/sets/72057594068043827/ Photos from Almeirim]\n\n{{Municipalities of Santar\u00e9m}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Portugal]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Santar\u00e9m District]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Santar\u00e9m District]]\n[[Category:Almeirim| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almeirim"}
