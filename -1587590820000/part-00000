The character was not originally in the [[The Walking Dead (comics)|comic book series of the same name]], but was created specifically for Reedus after his audition for the character of [[Merle Dixon]]. ''The Walking Dead'' comic creator [[Robert Kirkman]] feels \"absolutely blessed Reedus has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Reedus's portrayal of the character in the [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|first season]] inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the [[The Walking Dead (season 2)|second season]].
