He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident [[George W. Bush]] picked Paul O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be seen as a figure to respect by those on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hoped he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |editor1-last=Desmond |editor1-first=Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-59061-9 |pages=85-86 |url= |chapter=3. Personnel}}</ref>\n\n[[Ron Suskind]] interviewed O'Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush Administration. He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-5545-3}}) 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.

He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident [[George W. Bush]] picked Paul O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be seen as a figure to respect by those on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hoped he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |editor1-last=Desmond |editor1-first=Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-59061-9. |pages=85-86 |url= |chapter=3. Personnel}}</ref>\n\n[[Ron Suskind]] interviewed O'Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush Administration. He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-5545-3}}) 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.

In the opinion, he suggested that doctors and hospitals should be required to report medical errors within 24 hours, as well as moving malpractice suits out of the civil courts and into a new, independent body.

Yorktown is one of the three points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]]. It is the site of the last battle and surrender of British forces in 1781 at the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the patriots gained independence from [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn modern times, several important U.S. military installations have been developed in the county. It also has miles of waterfront residential and recreational areas. York County adjoins the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[theme park]] and includes within its borders the affiliated [[Water Country USA]] [[water park]], the [[Yorktown Riverfront]] area, [[Yorktown Battlefield and Visitor Center]] and [[American Revolution Museum at Yorktown]]. Yorktown is linked by the [[National Park Service|National Park Service's]] bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and historic attractions at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Heritage tourism to the Historic Triangle draws international visitors and is a major economic activity for the county.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American Indians===\nThe area which is now York County was long inhabited by succeeding cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. These were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups during the late [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BC to AD 1000) and earlier.\n\nBy the late 16th century, much of the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal plain]] draining to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of the current Commonwealth of Virginia was called ''[[Tenakomakah]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], meaning \"densely inhabited land\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capossela|first1=Julie Ann|title=Jamestown from a Non-Western Perspective|url=http://www.wm.edu/niahd/journals/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965 |website=wm.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022073344/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965&svr=www|archivedate=22 October 2008|date=2 February 2006}} ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language]]: ''danakamigaa'': \"activity-grounds\", ''i.e.'' \"land of much events [for the People]\"</ref> The historic tribes of the Tidewater area spoke related Algonquian languages. Other Algonquian-speaking peoples occupied coastal areas north and into present-day Canada, as well as to the South.\n\nIn the Virginia region, a [[weroance]] (or chief) named [[Wahunsunacock]] (1547\u20131618) of the [[Powhatan people]] created a powerful empire of eastern-Algonquian language-speaking peoples known as the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]; he conquered or allied by agreement with approximately 30 tribes. Known as the Powhatan, meaning the paramount chief, he was from a village also known as \"Powhatan\", near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[James River]]. (The Powhatan Hill neighborhood of the current city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was developed near this former site.) Chief Powhatan later established a second capital village, known as [[Werowocomoco]], in a centrally located position in Tenakomakah. Rediscovered in the early 21st century by archeological work, it was located along the north bank of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in present-day [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]].<ref>[http://powhatan.wm.edu/history/index.htm Powhatan: \"Powhatan: Werowocomoco\"], College of William and Mary</ref>\n\nThe [[Chiskiack]] tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy lived in York County along the York River until the 1630s. Escalating conflicts with the expanding English colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] caused them to move to the west. The English developed a village settlement near the village of Chiskiack and adopted its name. (It is sometimes spelled \"Kiskiack\"). This became part of the developments included within the present-day [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] near Yorktown and are included in the military base. Cheesecake Road and Cheesecake Cemetery are also within the base; their names are thought to derive from the early Chiskiack people.\n\nAfter the Powhatan moved his capital from this area in 1609, the site believed to have been Werowocomoco near [[Purtan Bay]] was lost to history. It was rediscovered in the early 21st century, and has been under continuing [[archaeological]] study projects. The discoveries and ongoing research led by the [[College of William and Mary]] hold great promise in expanding understanding of the lives of the Native Americans in the area during that era of York County's history.\n\n{{details|Powhatan Confederacy}}\n\n===Ajac\u00e1n Mission===\nIn 1570, Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests founded the [[Ajac\u00e1n Mission]] in this area. They were guided by interpreter [[Don Luis]], a Native American from this area who had been taken captive by an earlier expedition. He was taken to Spain and later to Mexico, where he was baptized as Don Luis and educated in the Jesuit system. Ten years later after returning to Virginia, he soon abandoned the Spanish group. In February 1571 he led an attack on the Jesuits; all of the party except a young boy were killed. The following year, a Spanish force returned to the region for punishment and reclaimed the youth Alonso. The Spanish did not attempt another mission in this part of North America.\n\n===Virginia Colony===\nAbout 30 years later, English colonists arrived and established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 on the southern shore of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]. In 1619, the area which is now York County was included in two of the four incorporations (or \"citties\") of the proprietary [[Virginia Company of London]] which were known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].\n\nIn 1634, what is now York County was formed as [[Charles River Shire]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]]<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> and named for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Charles River Shire took its name from the younger son of King [[James I of England|James I]]. In the 21st century, it was one of the five original shires considered extant in essentially its same political form, making it one of the oldest counties in the United States.\n\nIn 1643 Charles River County and the Charles River (also named for the king) were changed to York County<ref name=\"William Waller Hening 1809 page 249\"/> and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], respectively. The river, county, and town of [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] are believed to have been named for [[York]], a city in [[Northern England]].\n\n===Yorktown===\n[[File:YorkHallYorktown.jpg|thumb|175px|York Hall]]\n\nThe first courthouse and jail were located near what is now [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] although the community, founded as a port for shipping [[tobacco]] to Europe, as variously called Port of York, Borough of York, York, Town of York, until Yorktown was established in 1691, when the [[House of Burgesses]] required each county to designate a port of entry and build warehousing. Although never formally incorporated as a town, Yorktown is the [[county seat]] of York County. The only town ever incorporated within the county's boundaries was [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which was incorporated in 1952 and became an [[independent city]] in 1975.\n\n[[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], the hunting lodge of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], last royal governor of Virginia, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIt is most famous as the site of the surrender of General [[Cornwallis]] to General [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Yorktown also figured prominently in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in 1862.\n\n===Other communities, boundary changes===\nThe small unincorporated town of [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] and a nearby area known as \"the Reservation\" were taken over by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War I]]. This is now part of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]]. Many of the displaced [[African American]] landowners were eventually relocated to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], along the border between York and James counties.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the sites of three other small York County towns were absorbed into U.S. government reservations. [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]] was the site of a [[World War I]] munitions facility operated by the [[DuPont]] company, and was made a part of [[Cheatham Annex]]) in 1943. To the west of Penniman, which is reported to have had a peak population of 15,000, on land which is now part of [[Camp Peary]], the smaller towns of [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] and [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]] were located. Much of Magruder's population and at least one church were relocated to Grove, increasing its population.\n\nIn 1949, the county grew by {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|0}}, as land in that amount was ceded to York County by neighboring [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]]. At the time, the move was part of a successful attempt by Warwick County to block an annexation suit brought by the [[Newport News, Virginia|City of Newport News]]. Warwick eventually consolidated with the city in 1958 by mutual agreement. (The reduction in size allowed Warwick County to claim an exemption from the proposed annexation at the time).\n\nIn 1975, the county lost {{convert|15.5|sqmi|km2|1}} of land as the [[incorporated town]] of [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which had been within York County, became an [[independent city]], although ties between the county and the new city remained close. Over 40 years later, they continue to share courts, sheriff's office, a jail, and some constitutional services.\n\nYork County also adjoins another small independent city, Williamsburg, which was long located within James City County. In the 20th century, some areas of York County adjacent to Williamsburg were lost to the growing small city through annexation.\n\n===York County in the late 20th and early 21st centuries===\nFrom the 1980s to modern times, York County experienced a rapid transition from a rural county to a bedroom community for the neighboring core cities of [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].\n\nIn modern times, York County and Yorktown in particular are part of an important historical area of attractions known as the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]], which includes Yorktown, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Yorktown is the northern terminus of the scenic [[Colonial Parkway]] operated by the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which links the three. In 2005, the county completed Riverwalk Landing, a successful pseudo-colonial waterfront development at Yorktown to revitalize the previously deteriorating beach and town district and complement the 2007 celebration of Jamestown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Entering Coleman Bridge from Yorktown Side.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Coleman Bridge connects York County and neighboring Gloucester County]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|215|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|105|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} (51.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Virginia by land area. It is near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAlso, in terms of population clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains the majority of the county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.\n\nThe northern portion is more connected with the Williamsburg community than Yorktown and, although less populous than the south, is also fairly dense. Having not seen a significant amount of growth until recently, the northern portion is now seeing the development of new residential communities and shopping areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties and cities===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] (north)\n* [[Mathews County, Virginia]] (northeast)\n* [[Northampton County, Virginia]] (east)\n* [[Poquoson, Virginia]] (southeast)\n|\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]] (south)\n* [[Newport News, Virginia]] (southwest)\n* [[James City County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] (west)\n|}\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Colonial National Historical Park]] (part)\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Yorktown, VA <ref>http://www.usa.com/yorktown-va-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature</ref>\n|28.3|48.1|3.6\n|30.5|51.6|3.2\n|36.6|59.9|4.3\n|45.4|70.1|3.3\n|54.6|77.4|3.9\n|63.6|85.1|3.5\n|68|88.8|4.6\n|66.3|86.6|4.7\n|59.7|80.8|4.2\n|48.4|71.2|3.4\n|39.7|61.6|3.3\n|31.5|51.6|3.4\n|units = imperial\n|clear = both }}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 5233\n|1800= 3231\n|1810= 5187\n|1820= 4384\n|1830= 5354\n|1840= 4720\n|1850= 4460\n|1860= 4949\n|1870= 7198\n|1880= 7349\n|1890= 7596\n|1900= 7482\n|1910= 7757\n|1920= 8046\n|1930= 7615\n|1940= 8857\n|1950= 11750\n|1960= 21583\n|1970= 33203\n|1980= 35463\n|1990= 42422\n|2000= 56297\n|2010= 65464\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=67846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Located along the York River, small portions of each base extend into adjacent James City County as well.\n\nThe [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] was originally established during [[World War I]] by order of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and now includes the formerly separate Cheatham Annex Supply Complex. [[Camp Peary]] was established during [[World War II]] as a [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Training Base. As the war progressed, it became valuable to the Allied Forces to house sensitive prisoners-of-war from captured German naval vessels; it was important for Nazi authorities to be unaware of their capture, since that also meant secret code books thought lost-at sea may also have been compromised. Many of these POWs made Virginia and the United States their new homeland after the War. Separating these two large military reservations is [[Queen's Creek]], which originates in the western reaches of the county and drains to the York River.\n\nYork County contains some [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|former towns]] including Yorke, and a large number when the military reservations were created in the first half of the 20th century.

Yorktown is one of the three points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]]. It is the site of the last battle and surrender of British forces in 1781 at the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the patriots gained independence from [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn modern times, several important U.S. military installations have been developed in the county. It also has miles of waterfront residential and recreational areas. York County adjoins the [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] [[theme park]] and includes within its borders the affiliated [[Water Country USA]] [[water park]], the [[Yorktown Riverfront]] area, [[Yorktown Battlefield and Visitor Center]] and [[American Revolution Museum at Yorktown]]. Yorktown is linked by the [[National Park Service|National Park Service's]] bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] with [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and historic attractions at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Heritage tourism to the Historic Triangle draws international visitors and is a major economic activity for the county.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American Indians===\nThe area which is now York County was long inhabited by succeeding cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. These were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups during the late [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BC to AD 1000) and earlier.\n\nBy the late 16th century, much of the [[Atlantic coastal plain|coastal plain]] draining to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] of the current Commonwealth of Virginia was called ''[[Tenakomakah]]'' in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], meaning \"densely inhabited land\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Capossela|first1=Julie Ann|title=Jamestown from a Non-Western Perspective|url=http://www.wm.edu/niahd/journals/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965 |website=wm.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022073344/http://niahd.wm.edu/index.php?browse=entry&id=4965&svr=www|archivedate=22 October 2008|date=2 February 2006}} ''c.f.'' [[Anishinaabe language]]: ''danakamigaa'': \"activity-grounds\", ''i.e.'' \"land of much events [for the People]\"</ref> The historic tribes of the Tidewater area spoke related Algonquian languages. Other Algonquian-speaking peoples occupied coastal areas north and into present-day Canada, as well as to the South.\n\nIn the Virginia region, a [[weroance]] (or chief) named [[Wahunsunacock]] (1547\u20131618) of the [[Powhatan people]] created a powerful empire of eastern-Algonquian language-speaking peoples known as the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]; he conquered or allied by agreement with approximately 30 tribes. Known as the Powhatan, meaning the paramount chief, he was from a village also known as \"Powhatan\", near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[James River]]. (The Powhatan Hill neighborhood of the current city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was developed near this former site.) Chief Powhatan later established a second capital village, known as [[Werowocomoco]], in a centrally located position in Tenakomakah. Rediscovered in the early 21st century by archeological work, it was located along the north bank of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in present-day [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]].<ref>[http://powhatan.wm.edu/history/index.htm Powhatan: \"Powhatan: Werowocomoco\"], College of William and Mary</ref>\n\nThe [[Chiskiack]] tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy lived in York County along the York River until the 1630s. Escalating conflicts with the expanding English colony based at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] caused them to move to the west. The English developed a village settlement near the village of Chiskiack and adopted its name. (It is sometimes spelled \"Kiskiack\"). This became part of the developments included within the present-day [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] near Yorktown and are included in the military base. Cheesecake Road and Cheesecake Cemetery are also within the base; their names are thought to derive from the early Chiskiack people.\n\nAfter the Powhatan moved his capital from this area in 1609, the site believed to have been Werowocomoco near [[Purtan Bay]] was lost to history. It was rediscovered in the early 21st century, and has been under continuing [[archaeological]] study projects. The discoveries and ongoing research led by the [[College of William and Mary]] hold great promise in expanding understanding of the lives of the Native Americans in the area during that era of York County's history.\n\n{{details|Powhatan Confederacy}}\n\n===Ajac\u00e1n Mission===\nIn 1570, Spanish [[Jesuit]] priests founded the [[Ajac\u00e1n Mission]] in this area. They were guided by interpreter [[Don Luis]], a Native American from this area who had been taken captive by an earlier expedition. He was taken to Spain and later to Mexico, where he was baptized as Don Luis and educated in the Jesuit system. Ten years later after returning to Virginia, he soon abandoned the Spanish group. In February 1571 he led an attack on the Jesuits; all of the party except a young boy were killed. The following year, a Spanish force returned to the region for punishment and reclaimed the youth Alonso. The Spanish did not attempt another mission in this part of North America.\n\n===Virginia Colony===\nAbout 30 years later, English colonists arrived and established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607 on the southern shore of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]. In 1619, the area which is now York County was included in two of the four incorporations (or \"citties\") of the proprietary [[Virginia Company of London]] which were known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].\n\nIn 1634, what is now York County was formed as [[Charles River Shire]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]]<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> and named for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Charles River Shire took its name from the younger son of King [[James I of England|James I]]. In the 21st century, it was one of the five original shires considered extant in essentially its same political form, making it one of the oldest counties in the United States.\n\nIn 1643 Charles River County and the Charles River (also named for the king) were changed to York County<ref name=\"William Waller Hening 1809 page 249\"/> and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], respectively. The river, county, and town of [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] are believed to have been named for [[York]], a city in [[Northern England]].\n\n===Yorktown===\n[[File:YorkHallYorktown.jpg|thumb|175px|York Hall]]\n\nThe first courthouse and jail were located near what is now [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] although the community, founded as a port for shipping [[tobacco]] to Europe, as variously called Port of York, Borough of York, York, Town of York, until Yorktown was established in 1691, when the [[House of Burgesses]] required each county to designate a port of entry and build warehousing. Although never formally incorporated as a town, Yorktown is the [[county seat]] of York County. The only town ever incorporated within the county's boundaries was [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which was incorporated in 1952 and became an [[independent city]] in 1975.\n\n[[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], the hunting lodge of [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], last royal governor of Virginia, still stands on the grounds of Camp Peary. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIt is most famous as the site of the surrender of General [[Cornwallis]] to General [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Yorktown also figured prominently in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in 1862.\n\n===Other communities, boundary changes===\nThe small unincorporated town of [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] and a nearby area known as \"the Reservation\" were taken over by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War I]]. This is now part of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]]. Many of the displaced [[African American]] landowners were eventually relocated to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], along the border between York and James counties.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the sites of three other small York County towns were absorbed into U.S. government reservations. [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]] was the site of a [[World War I]] munitions facility operated by the [[DuPont]] company, and was made a part of [[Cheatham Annex]]) in 1943. To the west of Penniman, which is reported to have had a peak population of 15,000, on land which is now part of [[Camp Peary]], the smaller towns of [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] and [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]] were located. Much of Magruder's population and at least one church were relocated to Grove, increasing its population.\n\nIn 1949, the county grew by {{convert|4|sqmi|km2|0}}, as land in that amount was ceded to York County by neighboring [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]]. At the time, the move was part of a successful attempt by Warwick County to block an annexation suit brought by the [[Newport News, Virginia|City of Newport News]]. Warwick eventually consolidated with the city in 1958 by mutual agreement. (The reduction in size allowed Warwick County to claim an exemption from the proposed annexation at the time).\n\nIn 1975, the county lost {{convert|15.5|sqmi|km2|1}} of land as the [[incorporated town]] of [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], which had been within York County, became an [[independent city]], although ties between the county and the new city remained close. Over 40 years later, they continue to share courts, sheriff's office, a jail, and some constitutional services.\n\nYork County also adjoins another small independent city, Williamsburg, which was long located within James City County. In the 20th century, some areas of York County adjacent to Williamsburg were lost to the growing small city through annexation.\n\n===York County in the late 20th and early 21st centuries===\nFrom the 1980s to modern times, York County experienced a rapid transition from a rural county to a bedroom community for the neighboring core cities of [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].\n\nIn modern times, York County and Yorktown in particular are part of an important historical area of attractions known as the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]], which includes Yorktown, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. Yorktown is the northern terminus of the scenic [[Colonial Parkway]] operated by the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which links the three. In 2005, the county completed Riverwalk Landing, a successful pseudo-colonial waterfront development at Yorktown to revitalize the previously deteriorating beach and town district and complement the 2007 celebration of Jamestown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Entering Coleman Bridge from Yorktown Side.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Coleman Bridge connects York County and neighboring Gloucester County]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|215|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|105|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} (51.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is the third-smallest county in Virginia by land area. It is near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAlso, in terms of population clusters, the County is divided by a vast expanse of federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains the majority of the county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.\n\nThe northern portion is more connected with the Williamsburg community than Yorktown and, although less populous than the south, is also fairly dense. Having not seen a significant amount of growth until recently, the northern portion is now seeing the development of new residential communities and shopping areas.\n\n===Adjacent counties and cities===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] (north)\n* [[Mathews County, Virginia]] (northeast)\n* [[Northampton County, Virginia]] (east)\n* [[Poquoson, Virginia]] (southeast)\n|\n* [[Hampton, Virginia]] (south)\n* [[Newport News, Virginia]] (southwest)\n* [[James City County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] (west)\n|}\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Colonial National Historical Park]] (part)\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{climate chart\n| Yorktown, VA <ref>http://www.usa.com/yorktown-va-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature</ref>\n|28.3|48.1|3.6\n|30.5|51.6|3.2\n|36.6|59.9|4.3\n|45.4|70.1|3.3\n|54.6|77.4|3.9\n|63.6|85.1|3.5\n|68|88.8|4.6\n|66.3|86.6|4.7\n|59.7|80.8|4.2\n|48.4|71.2|3.4\n|39.7|61.6|3.3\n|31.5|51.6|3.4\n|units = imperial\n|clear = both }}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 5233\n|1800= 3231\n|1810= 5187\n|1820= 4384\n|1830= 5354\n|1840= 4720\n|1850= 4460\n|1860= 4949\n|1870= 7198\n|1880= 7349\n|1890= 7596\n|1900= 7482\n|1910= 7757\n|1920= 8046\n|1930= 7615\n|1940= 8857\n|1950= 11750\n|1960= 21583\n|1970= 33203\n|1980= 35463\n|1990= 42422\n|2000= 56297\n|2010= 65464\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=67846\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Located along the York River, small portions of each base extend into adjacent James City County as well.\n\nThe [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]] was originally established during [[World War I]] by order of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and now includes the formerly separate Cheatham Annex Supply Complex. [[Camp Peary]] was established during [[World War II]] as a [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] Training Base. As the war progressed, it became valuable to the Allied Forces to house sensitive prisoners-of-war from captured German naval vessels; it was important for Nazi authorities to be unaware of their capture, since that also meant secret code books thought lost-at sea may also have been compromised. Many of these POWs made Virginia and the United States their new homeland after the War. Separating these two large military reservations is [[Queen's Creek]], which originates in the western reaches of the county and drains to the York River.\n\nYork County contains some [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|former towns]] including Yorke, and a large number when the military reservations were created in the first half of the 20th century. These include the original [[Lackey, Virginia|Lackey]] (known locally as \"the Reservation\"), [[Halstead's Point, Virginia|Halstead's Point]], [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]], [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]], and [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]]. Many relocated residents and their descendants, many of whom were farmers and watermen, now live in such places as Yorktown, Gloucester, [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]], [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], and [[Lightfoot, Virginia|Lightfoot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Publications===\n* McCartney, Martha W.
