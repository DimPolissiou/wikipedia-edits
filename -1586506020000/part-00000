The [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] are divided into three groups: The befal (company officers, ranks [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] to [[Captain (land)|Captain]] inclusive), the staff officers (stabsoffiser, ranks Major to brigadier inclusive), and the generals (Major General to General inclusive).\n\n''Fenrik'' ([[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]) used to be referred to as [[Second Lieutenant]] (Norwegian:''' Fenrik'''), while the rank of lieutenant went by First Lieutenant. The rank of Brigadier is not an old tradition in the Norwegian armed forces and was instated as a replacement for ''Oberst I'' (First Colonel); what is now ''Oberst'' used to be ''Oberst II'' (Second Colonel). As shown, the [[Cavalry]] have two ranks which differ from the [[regular Army]]: Dragon ([[Dragoon]]) instead of Menig ([[Private (rank)|Private]]), and Rittmester ([[Rittmeister]]) instead of Kaptein ([[Captain (land)|Captain]]).\n\n\nThe ranks of ''Grenader'' and ''Matros'' were bestowed upon soldiers who have finished the 12 months compulsory service and had signed one or more three-year contracts to continue serving. The ranks of ''Visekorporal/Visekonstabel/Vingsoldat'' ([[Corporal]]/Leading Rate) were usually ascribed to soldiers with long and/or outstanding service, though may be bestowed on soldiers with extra responsibilities (e.g. the shift-commander among a group of soldiers on guard-duty). A ''UB-Korporal/Kvartermesteraspirant'' (Rate Corporal/Petty Officer-in-training) was a soldier who has finished the UB course ''(Utskrevet Befalskurs)'', a course intended to prepare conscripted soldiers for non-commissioned officer duties, but still under training in \"the field\".

The [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] are divided into three groups: The befal (company officers, ranks [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] to [[Captain (land)|Captain]] inclusive), the staff officers (stabsoffiser, ranks Major to brigadier inclusive), and the generals (Major General to General inclusive).\n\n''Fenrik'' ([[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]) used to be referred to as [[Second Lieutenant]] (Norwegian:''' Fenrik'''), while the rank of lieutenant went by First Lieutenant. The rank of Brigadier is not an old tradition in the Norwegian armed forces and was instated as a replacement for ''Oberst I'' (First Colonel); what is now ''Oberst'' used to be ''Oberst II'' (Second Colonel). As shown, the [[Cavalry]] have two ranks which differ from the [[regular Army]]: Dragon ([[Dragoon]]) instead of Menig ([[Private (rank)|Private]]), and Rittmester ([[Rittmeister]]) instead of Kaptein ([[Captain (land)|Captain]]).\n\n\nThe ranks of ''Grenader'' and ''Matros'' were bestowed upon soldiers who have finished the 12 months compulsory service and had signed one or more three-year contracts to continue serving. The ranks of ''Visekorporal/Visekonstabel/Vingsoldat'' ([[Corporal]]/Leading Rate) were usually ascribed to soldiers with long and/or outstanding service, though may be bestowed on soldiers with extra responsibilities (e.g. the shift-commander among a group of soldiers on guard-duty). A ''UB-Korporal/Kvartermesteraspirant'' (Rate Corporal/Petty Officer-in-training) was a soldier who has finished the UB course ''(Utskrevet Befalskurs)'', a course intended to prepare conscripted soldiers for non-commissioned officer duties, but still under training in \"the field\". After one-year course and service these soldiers were qualified for the rank of ''Sersjant'' or ''Kvartermester''.\n\n====Officers====\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n!

{"title_page": "Turkic mythology", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Irk bitig 07.jpg|thumb|right|The 10th-century ''[[Irk Bitig]]'' or \"Book of Divination\" of [[Dunhuang]] is an important source for early Turkic mythology]]\n{{Culture of Turkey}}\n'''Turkic mythology''' features [[Tengrism|Tengri]]ist and [[Shamanism in Central Asia|Shamanist]] strata of belief along with many other social and cultural constructs related to the nomadic existence of the Turkic peoples in early times. Later, especially after the [[Turkic migration]], some of the myths were embellished to some degree with [[Islam]]ic symbolism. Turkic mythology shares numerous points in common with Mongol mythology and both of these probably took shape in a milieu in which an essentially nationalist mythology was early syncretised with elements deriving from [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Turkic mythology has also been influenced by other local mythologies. For example, in [[Tatar]] mythology elements of Finnic and Indo-European mythologies co-exist. Beings from Tatar mythology include [[\u00c4b\u00e4d\u00e4]], [[Alara (fairy)|Alara]], [[\u015e\u00fcr\u00e4le]], [[\u015eek\u00e4]], [[Pitsen]], [[Tulpar]], and [[Zilant]]. The early Turks apparently practised all the then-current major religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorianism|Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Manichaeism]], before the majority converted to Islam; often syncretising these other religions into their prevailing mythological understanding.<ref>JENS PETER LAUT ''Vielfalt t\u00fcrkischer Religionen'' p. 25 (German) </ref>\n\n''[[Irk Bitig]]'', a 10th-century manuscript found in [[Dunhuang]] is one of the most important sources for Turkic mythology and religion. The book is written in [[Old Turkic alphabet]] like the [[Orkhon inscriptions]].\n\n==Gods in Turkic mythology==\n{{Main|List of Turkic mythological figures}}\nDeities are impersonated creative and ruling powers. Even if they are [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]], the qualities of the deities are always in the foreground. In the Turkic belief system, there was no [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of deities as in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[polytheism]]. Many deities could be thought of as [[angel]]s in the modern [[Western culture|Western]] usage, or spirits, who travel between humans or their settlement among higher deities such as [[Kayra]].<ref>[[:tr:Dosya:TurkSoylenceSozlugu.pdf|Turkish Myths Glossary (T\u00fcrk S\u00f6ylence S\u00f6zl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc), Deniz Karakurt]]{{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n\n[[\u0130ye]] are guardian spirits responsible for specific natural elements.

He was known as y\u00fcce or yarat\u0131c\u0131 tengri (Creator God). After the Turks started to migrate and leave middle Asia and see monotheistic religions, Tengrism was changed from its pagan/polytheistic origins. The religion was more like Zoroastrianism after its change, with only two of the original gods remaining, Tengri, representing the good god and [[U\u00e7mag]] (a place like heaven or valhalla), while Erlik took the position of the bad god and hell. The words [[Tengri]] and [[Sky]] were synonyms. It is unknown how Tengri looks. He rules the fates of the entire people and acts freely. But he is fair as he awards and punishes. The well-being of the people depends on his will. Tengri worship is first attested in the [[Old Turkic]] [[Orkhon inscriptions]] of the early 8th century.\n\n===Other deities===\n[[Umay]] (The Turkic root um\u0101y originally meant 'placenta, afterbirth') is the goddess of fertility and virginity. [[Umay]] resembles earth-mother goddesses found in various other world religions and is the daughter of Tengri.\n\n[[\u00d6d Tengri]] is the god of time being not well-known, as it states in the Orkhon stones, \"\u00d6d tengri is the ruler of time\" and a son of K\u00f6k Tengri.\n\n[[Boz Tengri]], like \u00d6d Tengri, is not known much. He is seen as the god of the grounds and steppes and is a son of K\u00f6k Tengri.\n\n[[Kayra]] is the Spirit of God. Primordial god of highest sky, upper air, space, atmosphere, light, life and son of K\u00f6k Tengri.\n\n[[\u00dclgen]] is the son of Kayra and Umay and is the god of goodness. The Aru\u011f (Ar\u0131) denotes \"good spirits\" in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] mythology.

This might have led to or sourced from the term \"at-[[bey]]i\" (horse-lord).\n\nThe [[dragon]] (Evren, also Ebren), also expressed as a [[snake]] or [[lizard]], is the symbol of might and power.  It is believed, especially in mountainous [[Central Asia]], that dragons still live in the mountains of [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan/Tengri Tagh]] and [[Altay Mountains|Altay]]. Dragons also symbolize the god [[Tengri]] (Tanr\u0131) in ancient Turkic tradition, although dragons themselves were not worshiped as gods.\n\nThe World Tree or [[Tree of Life]] is a central symbol in Turkic mythology. According to the Altai Turks, human beings are actually descended from trees. According to the [[Yakuts]], White Mother sits at the base of the Tree of Life, whose branches reach to the heavens, where they are occupied by various supernatural creatures which have come to life there. The blue sky around the tree reflects the peaceful nature of the country and the red ring that surrounds all of the elements symbolizes the ancient faith of rebirth, growth and development of the Turkic peoples.\n\nAmong the animals the [[deer]] was considered to be the [[mediation|mediator]] ''par excellence'' between the worlds of gods and men; thus at the [[Funeral|funeral ceremony]] the [[Soul|deceased]] was accompanied in his/her journey to the [[Tamag|underworld]] or [[U\u00e7mag|abode of the ancestors]] by the spirit of a deer offered as a funerary [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] (or present symbolically in [[funerary art|funerary iconography]] accompanying the [[Cadaver|physical body]]) acting as [[psychopomp]].<ref>[http://tengrifund.ru/totem-of-deer-in-turkic-peoples.html]</ref> A late appearance of this deer motif of Turkic mythology and folklore in Islamic times features in the celebrated tale of 13th century Sufi mystic [[Geyikl\u00fc Baba]] (meaning \"father deer\"), of [[Khoy]], who in his later years lived the life of an ascetic in the mountain forests of [[Bursa]] - variously riding a deer, wandering with the herds of wild deer or simply clad in their skins -  according to different sources. (In this instance the ancient funerary associations of the deer (literal or physical death) may be seen here to have been given a new (Islamic) slant by their equation with the metaphorical death of ''[[Fana (Sufism)|fanaa]]'' (the Sufi practice of dying-to-self) which leads to spiritual rebirth in the mystic rapture of ''[[baqaa]]'').<ref>[https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/geyikli-baba]</ref> A curious parallel to this Turkic story of a mystical forest hermit mounted on a deer exists in the ''[[Vita Merlini]]'' of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in which the [[Celts|Celtic]] prophet [[Merlin]] is depicted on such an unusual steed.

Later, especially after the [[Turkic migration]], some of the myths were embellished to some degree with [[Islam]]ic symbolism. Turkic mythology shares numerous points in common with Mongol mythology and both of these probably took shape in a milieu in which an essentially nationalist mythology was early syncretised with elements deriving from [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Turkic mythology has also been influenced by other local mythologies. For example, in [[Tatar]] mythology elements of Finnic and Indo-European mythologies co-exist. Beings from Tatar mythology include [[\u00c4b\u00e4d\u00e4]], [[Alara (fairy)|Alara]], [[\u015e\u00fcr\u00e4le]], [[\u015eek\u00e4]], [[Pitsen]], [[Tulpar]], and [[Zilant]]. The early Turks apparently practised all the then-current major religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorianism|Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Manichaeism]], before the majority converted to Islam; often syncretising these other religions into their prevailing mythological understanding.<ref>JENS PETER LAUT ''Vielfalt t\u00fcrkischer Religionen'' p. 25 (German) </ref>\n\n''[[Irk Bitig]]'', a 10th-century manuscript found in [[Dunhuang]] is one of the most important sources for Turkic mythology and religion.

In the Turkic belief system, there was no [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of deities as in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[polytheism]].

He was known as y\u00fcce or yarat\u0131c\u0131 tengri (Creator God). After the Turks started to migrate and leave middle Asia and see monotheistic religions, Tengrism was changed from its pagan/polytheistic origins. The religion was more like Zoroastrianism after its change, with only two of the original gods remaining, Tengri, representing the good god and [[U\u00e7mag]] (a place like heaven or valhalla), while Erlik took the position of the bad god and hell. The words [[Tengri]] and [[Sky]] were synonyms. It is unknown how Tengri looks. He rules the fates of the entire people and acts freely. But he is fair as he awards and punishes. The well-being of the people depends on his will. Tengri worship is first attested in the [[Old Turkic]] [[Orkhon inscriptions]] of the early 8th century.\n\n===Other deities===\n[[Umay]] (The Turkic root um\u0101y originally meant 'placenta, afterbirth') is the goddess of fertility and virginity. [[Umay]] resembles earth-mother goddesses found in various other world religions and is the daughter of Tengri.\n\n[[\u00d6d Tengri]] is the god of time being not well-known, as it states in the Orkhon stones, \"\u00d6d tengri is the ruler of time\" and a son of K\u00f6k Tengri.\n\n[[Boz Tengri]], like \u00d6d Tengri, is not known much. He is seen as the god of the grounds and steppes and is a son of K\u00f6k Tengri.\n\n[[Kayra]] is the Spirit of God. Primordial god of highest sky, upper air, space, atmosphere, light, life and son of K\u00f6k Tengri.\n\n[[\u00dclgen]] is the son of Kayra and Umay and is the god of goodness. The Aru\u011f (Ar\u0131) denotes \"good spirits\" in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] mythology.

This might have led to or sourced from the term \"at-[[bey]]i\" (horse-lord).\n\nThe [[dragon]] (Evren, also Ebren), also expressed as a [[snake]] or [[lizard]], is the symbol of might and power.

Dragons also symbolize the god [[Tengri]] (Tanr\u0131) in ancient Turkic tradition, although dragons themselves were not worshiped as gods.\n\nThe World Tree or [[Tree of Life]] is a central symbol in Turkic mythology. According to the Altai Turks, human beings are actually descended from trees. According to the [[Yakuts]], White Mother sits at the base of the Tree of Life, whose branches reach to the heavens, where they are occupied by various supernatural creatures which have come to life there.

The name is derived from the [[German language|German]] ''zum rothen Schild'' (with the old spelling \"th\"), meaning \"at the red shield\", in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (in those days houses were designated not by numbers but by signs displaying different symbols or colours). A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms. The family's ascent to international prominence began in 1744, with the birth of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany.

There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them... A woman who planned to write a book entitled ''Lies about the Rothschilds'' abandoned it, saying: 'It was relatively easy to spot the lies, but it proved impossible to find out the truth.'\" He writes that, unlike the [[court Jew|court factor]]s of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed European noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence: \"Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob, almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs.\"<ref>Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', p.317.</ref> Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] in London; however, more recent research by [[Niall Ferguson]] indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties, including [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] in Paris, [[Carl Mayer von Rothschild]] in Naples and [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] in Frankfurt.<ref>''The House of Rothschild (Vol. 2): The World's Banker: 1849\u20131999'', Niall Ferguson (2000)</ref>\n\nAnother essential part of Mayer Rothschild's strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands, allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes. In about 1906, the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] noted: \"The practice initiated by the Rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other Jewish financiers, like the [[Bischoffsheim family|Bischoffsheims]], [[P\u00e9reire brothers|Pereires]], [[Joseph Seligman|Seligmans]], [[Lazard]]s and others, and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their Jewish confr\u00e8res, but with the banking fraternity in general. By this means, Jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the 19th century. The head of the whole group was the Rothschild family...\" It also states: \"Of more recent years, non-Jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method, and, on the whole, the control is now rather less than more in Jewish hands than formerly.\"<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'' c. 1906 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&letter=F&search=Finance Finance]</ref>\nMayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully [[arranged marriage]]s, often between first- or second-[[cousin marriage|cousins]] (similar to [[royal intermarriage]]).

Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1744\u20131812), first established a [[textile]] jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish [[N M Rothschild & Sons]] bank in London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDuring the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild family's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], therefore funding the war. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N. M. Rothschild & Sons' financial strength in the [[City of London]] became such that, by 1825\u201326, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity|liquidity]] crisis.\n\nNathan Mayer's eldest son, [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808\u20131879), succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel, the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of [[Egypt]]'s interest in the [[Suez Canal]]. The Rothschild bank also funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the development of the [[British South Africa Company]]. [[Leopold de Rothschild]] (1845\u20131917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] scheme at the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1873, [[de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res]] in France and N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and British Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the [[De Beers]] diamond mines in [[South Africa]], becoming its largest shareholders.\n\nThe London banking house continued under the management of [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] (1882\u20131942) and his brother [[Anthony Gustav de Rothschild]] (1887\u20131961), and then to [[Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] (b. 1931).

The 1934 Hollywood film titled ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'', starring [[George Arliss]] and [[Loretta Young]], recounted the life of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] and [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (both played by Arliss). Excerpts from this film were incorporated into the Nazi propaganda film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (''The Eternal Jew'') without the permission of the copyright holder. Another Nazi film, ''Die Rothschilds'' (also called ''Aktien auf Waterloo''), was directed by [[Erich Waschneck]] in 1940. A Broadway musical entitled ''[[The Rothschilds (musical)|The Rothschilds]]'', covering the history of the family up to 1818, was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] in 1971. [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathaniel Mayer (\"Natty\") Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild]] appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel ''[[Stone's Fall]]'', by [[Iain Pears]]. Mayer Rothschild is featured in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s novel ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' as a coin seller summoned to Le Havre by Jamie Fraser to appraise coins, prior to the establishment of the Rothschild dynasty, when Mayer is in his early 20s. The Rothschild name is mentioned by [[Aldous Huxley]] in his novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', among many names of historically affluent persons, scientific innovators and others. The character, named Morgana Rothschild, played a relatively minor role in the story. The name Rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\", which is based on a song from the [[Tevye]] the Dairyman stories, written in the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as ''Ven ikh bin Rotshild'', meaning \"If I were a Rothschild\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/tradition_lyrics_fiddler_on_the_roof.html|title=Fiddler On The Roof - Tradition Lyrics|website=www.lyricsmania.com}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the word \"Rothschild\" was throughout the 19th and 20th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth, neo-Gothic styles, and epicurean glamour.<ref>''The Rothschilds: Portrait of a Dynasty'', By Frederic Morton (1998), page 5</ref> The family also has lent its name to \"{{visible anchor|le [[go\u00fbt Rothschild]]}},\" a suffocatingly glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neo-Renaissance palaces, extravagant use of velvet and gilding, vast collections of armour and sculpture, a sense of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[horror vacui]], and the highest masterworks of art.

The name is derived from the [[German language|German]] ''zum rothen Schild'' (with the old spelling \"th\"), meaning \"at the red shield\", in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (in those days houses were designated not by numbers but by signs displaying different symbols or colours). A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms. The family's ascent to international prominence began in 1744, with the birth of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany. He was the son of [[Amschel Moses Rothschild]] (born circa 1710),<ref>{{NDB|22|131|133|Rothschild, Mayer Amschel|Pohl, Manfred}}</ref> a [[money changer]] who had traded with the [[House of Hesse|Prince of Hesse]]. Born in the \"[[Frankfurter Judengasse|Judengasse]]\", the [[ghetto]] of [[Frankfurt]], Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct [[business]]. The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to [[Psalms|Psalm]] 127: \"Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.\" The family motto appears below the shield: ''Concordia, Integritas, Industria'' (Unity, Integrity, Industry).<ref>{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.lcf-rothschild.com/en/groupe/rothschild/concordia.asp\n  | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024114837/http://www.lcf-rothschild.com/en/groupe/rothschild/concordia.asp\n  | archivedate = 24 October 2007\n  | title       = Concordia, Integritas, Industria \u2013 The Rothschilds \u2013 LCF Rothschild Group\n  | publisher   = Lcf-rothschild.com\n  | accessdate  = 8 July 2010\n  }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Waddesdon Manor and Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 649037.jpg|thumb|A Rothschild house, [[Waddesdon Manor]] in [[Waddesdon]], Buckinghamshire, England, donated to the National Trust by the family in 1957]]\n[[File:Haus der Rotschilds in der frankfurter Judengasse.jpg|thumb|House of the Rothschild family, Judengasse, Frankfurt]]\n[[File:\u0160ilhe\u0159ovice, okres Opava, z\u00e1mek (5).JPG|thumb|A house formerly belonging to the Viennese branch of the family (Schillersdorf Palace)]]\n[[File:Rothschild Schloss.jpg|thumb|[[:de:Schloss Rothschild|Schloss Hinterleiten]], one of the many palaces built by the Austrian Rothschild dynasty.

There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them... A woman who planned to write a book entitled ''Lies about the Rothschilds'' abandoned it, saying: 'It was relatively easy to spot the lies, but it proved impossible to find out the truth.'\" He writes that, unlike the [[court Jew|court factor]]s of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed European noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence: \"Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob, almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs.\"<ref>Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', p.317.</ref> Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] in London; however, more recent research by [[Niall Ferguson]] indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties, including [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] in Paris, [[Carl Mayer von Rothschild]] in Naples and [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] in Frankfurt.<ref>''The House of Rothschild (Vol. 2): The World's Banker: 1849\u20131999'', Niall Ferguson (2000)</ref>\n\nAnother essential part of Mayer Rothschild's strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands, allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes. In about 1906, the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] noted: \"The practice initiated by the Rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other Jewish financiers, like the [[Bischoffsheim family|Bischoffsheims]], [[P\u00e9reire brothers|Pereires]], [[Joseph Seligman|Seligmans]], [[Lazard]]s and others, and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their Jewish confr\u00e8res, but with the banking fraternity in general. By this means, Jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the 19th century. The head of the whole group was the Rothschild family...\" It also states: \"Of more recent years, non-Jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method, and, on the whole, the control is now rather less than more in Jewish hands than formerly.\"<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'' c. 1906 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&letter=F&search=Finance Finance]</ref>\nMayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully [[arranged marriage]]s, often between first- or second-[[cousin marriage|cousins]] (similar to [[royal intermarriage]]). By the late 19th century, however, almost all Rothschilds had started to marry outside the family, usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties.<ref name=\"Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin\">[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/aug/featkiss Go Ahead, Kiss Your Cousin] by Richard Conniff, From the August 2003 issue, published online 1 August 2003</ref>\nHis sons were:\n* [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]] (1773\u20131855): [[Frankfurt]], died childless as his fortune passed to the sons of Salomon and Calmann\n* [[Salomon Mayer von Rothschild|Salomon Mayer Rothschild]] (1774\u20131855): [[Vienna]]\n* [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] (1777\u20131836): [[London]]\n* [[Carl Mayer von Rothschild|Calmann Mayer Rothschild]] (1788\u20131855): [[Naples]]\n* [[James Mayer de Rothschild|Jakob Mayer Rothschild]] (1792\u20131868): [[Paris]]\n\nThe German family name \"Rothschild\" is pronounced {{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0281o\u02d0t\u0283\u026alt|}} in [[German language|German]], unlike {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|\u0252|\u03b8|(|s|)|t\u0283|a\u026a|l|d}} in [[English language|English]].

The family network was also to provide Nathan Rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers, giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of Rothschild still more invaluable to the British government.\n\nIn one instance, the family network enabled Nathan to receive in London the news of Wellington's victory at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] a full day ahead of the government's official messengers.<ref name=\"GrayOxNatBio\" /> Rothschild's first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him; he and his courier immediately took the news to the government.<ref name=\"GrayOxNatBio\">Victor Gray and Melanie Aspey, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24162 \"Rothschild, Nathan Mayer (1777\u20131836)\"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2006.

Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild]] (1744\u20131812), first established a [[textile]] jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish [[N M Rothschild & Sons]] bank in London.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nDuring the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild family's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], therefore funding the war. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N. M. Rothschild & Sons' financial strength in the [[City of London]] became such that, by 1825\u201326, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the [[Bank of England]] to enable it to avert a [[market liquidity|liquidity]] crisis.\n\nNathan Mayer's eldest son, [[Lionel de Rothschild]] (1808\u20131879), succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel, the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of [[Egypt]]'s interest in the [[Suez Canal]]. The Rothschild bank also funded [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the development of the [[British South Africa Company]]. [[Leopold de Rothschild]] (1845\u20131917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] scheme at the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1873, [[de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res]] in France and N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and British Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the [[De Beers]] diamond mines in [[South Africa]], becoming its largest shareholders.\n\nThe London banking house continued under the management of [[Lionel Nathan de Rothschild]] (1882\u20131942) and his brother [[Anthony Gustav de Rothschild]] (1887\u20131961), and then to [[Sir Evelyn de Rothschild]] (b. 1931). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn's retirement as head of N. M.

The [[Unification of Italy]] in 1861, with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschild's primary clients, eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank, due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term.

Excerpts from this film were incorporated into the Nazi propaganda film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (''The Eternal Jew'') without the permission of the copyright holder. Another Nazi film, ''Die Rothschilds'' (also called ''Aktien auf Waterloo''), was directed by [[Erich Waschneck]] in 1940. A Broadway musical entitled ''[[The Rothschilds (musical)|The Rothschilds]]'', covering the history of the family up to 1818, was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] in 1971. [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Nathaniel Mayer (\"Natty\") Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild]] appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel ''[[Stone's Fall]]'', by [[Iain Pears]]. Mayer Rothschild is featured in [[Diana Gabaldon]]'s novel ''[[Voyager (novel)|Voyager]]'' as a coin seller summoned to Le Havre by Jamie Fraser to appraise coins, prior to the establishment of the Rothschild dynasty, when Mayer is in his early 20s. The Rothschild name is mentioned by [[Aldous Huxley]] in his novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', among many names of historically affluent persons, scientific innovators and others. The character, named Morgana Rothschild, played a relatively minor role in the story. The name Rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\", which is based on a song from the [[Tevye]] the Dairyman stories, written in the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as ''Ven ikh bin Rotshild'', meaning \"If I were a Rothschild\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/tradition_lyrics_fiddler_on_the_roof.html|title=Fiddler On The Roof - Tradition Lyrics|website=www.lyricsmania.com}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the word \"Rothschild\" was throughout the 19th and 20th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth, neo-Gothic styles, and epicurean glamour.<ref>''The Rothschilds: Portrait of a Dynasty'', By Frederic Morton (1998), page 5</ref> The family also has lent its name to \"{{visible anchor|le [[go\u00fbt Rothschild]]}},\" a suffocatingly glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neo-Renaissance palaces, extravagant use of velvet and gilding, vast collections of armour and sculpture, a sense of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[horror vacui]], and the highest masterworks of art.

He is credited with laying the foundation of [[Islamic rulers in India|Muslim rule]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], which lasted for several centuries. He reigned over a territory spanning over parts of modern-day [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]], [[North India|Northern India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nMu'izz ad-Din took the city of [[Ghazni]] in 1173 to avenge the death of his ancestor [[Muhammad ibn Suri]] at the hands of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and used it as a launching-pad for expansion into northern India.<ref name=\"Iranica-Ghurids\">Encyclopedia Iranica, ''Ghurids'', C. Edmund Bosworth, Online Edition 2012, ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghurids LINK])</ref> In the meantime, he assisted his brother Ghiyath in his contest with the [[Khwarazmian Empire]] for the lordship of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in [[Western Asia]]. In 1175, Mu'izz captured [[Multan]] from the Hamid Ludi dynasty, which were Muslim [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], and also took [[Uch]] in 1175. He also annexed the Ghaznavid principality of [[Lahore]] in 1186, the last haven of his [[Persianised]] rivals.<ref name=\"Iranica-Ghurids\"/> After the death of Ghiyath in 1202, he became the successor of the Ghurid Empire and ruled until his assassination in 1206.\n\nA confused struggle then ensued among the remaining Ghuri leaders, and the Khwarizmi were able to take over the [[Ghurid Sultanate]] in about 1215. Though the Ghurids' empire was short-lived, and petty Ghurid states remained in power until the arrival of the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]], Mu'izz's conquests laid the foundations of Muslim rule in India. [[Qutbu l-Din Aibak]], a former slave ([[Mamluk]]) of Mu'izz, was the first [[Sultan]] of Delhi.\n\n== Early life ==\nMu'izz ad-Din Muhammad was born in 1149 in the Ghor region of Khorasan. The exact date of his birth is unknown. His father, [[Baha al-Din Sam I]], was the local ruler of the Ghor region at the time.<ref name=\"Iranica-Ghurids\"/> Mu'izz also had an elder brother named [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad]]. During their early life, Mu'izz and Ghiyath were imprisoned by their uncle [[Ala al-Din Husayn]], but were later released by the latter's son [[Sayf al-Din Muhammad]].<ref>''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 186.</ref> When Sayf died in 1163, the Ghurid nobles supported Ghiyath, and helped him ascend the throne. Ghiyath shortly gave Mu'izz control over Istiyan and Kajuran. However, the throne was challenged by several Ghurid chiefs; Mu'izz aided Ghiyath in defeating and killing a rival Ghurid chief named Abu'l Abbas.\n\n== Early campaigns ==\nGhiyath was then challenged by his uncle Fakhr al-Din Masud, who claimed the throne for himself, and had allied with Tadj al-Din Yildiz, the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] governor of [[Herat]], and [[Balkh]].<ref name=\"Bosworth112\"/> However, the coalition was defeated by Ghiyath and Mu'izz at Ragh-i Zar. The brothers managed to kill the Seljuq governor during the battle, and then conquered [[Zamindawar]], [[Badghis]], [[Gharjistan]], and [[Urozgan]]. [[Ghiyath]], however, spared Fakhr al-Din and restored him as the ruler of [[Bamiyan]]. Mu'izz, after returning from an expedition from Sistan, was shortly awarded with [[Kandahar]] by his brother. In 1173, the two brothers invaded [[Ghazni]], and defeated the [[Oghuz Turks]] who had captured the city from the [[Ghaznavids]]. Mu'izz was then appointed as the ruler of Ghazni.<ref name=\"Bosworth112\"/><ref name=\"India, The Page 54\"/>\n\nIn 1175, the two brothers conquered [[Herat]] from its Seljuq governor, Baha al-Din Toghril, and also managed to conquer [[Pushang]].

Mu'izz captured a fortress, [[Bathinda]] in present-day [[Punjab, India|Punjab state]] on the northwestern frontier of [[Prithviraj Chauhan|Prithv\u012br\u0101j Chauh\u0101n]]'s kingdom. After appointing a Qazi Zia-ud-Din as governor of the fortress,<ref>Cambridge History (Page 40)</ref> he received the news that Prithviraj's army, led by his vassal prince Govind Tai were on their way to besiege the fortress. The two armies eventually met near the town of [[Tarain]], 14 miles from [[Thanesar]] in present-day [[Haryana]]. The battle was marked by the initial attack of mounted Mamluk archers to which Prithviraj responded by counter-attacking from three sides and thus dominating the battle. Mu'izz mortally wounded Govind Tai in personal combat and in the process was himself wounded, whereupon his army retreated and Prithv\u012br\u0101j's army was deemed victorious.<ref>''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', Vol. I, ed.

According to [[Firishta]], the Rajput army consisted of 3,000 elephants, 300,000 cavalry and infantry (most likely a gross exaggeration).<ref>Satish Chandra, ''Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206\u20131526)'', 25.[https://books.google.com/books?id=L5eFzeyjBTQC&pg=PA26]</ref> [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]], stated Mu'izz brought 120,000 fully armored men to the battle in 1192.<ref>Satish Chandra, ''Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206\u20131526)'', 25.</ref>\n\nPrithviraj had called his banners but hoped to buy time as his banners (other Rajputs under him or his allies) had not arrived. Before the next day, Mu'izz attacked the Rajput army before dawn. Rajputs had a tradition of fighting from sunrise to sunset. Although they were able to quickly form formations, they suffered losses due to surprise attack before sunrise.

His armies, mostly under [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] generals such as [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]], continued to advance through northern India, raiding as far east as [[Bengal]]. Followed by his conquest of [[Delhi]].

Among the first to hear of this were Ghiyath and Mu'izz al-Din. Within weeks the two brothers had moved their armies westwards into Khorasan. Once they had captured [[Nishapur]], Mu'izz al-Din was sent on an expedition towards [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], but he let his troops get out of control and got little further than [[Gurgan]], earning criticism from Ghiyath which led to the only reported quarrel between the brothers.<ref>Ahmad Hasan Dani et al.

Mu'izz, who had quickly returned to Ghor from [[India]], obtained the support of Ghurid nobles, and was crowned as Sultan of the Ghurid Empire at [[Firozkoh|Firuzkuh]]. Just after his ascension, Muhammad II invaded his domains, and besieged [[Herat]]. Mu'izz managed to repel him from Herat and then pursued him to [[Khwarezm]], besieging [[Gurganj]], their capital. Muhammad desperately requested aid from the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]], who sent an army to aid Muhammad. Mu'izz, because of the pressure from the Kara-Khitans, was forced to relieve the siege and retreat.

He is credited with laying the foundation of [[Islamic rulers in India|Muslim rule]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], which lasted for several centuries. He reigned over a territory spanning over parts of modern-day [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]], [[North India|Northern India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nMu'izz ad-Din took the city of [[Ghazni]] in 1173 to avenge the death of his ancestor [[Muhammad ibn Suri]] at the hands of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] and used it as a launching-pad for expansion into northern India.<ref name=\"Iranica-Ghurids\">Encyclopedia Iranica, ''Ghurids'', C.

In 1175, Mu'izz captured [[Multan]] from the Hamid Ludi dynasty, which were Muslim [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], and also took [[Uch]] in 1175. He also annexed the Ghaznavid principality of [[Lahore]] in 1186, the last haven of his [[Persianised]] rivals.<ref name=\"Iranica-Ghurids\"/> After the death of Ghiyath in 1202, he became the successor of the Ghurid Empire and ruled until his assassination in 1206.\n\nA confused struggle then ensued among the remaining Ghuri leaders, and the Khwarizmi were able to take over the [[Ghurid Sultanate]] in about 1215. Though the Ghurids' empire was short-lived, and petty Ghurid states remained in power until the arrival of the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]], Mu'izz's conquests laid the foundations of Muslim rule in India. [[Qutbu l-Din Aibak]], a former slave ([[Mamluk]]) of Mu'izz, was the first [[Sultan]] of Delhi.\n\n== Early life ==\nMu'izz ad-Din Muhammad was born in 1149 in the Ghor region of Khorasan. The exact date of his birth is unknown. His father, [[Baha al-Din Sam I]], was the local ruler of the Ghor region at the time.<ref name=\"Iranica-Ghurids\"/> Mu'izz also had an elder brother named [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad]]. During their early life, Mu'izz and Ghiyath were imprisoned by their uncle [[Ala al-Din Husayn]], but were later released by the latter's son [[Sayf al-Din Muhammad]].<ref>''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', C.E. Bosworth, M.S. Asimov, p. 186.</ref> When Sayf died in 1163, the Ghurid nobles supported Ghiyath, and helped him ascend the throne. Ghiyath shortly gave Mu'izz control over Istiyan and Kajuran. However, the throne was challenged by several Ghurid chiefs; Mu'izz aided Ghiyath in defeating and killing a rival Ghurid chief named Abu'l Abbas.\n\n== Early campaigns ==\nGhiyath was then challenged by his uncle Fakhr al-Din Masud, who claimed the throne for himself, and had allied with Tadj al-Din Yildiz, the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] governor of [[Herat]], and [[Balkh]].<ref name=\"Bosworth112\"/> However, the coalition was defeated by Ghiyath and Mu'izz at Ragh-i Zar. The brothers managed to kill the Seljuq governor during the battle, and then conquered [[Zamindawar]], [[Badghis]], [[Gharjistan]], and [[Urozgan]]. [[Ghiyath]], however, spared Fakhr al-Din and restored him as the ruler of [[Bamiyan]]. Mu'izz, after returning from an expedition from Sistan, was shortly awarded with [[Kandahar]] by his brother. In 1173, the two brothers invaded [[Ghazni]], and defeated the [[Oghuz Turks]] who had captured the city from the [[Ghaznavids]]. Mu'izz was then appointed as the ruler of Ghazni.<ref name=\"Bosworth112\"/><ref name=\"India, The Page 54\"/>\n\nIn 1175, the two brothers conquered [[Herat]] from its Seljuq governor, Baha al-Din Toghril, and also managed to conquer [[Pushang]].

After appointing a Qazi Zia-ud-Din as governor of the fortress,<ref>Cambridge History (Page 40)</ref> he received the news that Prithviraj's army, led by his vassal prince Govind Tai were on their way to besiege the fortress. The two armies eventually met near the town of [[Tarain]], 14 miles from [[Thanesar]] in present-day [[Haryana]]. The battle was marked by the initial attack of mounted Mamluk archers to which Prithviraj responded by counter-attacking from three sides and thus dominating the battle. Mu'izz mortally wounded Govind Tai in personal combat and in the process was himself wounded, whereupon his army retreated and Prithv\u012br\u0101j's army was deemed victorious.<ref>''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', Vol. I, ed.

Before the next day, Mu'izz attacked the Rajput army before dawn. Rajputs had a tradition of fighting from sunrise to sunset. Although they were able to quickly form formations, they suffered losses due to surprise attack before sunrise.

Other early releases for the fledgling label included recordings by [[Big Walter Horton]] with [[Carey Bell]] and [[Fenton Robinson]].

In 1991, a 20th anniversary [[compilation album]] was issued.<ref name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\nSince its founding, Alligator Records has released over 250 blues and blues/rock albums, as well as a now-defunct [[reggae]] series.
