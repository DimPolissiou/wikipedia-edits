It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html|title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport|last=Moss|first=John|date=28 April 2009|website=Manchester 2002|publisher=Papillon Graphics AD 2013 Manchester|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html|archive-date=22 November 2015|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1085399|title=Pastscape - Stockport Castle|last=|first=|date=29 August 2015|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic Engand|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co-operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs.

It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"Trautmann The Biography\" /> Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999|last=Efs|first=Thomas|date=23 June 2006|website=European Football Statistics|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs.

It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"Trautmann The Biography\" /> Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999|last=Efs|first=Thomas|date=23 June 2006|website=European Football Statistics|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

{"title_page": "Road signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "'''Road signs in New Zealand''' are similar to those set by the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]]. While New Zealand is not a signatory to the convention, its [[road sign]]s are generally close in shape and function. New Zealand uses yellow diamond-shaped signs for warnings in common with [[Australia]], the Americas, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Japan]] and [[Thailand]]. Speed limit signs are a red circle with a white background and the limitation in black, and are in kilometres per hour. There are also some signs unique to New Zealand. Road signs in New Zealand are controlled by the [[NZ Transport Agency]] and are prescribed in the Land Transport Rule: Traffic Control Devices 2004 and set out in the ''Traffic Control Devices (TCD) Manual''.<ref name=\"New Zealand Transport Agency\">{{cite book | url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/traffic-control-devices-manual/sign-specifications/ | title=Traffic Control Devices Manual | publisher=New Zealand Transport Agency | accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMost of these signs were only introduced in 1987, replacing older-style signs with white text on black backgrounds - square with a red border for regulatory signs and diamond with a yellow border. The only signs that remained the same were the Stop sign and the speed limit sign (although the \"km/h\" legend from metrication was removed). Some of these signs can still be seen on some rural roads.\n\nNew Zealand [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]].\n\n==Regulatory==\nSpeed limits are posted in multiples of {{convert|10|km/h|mph|1|abbr=~}}, and range from {{convert|10|-|110|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, with 110&nbsp;km/h being the maximum legal speed for motor vehicles in New Zealand. The ''Manual of Traffic Signs and Markings'' specifies that [[#Permanent Warning|advisory speed]]s (PW-25) always end in digit \"5\", however there are some advisory speed signs that do not comply with the ''Manual'' and end in zero.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Charlton |first1=S.G. |last2=de Pont |first2=J.J. |title=Curve Speed Management |url=

[[Linearity|linear]] location referencing system for its State Highway network, nationwide.<ref>https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/location-ref-management-sys-manual/docs/SM051-part-b.pdf New Zealand Transport Agency LRMS Manual SM051 Retrieved 18-03-2019</ref> This assists roading contractors, safety auditors and emergency services in pin-pointing locations across the country. The LRMS features several types of signs and methods of reference. All KMP's are installed using a calibrated [[Odometer#Trip_meters|Trip Meter]] from the beginning of the road. ERP's however, are placed using land surveying equipment.\n\nAll LRMS signs are installed on the 'true left' side of the lane or carriageway, this is determined by the left hand side when facing the increasing direction, The increasing direction of travel is the direction in which positive measurements are made. Divided carriageways (roads with concrete berms or centrelines) have an Increasing (I) side and a Decreasing (D) side. This can be seen on LRMS signs in these areas.\n\n===Established Route Position (ERP)===\nEstablished Route Position signs are used to highlight a special location or bearing on the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, usually every 3km. They feature the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 3 metres. ERP signs are double-sided and feature a reflective green strip. They also have a small yellow triangle on the post pointing in the roads increasing direction.\n\n===Kilometre Marker Post (KMP)===\nKilometre Marker Post signs are used to highlight the progression along the highway, These are placed routinely along the carriageways, every 1000 metres. They feature the State Highway Shield, the current Reference Station and the number of kilometres from the beginning of that Reference Station. These are required by the NZTA to have an accuracy of less than 100 metres. KMP signs are on plastic, flexible posts. They are double-sided and feature a reflective black strip.\n\n===Reference Station (RS)===\nReference Station signs are placed at the change of a Reference Station, or beginning of a Highway. KMP and ERP signs are reset to zero at the beginning of each RS.\n<gallery>\nFile:Established Route Point Sign.jpg|'''ERP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 3km)\nFile:Kilometre Marker Post Sign.jpg|'''KMP Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 594, 1km)\nFile:Route Station Marker Sign.jpg|'''RS Sign''' (SH1, Route Station 591)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Speed limits in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Traffic signs}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Road signs by country|New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Fry1989", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:New Zealand road sign R1-8.1 (40) (obsolete) + R1-8.1 (obsolete).svg\u2192File:New Zealand road sign R1-8.1 (40) + R1-8.1 (1987\u20132016).svgEdit file name to add years of use.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_New_Zealand"}

It was less definitively bordered by the [[Loire River]] to the south, and [[Normandy]] and other French provinces to the east. The Duchy was established after the expulsion of [[Viking]] armies from the region around 939. The Duchy, in the 10th and 11th centuries, was politically unstable, with the dukes holding only limited power outside their own personal lands. The Duchy had mixed relationships with the neighbouring [[Duchy of Normandy]], sometimes allying itself with Normandy, and at other times, such as the [[Breton-Norman War]], entering into open conflict.\n\n[[Henry II of England]] invaded Brittany in the mid-12th century and became Count of Nantes in 1158 under a treaty with [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany|Duke Conan IV]]. Henry's son, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], became Duke through his marriage to [[Constance, Duchess of Brittany|Constance]], the hereditary Duchess. The [[Angevin kings of England|Angevins]] remained in control until the collapse of their empire in northern France in 1204. The French Crown maintained its influence over the Duchy for the rest of the 13th century. Monastic orders supported by the Breton aristocracy spread across the Duchy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and in the 13th, the first of the mendicant orders established themselves in Brittany's major towns. Civil war broke out in the 14th century, as rival claimants for the Duchy vied for power during the [[Breton War of Succession]], with different factions supported by England and France.\n\nThe independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]] in 1488. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, [[Anne of Brittany|Anne]], but King [[Charles VIII of France]] had her existing marriage annulled and then married her himself. As a result, the King of France acquired the title of Duke of Brittany - ''[[jure uxoris]]''. The Ducal crown became united with the French crown in 1532 through a vote of the [[Estates of Brittany]], after the death of Queen [[Claude of France]], the last sovereign duchess.  Her sons [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]] and then [[Henry II of France]] would in any case have created a [[personal union]] on the death of their father.\n\nFollowing the French Revolution, and as a result of the various republican forms of French government since 1792, the duchy was replaced by the French system of {{lang|fr|d\u00e9partements}} (or [[Departments of France|Departments]]) which continues under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic of France]]. In modern times the departments have also joined into administrative [[Regions of France|regions]]{{efn| The creation of regions in modern France occurred pursuant to the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982)}} although the [[Brittany (administrative region)|administrative region of Brittany]] does not encompass the entirety of the medieval duchy.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Kingdom of Brittany|List of rulers of Brittany}}\n[[File:Map Kingdom of Brittany 845-867-fr.svg|thumb|Brittany in the 9th century]]\nThe Duchy of Brittany that emerged in the early 10th century was influenced by several earlier polities.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=2}} Prior to the expansion of the Roman Empire into the region, [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes had occupied the [[Armorica]]n peninsula, dividing it into five regions that then formed the basis for the Roman administration of the area, and which survived into the period of the Duchy.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=2}} These Gallic tribes \u2013 termed the ''Armorici'' in Latin \u2013 had close relationships with the [[Britons (historical)|Britonnes]] tribes in Roman Britain.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=130}} Between the late 4th and the early 7th centuries, many of these Britonnes migrated to the Armorican peninsula, blending with the local people to form the later Britons,{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=128}} who eventually became the [[Bretons]].

Drogo's rule set the precedent for the role of a regent during the minority of a ducal heir. Throughout his reign, Drogo was under the shared regency of his uncle the Count of Blois, Theobald I (who entrusted the administration of the duchy to Wicohen, Archbishop of [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]], and the Count of Rennes [[Juhel Berengar]] as administrators), and his stepfather, the Fulk II, Count of Anjou.{{sfn|Bachrach| page=261}}\n\nUnder Drogo, the duchy continued to experience political instability and he was unable to sustain his line. Drogo died in 958. Two of Alan II's illegitimate sons, [[Ho\u00ebl I, Duke of Brittany|Ho\u00ebl]] and Guerich, attempted to act as Counts of Nantes and preserve their claim to duchy but were eventually unsuccessful. In 990 Juhel Berengar's son [[Conan I of Rennes|Conan I]], the grandson of Pascweten, became Duke and the title passed to the House of [[Rennes]]. Conan I ruled for only two years and died fighting against his brother-in-law [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou]] at the [[Battle of Conquereuil]] on 27 June 992. He was succeeded by his oldest son [[Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey I]]. Blois threatened Conan's succession. Duke Geoffrey I, a member of the House of Nantes, entered into a dynastic alliance with [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]] in a diplomatic double marriage between the two houses. The church-sanctioned marriage ceremonies were held at [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. Geoffrey I married [[Hawise of Normandy]], Richard II's sister; and Richard II married [[Judith of Brittany]], Geoffrey I's sister and Conan I's daughter.{{sfn|Crouch|2002|p=36}}\n\n===11th century===\n[[File:Alan III of Brittany (icon).jpg|thumb|Duke Alan III]]\nThe 11th century was marked by a failed alliance with Normandy. [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] challenged the Breton dukes, and they formed an alliance with the French king. \nThe death of Geoffrey I in 1008, allowed Richard II to intervene directly in Brittany during the minority of his nephew, [[Alan III, Duke of Brittany|Alan III]], against rebellious counts who attempted to take advantage of the youthful duke.{{sfn|Crouch|2002|p=36}} The guardianship would be reciprocated later when Alan III was named as one of the primary guardians of [[William I of England|William of Normandy]]. By designating Alan III as a guardian of William, Robert I was \"involving a close family member who would not compete with his heir\".{{sfn|Crouch|2002|p=36}} In his guardianship of Duke William, Alan III was allied with Count Gilbert and [[Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen]], William's uncles.{{sfn|Crouch|2002|p=36}} However, when Archbishop Robert died in 1037 instability surfaced.

Tension increased in Normandy following his death, with Count Gilbert dying shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Crouch|2002|p=36}} A rival faction in the guardianship of Normandy emerged, one that would intervene in Brittany, suppressing Alan III's heir, [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany|Conan II]], from claiming his inheritance.\n\nAt around eight years of age, Conan II succeeded his father Alan III as Duke of Brittany, with the ducal regency entrusted to Alan's brother [[Odo, Count of Penthi\u00e8vre]].<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>{{Better source|date=January 2013}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2013}} However, by the time Conan II reached his majority at age sixteen, around 1048, Odo refused to relinquish power. During the dynastic conflict between uncle and nephew, Hoel of Cornouaille supported Odo in suppressing Conan's inheritance. Odo was Ho\u00e8l's brother-in-law as he was married to Hoel's sister Agnes of Cornouaille. By 1057, Conan II captured and imprisoned Odo. He came to terms with Ho\u00e8l of Cornouaille later that year.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> Conan II faced numerous threats posed by the pro-Norman faction in Brittany, including revolts sponsored by William, Duke of Normandy for whom Conan's father had served as Guardian.{{sfn|Howarth|2008}} William supported challengers to Conan's authority, encouraging them to rebel against the Breton duke, his cousin.  William continued courting the family of Odo, who was imprisoned. In response, Conan promoted his own legitimate claim as Duke of Normandy over William, as the Catholic Church began preferring legitimate heirs born in church-sanctioned marriage over out-of-wedlock issue.{{sfn|Patterson|2004}} This rivalry led to war between Normandy and Brittany. \n{{Campaignox Breton-Norman War}}\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene20.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The attack on [[Dinan]], from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nThe 1064\u20131065 war between Brittany and Normandy (the Breton-Norman War) was sparked after Duke William supported the rebellion against Conan II led by [[Rivallon I of Dol]].<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> In 1065, before his invasion of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], William of Normandy warned his rivals in Brittany and Anjou to abstain from any attacks on his duchy, on the grounds that his mission bore the papal banner.{{sfn|Howarth|2008}} However, Conan II rebuffed the warning and declared that he would press any advantage against William.{{sfn|Patterson|2004}} While William plotted to take the English crown, Conan consolidated his authority in Brittany and planned to take advantage of William's absence to invade Normandy.{{sfn|Patterson|2004}} First, however, he needed to neutralize Anjou, another historic rival.

Duke William was widely suspected of organizing the assassination.{{sfn|Howarth|2008}}{{sfn|Patterson|2004}}\n\nWilliam the Conqueror successfully invaded England in 1066 with an army that included some Bretons. William was able to attract Bretons into his expeditionary army for the upcoming campaign to claim the English crown.,{{sfn|Crouch|2002|p=36}} perhaps in part because the Breton commanders in Duke William's army were the second-sons of Breton lords, such as [[Alain Le Roux]] (son of Eudas of Penthi\u00e8vre). The Bretons within the Conquest army represented at least three major groupings,{{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=3}} two of which would become relevant to the long-term future of the duchy. One group was represented by [[Ralph de Gael]], briefly the Earl of Suffolk. In 1075 he was among the leaders of a \"Breton revolt\".{{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=3}} Ralph escaped returning to Brittany where he also revolted against the Breton Duke before eventually reconciling with the duchy. To the south and west of England, William granted lands to groups of Breton nobles who were more fractious than united, whether in Brittany or in England. This group had no one singular leader who could serve a unifying role .{{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=4}} Their numbers included Herve of Leon, the viscount of Leon, who was briefly the Earl of Wiltshire. The third group were those nobles associated with the Richmond-Penthi\u00e8vre family. Odo of Penthi\u00e8vre was a principal antagonist of Conan II.{{Sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=3}} Under William I, at three of Odo of Penthi\u00e8vre's sons ([[Alan Rufus|Alan]], [[Stephen, Count of Tr\u00e9guier|Stephen]] and [[Brian of Brittany|Brien]]) were granted substantial lands in England, including the [[Honour of Richmond]], lands in Suffolk, and the Earldoms of Richmond and Cornwall.{{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=3}}\n\nAlso in 1066, [[Hawise, Duchess of Brittany|Hawise]] succeeded her brother Conan II as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. She married Ho\u00ebl of Cornouaille. Hoel ruled as [[Hoel II, Duke of Brittany]] and started the House of Kernev which continued to rule Brittany until 1156 (see below). Ho\u00ebl inherited a divided Brittany which was split into six largely independent regions: Rennes, Panthi\u00e8vre, L\u00e9on, Cornouaille, the Bro\u00ebrec, and Nantes.{{sfn|Everard|2000|p=17}} Ducal power was non-existent in Panthi\u00e8vre and L\u00e9on, and even in the rest of Brittany the duke's powers did not extend beyond his own personal lands.{{sfn|Everard|2000|pp=17-18}} The barons in Brittany did not feel that they were in any way [[vassal]]s of the duke, owing him service in exchange for their lands, and only attended the ducal courts when they felt it was in their own interests to do so.{{sfn|Everard|2000|p=19-20}}\n\n[[File:Sceau Alain Fregent.jpg|thumb|Seal of [[Alan IV, Duke of Brittany]]]]\nHowever, the historic rivalry between Brittany and Normandy resurfaced at the close of the 11th century.

However, a peace settlement was reached that same year and in the negotiations that followed Alan IV was forced into marriage with King William I's second daughter [[Constance of England]].<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\">[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BRITTANY.htm#_Toc172084366 Brittany Genealogy extracted February 1, 2008]</ref> The marriage ceremonies may have taken place in [[Bayeux]] in Normandy.

Hawise was married to count [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]]. In 1098, Alan IV joined the [[First Crusade]], leaving Brittany under the regency of his wife Ermengarde of Anjou until his return early in the 12th century. Ermengarde ruled from Nantes rather than Rennes, as it was closer to her home county of Anjou.\n\n===12th century===\n[[File:Conan IV de Bretagne.jpg|thumb|Seal of [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany]]]]\nAlan IV returned from Crusade in 1101. In 1112, Alan IV's son Conan III inherited Brittany on the abdication of his father, who retired to the [[Redon Abbey|monastery of Redon]]. By 1113, Conan III married Maude, an illegitimate daughter of King [[Henry I of England]]. With Maude he had three children, [[Hoel, Count of Nantes|Hoel]], [[Bertha, Duchess of Brittany|Bertha]], and Constance. During his reign he strengthened the rule of the duchy.\n\nDuring the [[The Anarchy|dynastic struggle]] between [[Stephen of England]] (Stephen of Blois) and the dispossessed [[Empress Matilda]], Conan III allied himself with King Stephen. Empress Matilda's unpopular marriage with [[Geoffrey V of Anjou]] was forced upon her by her father Henry I. It reflected the historic rivalry between Brittany, Normandy, and Anjou.\n\nConan III sought to counter [[Angevin Empire|Angevin influence]] and preserve Breton independence. In his alliance with Stephen, Conan III looked for greater influence with Stephen, who needed allies on the continent to out-flank Matilda. Matilda was able to consolidate power in Normandy and Anjou. Brittany's position to the west of the Angevin controlled territory exposed a wide frontier for Stephen to exploit against Matilda.\n\nIn 1138, Conan III's daughter, Bertha, was married to [[Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan of Penthi\u00e8vre]], a supporter of King Stephen. For his support, Stephan created Conan's son-in-law Alan as 1st [[Earl of Richmond]] in the second creation, a title previously held by Alan's uncle Alain Le Roux. Later, when Alan died in 1146, Bertha returned home to Brittany from England. On his death-bed in 1148, Conan III disinherited his son Hoel, Count of Nantes from succession to the duchy.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> With this surprise move, Bertha became his heiress and successor as hereditary Duchess of Brittany.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> However, Hoel was to retain the county of Nantes.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>\n\nDuchess Bertha, as [[dowager]] countess of Richmond, continued Brittany's alliance with Stephen's England against the Angevins. However this strategy became untenable after 1153, when Stephen's son Eustace died suddenly. Eustace's death provided an opportunity for Matilda's son, [[Henry II of England|Henry FitzEmpress]], to land an invasion army in England and press for his mother's claims. In the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], Stephen was forced to recognize Henry FitzEmpress as his heir, with Matilda abdicating her claim in her son's favour. The treaty exposed Brittany to retaliatory incursions from Henry FitzEmpress and his brother [[Geoffrey VI, Count of Anjou|Geoffery FitzEmpress]].\n\nOn the death of Bertha in early 1156, her son, [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany|Conan IV]], expected to inherit the ducal throne.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> However, he was denied his inheritance by his stepfather Odo, [[Porho\u00ebt|Viscount of Porho\u00ebt]] (also known as Odo II), Bertha's second husband; Odo II refused to relinquish his authority over Brittany.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> To consolidate his hold on power, Odo II entered into a pact with the disinherited Hoel, Count of Nantes, to divide Brittany between them. But at the same time, Hoel was under threat of rebellion in Nantes, sponsored by Geoffrey Fitzempress, and he could not send any aid to Eudas. Conan IV landed in Brittany and took Rennes, while his ally Raoul de Foug\u00e8res captured and imprisoned Eudas.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> Conan IV was formally enthroned as Duke of Brittany in Rennes. While Conan IV was consolidating his inheritance in 1156, Geoffrey FitzEmpress successfully took Nantes from Hoel.\n\nUpon Geoffrey's death in 1158, Conan IV seized Nantes, reuniting the Duchy once again. However, Henry II, now King of England, seized the Earldom of Richmond, Conan's paternal inheritance. Henry demanded the return of Nantes, and when he obtained control of it from Conan IV, became the Count of Nantes, without obligation to the Duke of Brittany (later dukes would eventually reunite Nantes to Brittany).\n\nHenry II of England continued to stoke revolts and rebellions in Brittany against Conan IV. In response, Conan IV took the Breton counties of [[Tr\u00e9guier]] and [[Guingamp]] from his uncle Count Henri, a supporter of Henry II of England.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> Richmond was returned to Conan IV later that year in an agreement reached with Henry II of England.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>\nBy 1160 Conan was forced to yield to Henry. In the peace negotiations which followed, Conan was obliged to marry Henry's cousin, [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Duchess of Brittany|Margaret of Scotland]], in 1160.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>\n\nLater, Conan IV was faced with additional revolts from barons, possibly sponsored by Henry II. Conan appealed to Henry II for aid to end the revolts. For his aid Henry II insisted on the betrothal of Conan's only daughter and heiress [[Constance, Duchess of Brittany|Constance]] to Henry's son [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey Plantagenet]], continuing the policy of interweaving the Breton succession with the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]'s succession. \n[[File:Territorial Conquests of Philip II of France.png|thumb|France's influence grows under Philip II]]\nUpon her father's abdication in 1166, Constance became duchess, although Henry II held the Duchy until Constance married Geoffrey. Geoffrey and Constance ruled jointly until 1186, when Geoffrey was [[List of horse accidents|stamped to death]] in a riding accident during a [[tournament]] in Paris. Constance thereafter ruled the Duchy on her own. Henry II of England next arranged for Constance to marry [[Ranulph de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester]] on 3 February 1188 or 1189. Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by Richard I as King of England. Lacking a male heir, King [[Richard I of England]] officially proclaimed his nephew, Constance's son, [[Arthur I of Brittany]], as his heir presumptive in a treaty signed with [[Philip Augustus]] and [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Sicily]].\n\nTo promote her son's position and inheritance, Constance, Duchess of Brittany included Arthur in the government of Brittany in 1196. The same year, Constance's marriage with Ranulph deteriorated, with Ranulph imprisoning Constance. Her imprisonment sparked rebellion across Brittany on her behalf. Ranulph bowed to growing pressure and had the Duchess released in 1198. Once back in Brittany, Constance had her marriage to Ranulph annulled in 1199 (there was no issue from this marriage). Later that year, Constance took [[Guy, Duke of Brittany|Guy of Thouars]] as her 'second' husband at [[Angers]]. Throughout these years, Constance advised her son Arthur towards a French alliance, pursuing the policy of her late husband Geoffrey II, despite his designation as Richard I's heir. In Constance bore Guy of Thouars two or three daughters.{{efn|The existence of Constance and Guy's third daughter is still disputed.

When Richard I died in 1199, Philip agreed to recognize [[Arthur of Brittany]] as count of Anjou, Maine, and Poitou, in exchange for Arthur swearing fealty to him, and thereby becoming a direct vassal of France. However, in 1202, 15-year-old Arthur was captured by the English while besieging [[Mirebeau]]. By 1203, the imprisoned Arthur was transferred to [[Rouen]], under the charge of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]], the court favorite of King John. Arthur vanished mysteriously in April 1203. Arthur's legal successor was [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor of Brittany]]. However John of England had Eleanor captured and imprisoned at [[Corfe Castle]] in [[Dorset]].\n\nRecognizing that John of England could have Eleanor married to a vassal loyal to England, who would rule Brittany through her, Philip II  formally recognized Constance's infant daughter Alix as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. Initially Alix's father Guy of Thouars acted as regent. Philip II of France was maneuvering to keep Brittany within his sphere of influence. The marriage of the infant Alix to Capetian cadet [[Peter of Dreux|Pierre Mauclerc]] in 1213, began the new [[House of Dreux]]. After Guy of Thouars' regency, Alix ruled as nominal duchess with her husband [[Peter I, Duke of Brittany|Pierre]] as Duke ''jure uxoris''. In 1214, King John sent an expedition into France, in part to establish Eleanor as his puppet duchess, but after his defeat also recognized Alix and Peter as rulers of the Duchy. Eleanor was kept captive in England until her death in 1241, ending the line of Geoffrey II.\n\nIn 1235, the stage was set for the next century's [[Breton War of Succession]] when [[Peter I, Duke of Brittany|Peter I]] dispossessed the heir of the Penthi\u00e8vre Dynasty in order to give the countship of Penthi\u00e8vre to his second child, [[Yolande of Brittany|Yolande]].\n\nBeginning in the 13th century, the Duchy of Brittany experienced nearly a century of peace. Peter I continued as Regent for a time for his son [[John I, Duke of Brittany|John I]]. When John I reached his majority, Peter I ceded him the Ducal crown and left Brittany on Crusade.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} John I married [[Blanche of Navarre, Duchess of Brittany|Blanche of Navarre]]. Upon the death of his sister Yolande of Brittany, John I seized the countship of Penthi\u00e8vre for himself. John I in turn was succeeded by his son [[John II, Duke of Brittany|John II]]. John II married [[Beatrice of England]] and ruled until 1305.\n\n===14th century===\n[[File:Battle of Auray.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Auray in 1364 resulting in victory for the House of Montfort in the Breton War of Succession]]\n{{Campaignbox Breton War of Succession}}\nIn the 14th century, the Breton War of Succession ensued; the title of Duke passed to the House of Montfort. John II died in 1305 and was succeeded by this son, [[Arthur II, Duke of Brittany|Arthur II]] as Duke. Arthur II's ruled independently of the French crown. His reign included several administrative innovations including the creation of several \"battles\" or districts meant to provide a stronger defense, and the creation of the [[Estates of Brittany]], marking a critical step towards a parliamentary form of government. Arthur II's reign is also distinguished by his two marriages, the first to Mary of Limoges and the second to [[Yolande of Dreux, Queen of Scotland]].\n\nArthur II's son by Mary of Limoges, [[John III, Duke of Brittany|John III]] became Duke but failed to produce a living heir, despite three marriages. John III's succession efforts were focused on his attempts to deny his half brother, [[John of Montfort]] from inheriting the Ducal Crown. He attempted to name the King of France as heir in an act that defied all precedents to maintain Brittany as an independent sovereign state. The Breton nobles predictably rejected the attempt and Brittany's independence continued. John III died in 1341 without a succession plan.\n\nJohn III's half-brother, John of Montfort, claimed the title of Duke, but his claim was rejected by the King of France who favored the competing claims of [[Joanna of Dreux|Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre]]{{efn| Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre was John of Montfort's half-niece by his half brother, Guy. John III, Guy and John of Montfort were all sons of Arthur II.}} and her husband [[Charles of Blois]], who also claimed the Ducal title.  The Breton War of Succession between the claimants ensued when John of Montfort refused to cede his rights in their favor. The Breton War of Succession was fought from 1341 to 1364 between these two Breton houses, the [[House of Blois|House of Blois Ch\u00e2tillon]] and the [[Montfort of Brittany|House of Montfort]].\n\n[[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois Ch\u00e2tillon]] claimed the title Duke of Brittany from 1341 to his death.\n\nDuring the war, John of Montfort was imprisoned in Paris. Hostilities abated for a short time, and he was freed under the Treaty of Malestroit in 1341. He died in 1345, leaving his son John as the Montfort claimant to the ducal title. John's widowed Duchess Consort, [[Joanna of Flanders]], acted as regent for her son John and continued the war in his name. The House of Montfort emerged victorious with substantial help from English allies{{efn| At the beginning of the conflict when John de Montfort was nearly routed by Charles of Blois, John's wife [[Joanna of Flanders]] was able to successfully defend Brest and turn the tide of the war with the assistance of the English naval forces led by [[Walter de Manny, 1st Baron Manny]]. When Jean de Montfort's son launched his attack on the forces of Charles de Blois, his British allies were led by [[John Chandos]]. Years after the Breton Civil War, John IV returned from exile in England a second time with British allies led by [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas Woodstock]].}} Under the terms of their surrender,  Joan was allowed to keep Penthi\u00e8vre and retained the title Duchess of Brittany for life. Under the Treaties of Guerande, [[Salic law|semi-Salic]] succession was agreed under which, if the reigning member of the House of Montfort died without legitimate male issue, the eldest direct legitimate male descendant of Joan would inherit the Ducal crown of Brittany. [[John IV, Duke of Brittany]] ruled with difficulty after the Breton civil war, and was forced into exile in England for a second time in 1373 where he lived in the court of [[Edward III, King of England|Edward III]].\n\nThe House of Montfort's victory strengthened the position of England in [[Brittany]]. One of the effects of the Breton War of Succession was to intensify the rivalries between England and France with Brittany as the contested prize. The Houses of Penthi\u00e8vre and Montfort were united in the sense of their opposition to the attempted annexation of Brittany by [[Charles V of France]] as a consequence of this Breton civil war. The French king sent the [[Constable of France]], [[Bertrand de Guesclin]], into Brittany with the goal of uniting it to the French crown. When the Breton nobles rebelled against this proposed unification, John IV was able to return from England, assisted once again by a strong army including his English ally, and was able to re-establish his rule.{{efn|John IV relied on two English military leaders to execute his two military campaigns to regain the Duchy, John Chandos and Thomas Woodstock.}} The deposed Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre joined in the efforts to return John IV to Brittany to defend the Duchy against the advances of Charles V. John IV had three wives but only his third wife, Joan of Navarre, bore him children. John IV died on 1 November 1399. Joan remained a widow for four years acting as a regent for her son John V.{{efn|According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', affection developed between Joanna and Henry Bolingbroke (the future King Henry IV) while he resided at the Breton court during his banishment from England. In 1403, Joan became the second wife of [[Henry IV, King of England]].}} The House of Montfort's difficulties in maintaining the Ducal crown continued when [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] succeeded his father. By 1417, the Duke of Brittany were styled \"rulers by the Grace of God\".{{sfn|Small|2009|p=18}}\n\n===15th century===\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|[[Hundred Years' War]] evolution. {{Legend|#FFFF80|French}}{{Legend|#B2B2B2|English}}\n{{Legend|#868686|Burgundian}}\nEngland and France competed for influence over the Duchy of Brittany during the war.]]\nThe intrigues and contests between the House of Montfort and the House of Penthi\u00e8vre continued well after the Breton War of Succession. John IV's successor, John V, Duke of Brittany, was kidnapped by the son of [[Joan, Duchess of Brittany|Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre]]. He was freed through the efforts of his wife the Duchess of Brittany, [[Joan of France, Duchess of Brittany|Joan of France]] and the remaining wealth of the Penthi\u00e8vre family was confiscated. John V was succeeded first by his son [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany|Francis I]]. Since Francis I had no male heir, he was followed by a younger son of John V, [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany|Peter II]]. When Peter II died without issue, the Ducal Crown passed to his uncle [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Arthur III]]. He was, in turn, succeeded by his nephew [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany|Francis II]].\n\nThe reign of Francis II was notable in many respects including two wars against [[Charles VIII of France]], both of which were lost, the establishment of the [[Parlement of Brittany]], and the death of all of his children save for his daughter [[Anne of Brittany]]. Francis II's rule as Duke was also marked by continued intrigues with the House of Penthi\u00e8vre. Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre's later descendants, the Brosse line of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre through [[Jean de Brosse]], were denied their claims to the Ducal Crown in the 15th century, possibly as an alteration of the rules of inheritance by the then Duke of Brittany Francis II. The wars with France eventually cost Ducal Brittany its independence, while the Parlement ensured a degree of autonomy that would continue through the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]]. That Francis II's sole heir was his daughter Anne assured an inheritance contest on his death that would pit the power of the House of Montfort against conflicting treaty obligations to the House of Penthi\u00e8vre in Brittany, and the House of Valois in France, and would also be a test of the Breton tradition of semi-Salic law in which a daughter could be the principal inheritor. The position of the King of France dominated these events through two wars. After the first war, under the [[Treaty of Verger]], the marriage of Francis II's sole surviving issue, Anne, would need to be approved by the King of France.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFrancis II worked to seek a husband for Anne who would be strong enough to defend Brittany from further influence from the French Crown. Duchesse Anne of Brittany was initially betrothed to [[Edward V of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]], the son of [[Edward IV of England]], but upon the king's death his son disappeared and the English throne passed to [[Richard III of England]]. Anne was then married to [[Maximillian I of Austria]].\n\nHowever, relations between Brittany and France deteriorated and Francis II was forced into the last Franco-Breton war, which he lost. At the end of the second war between Francis II and Charles VIII of France, the so-called [[Mad War]], Anne of Brittany's first marriage to Maximillian was declared illegal on the basis that the French King had not approved it under the terms of the Treaty of Verger. Anne was married to Charles VIII of France in a ceremony that was validated by [[Pope Innocent III]]. Once they were married, Charles did not allow Anne to use the title Duchess of Brittany. However, upon his death, Anne returned to Brittany and took steps to return the Duchy to independent rule under herself as Duchess. The children of Charles and Anne did not reach adulthood and this presented a new Breton succession problem as well as one for France. Both succession issues were solved upon Anne's marriage to [[Louis XII of France]] but at the cost of restoring and furthering the independence of Brittany.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 1499, the birth of Anne of Brittany's sole heir with Louis XII of France, her daughter [[Claude of France]], introduced a new succession issue in Brittany and France. In Brittany, with the provisions of the Treaty of Guerande set aside by the Estates of Brittany, Claude could claim to be Duchess of Brittany in her own right, as several Duchesses by right of inheritance had done over the centuries. France, however operated under strict Salic law, requiring a male heir. The French requirement was solved upon Claude's marriage to [[Francis I of France]]. The birth of Claude's sons Francis (who became [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]], as well as the Dauphin of France) and [[Henry II of France]] represented a resolution to these contrasting succession issues but accelerated the loss of Brittany's independence and the eventual disappearance of the Ducal title as an independent sovereign Ducal crown.\n\n===16th century===\n[[File:Portrait of unknown, formerly known as Claude de France (Corneille de Lyon, 1535-1540, Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|[[Claude of France|Claude, Duchess of Brittany]]]]\nAnne of Brittany's second marriage making her Queen Consort of France continued into the 16th century; and she died in 1514. Queen Claude of France, reigned as duchess of Brittany from 1514, but under her husband king Francis was not able to maintain an independent government in the Duchy of Brittany. Claude's son Francis I was invested as duke of Brittany. But this act meant next to nothing to advance Breton independence. Some members of the [[Counts and dukes of Penthi\u00e8vre|House of Penthi\u00e8vre]] were appointed as royal governors of Brittany by the French. Their failure to reassert their Ducal rights successfully hastened the merger of the Ducal crown into the Kingdom of France. At this time the title Duke of Brittany began to lose independent sovereign status and began to become only titular in character; the Breton region lost independence and became a province of France.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Kings of France considered that the Duchy of Brittany was feudally a part of their Kingdom of France (i.e. it was within the traditional borders of the realm, and the King of France was deemed to be overlord of the Duchy). In practice, however, the Duchy of Brittany was a largely independent sovereign state.\n\nThe independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, Anne, but King Charles VIII of France, determined to bring the territory under royal control, had her marriage annulled and then forced her to marry him in a series of actions that were acknowledged by the Pope. As a result, the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Brittany were placed in the personal union of their marriage, and the King of France also held the title of Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris''. During their marriage, the Charles VIII prohibited Anne of Brittany from using the title Duchess of Brittany, and imposed a Royal Governor from the House of Penthi\u00e8vre on the Duchy.\n\nLegally, however, the Duchy remained separate from France proper; the two titles were linked only by the marriage of the King and Queen and, in 1498 when Charles VIII died childless, the title ''Duke of Brittany'' remained with Anne, rather than passing to the heir of France, Louis XII. Anne of Brittany returned to Brittany and began to re-establish an independent sovereign rule. However, the new French king, Louis XII married Anne himself, and so the King of France was once more Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris''. Legally, Brittany still remained distinct, and its future remained dependent on the Ducal bloodline, now held by the House of Montfort. When Anne died, Brittany passed to her daughter and heiress, Claude, rather than remaining with the King of France, her father.\n[[File:Franciszek III Breto\u0144ski.JPG|thumb|left|[[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]]]]\nClaude married the future King of France, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. By this marriage, and through the succession to the French crown, the King of France became Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris'' once more.\nClaude's death in 1524 separated the Duchy from the crown again, and (it would transpire) for the final time. Because Claude, like her mother, was sovereign Duchess, the title of 'Duke' did not remain with her husband, but instead passed to her son, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis III of Brittany]], who was also [[Dauphin of France]]. Legally, the Crown and Duchy were again separate, but the Duke was a child, and the Duchy had been governed as an integral part of France for years; the King had little trouble in maintaining royal control over the Duchy. Breton independence was effectively ended when in 1532 the Estates of Brittany proclaimed the perpetual union of Brittany with the French crown. Legally, the Duchy was part of France.\n\nFrancis III remained Duke of Brittany, but died without attaining the French crown in 1536. He was succeeded by his brother Henry, who was the first person to become both King of France and Duke of Brittany in his own right. Any trace of Breton independence ended with the ascension of Henry, as Henry II of France, to the French throne. The French Crown and Breton Duchy were now united by inheritance, and the merging of Brittany into France was thus completed. Henry II was not crowned separately as Duke of Brittany. However Henry attempted to create a separate legal status for Brittany vis-a-vis the Kingdom of France similar to the position of the Duchy of Cornwall to the Kingdom of Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In some histories it is meant to be a ducal territory he would attempt to preserve for himself and his heirs if he was to lose the French Crown. This attempt at legal separation did not survive his reign.\n\nWhen [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (last direct male from Claude of France) died, Brittany passed as part of the Crown to the next heir of France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], rather than to Claude's most senior heirs (either [[Henry II, Duke of Lorraine]] or Infanta [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]]). While these nobles were technically Henry's heirs, there were problems with both claimants to the Ducal crown. The most important issue was that the crown, as a Sovereign Duke, could not be separated from that of the French Crown. Meanwhile, the French Crown and the Spanish Crown had been permanently separated beginning with the reign of Philip of Spain.\n\nIn 1582, Henry III of France, last living male-line grandson of [[Claude, Duchess of Brittany]], made [[Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc\u0153ur]], his brother-in-law and a leader of [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], [[governor of Brittany]]. Invoking the hereditary rights of his wife Marie de Luxembourg, he endeavoured to make himself independent in that province from 1589 onward, and organized a government at Nantes, proclaiming their young son [[Philippe Louis de Lorraine-Merc\u0153ur]] \"prince and duke of Brittany\". (Infanta Isabella was the eldest daughter of the eldest sister of Henry III but being female weakened her status, and her position as Infanta all but blocked inheritance to the Breton Duchy.) Through maternal ancestry he was the direct [[Primogeniture|primogenitural heir]] of Duchess Joan, of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre, wife of [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]]. Merc\u0153ur organized a government at Nantes, supported by the Spaniards. He prevented Henry IV's attempts to subjugate Brittany until 20 March 1598, when Merc\u0153ur was forced to surrender. Henry IV then had one of his own illegitimate sons marry the young daughter of the Merc\u0153urs, and thereby assured direct French control of the province. Merc\u0153ur subsequently went in exile to [[History of Hungary#Decline (1490\u20131526)|Hungary]].\n\nThe title ''Duke of Brittany'' largely ceased to be used as a title of the King of France. When it appeared the title was bestowed by the King of France to one of his direct descendants, and was in any event titular in status.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\n[[File:Louis de bourbon (1707-1712).jpg|thumb|[[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Brittany|Louis, the last Duke of Brittany]]]]\nUnder the Kings of France the nobles of Brittany continued to enjoy the privileges that had been accorded them by the various independent Dukes of Brittany. Brittany's Celtic legal traditions were maintained, to a degree, and the Estates of Brittany and the Parlement of Brittany were kept separate from the French parliamentary system in Paris. The Breton noble privileges protected in this parliamentary system included exemption from taxes, representation in the Breton Parlement, and the maintenance of Breton titles in the tradition of the Duchy rather than that of France, including, in theory, the application of Brittany's form of semi-Salic, rather than pure Salic Law to the succession issues.\n\nAfter [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], the title Duke of Brittany was not used for over 200 years. The title Duke of Brittany reappeared when a great-grandson of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was named [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Brittany|Louis, Duke of Brittany]]; He was the last holder of the title prior to the French Revolution and did not live to inherit the French throne. At his death the title in essence became defunct.\n\nClaims on the titular Ducal title by Spanish nobles at various times were not to be considered legitimate by the French, and its use by Louis XIV demonstrated that as the title had merged into the crown of France only the King could assert the title himself or bestow it on another. Louis XIV's actions with regard to the Ducal title also underscored the fact that the Spanish or cadet branch of the House of Bourbon had relinquished all French claims and inheritance rights as a condition of gaining the crown of Spain under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].\n\nShortly before the French Revolution the leaders of the Parlement of Brittany issued Remonstrances to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], in part to remind the King of his duties as Duke and to preserve the privileges of the Breton people under the Treaty of Union. The King's response was to close the Breton Parlement. The [[Remontrances]] were delivered to the King by Members of the Breton Parlement led by the Comte de Saisy de Kerampuil, and others.\n\nWhen French King Louis XVI dissolved the Breton Parlement he did so to strengthen his claims as an absolute monarch (where a representative parliament was not necessary). He also did this to advance a centralized federal form of government, but in so doing preserved the nature of the Brittany's autonomy by acknowledging its nobles' traditional privileges, and acted as the Duke of Brittany.\n\nThe Breton Parlement has not met since this event. During the French Revolution, the legal state of Brittany was dissolved by the French National Assembly. The province of Brittany was divided  and replaced by the 5 departements that have continued in the modern French Republic.\n\n==Society, culture and governance==\n\n===Economy===\nThe north and western parts of the territory relied on a pastoral farming economy; the south-east enjoyed warmer weather and conducted mixed-arable and pastoral farming, based around small holdings.{{sfn|Smith|1992|pp=25-26}} The region enjoyed a strong and diverse maritime economy including active ports of trade and fishing. Over the time of the Duchy, many currencies were present, and the Dukes of Brittany sometimes minted their own coins. Gold and silver were also used for trade.\n\n===Folklore and Legends===\n[[File:Tristan Iseult fountain Louvre OA10958.jpg|thumb|14th-century depiction of the Breton romance ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'']]\nIn the 12th century, legends of [[Conan Meriadoc]] became popular in North-West Europe.

He convoked the first Estates of Brittany in 1309. In addition to creating a parliamentary body, Arthur II added the innovation of including the [[Estates of the realm|Third Estate]].\n\nThese parliamentary bodies figured prominently in the Breton War of Succession and helped to resolve the Ducal Claims of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre in favor of the House of Montfort. The Estates of Brittany acted during the reign of Francis II, of the House of Montfort, to nullify provisions of the Treaty of Guerande and to confirm that [[Anne, Duchess of Brittany|Anne]] was Francis II's sole and legal Ducal heir. The action in favor of Anne, Duchess of Brittany effectively ended the Ducal claims of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre.\n\nThe Parlement of Brittany was founded in 1485 by Francis II and first met in Vannes. Later the Parlement was moved to Rennes where the Parlement building remains in use to today as a Court of Justice. Initially the Parlement of Brittany functioned as a sovereign court of justice and was designed, among other things, to protect the ancient rights of the Breton nobles. Many of its members were also members of the Estates of Brittany.\n\nAfter the Duchy of Brittany was merged into the Crown of France, the Parlement of Brittany took on greater responsibility to manage and preserve the rights of the Duchy as separate from the Kingdom of France. While Henry II of France  held all rights as Duke of Brittany he was neither frequently present in the Duchy nor entirely inclined to preserve the independent actions of its parliament. As the Kings of France moved to greater centralized authority under Louis XIV of France, Louis XV of France, and Louis XVI of France, tensions between the Kingdom and the Duchy grew.  In September 1771, the Parlement was closed by order of Louis XVI of France; the National Assembly subsequently issued a French law to close the Parlement in 1790. The Parlement of Brittany met and they established that these actions had no force of law based on the Breton laws and traditions on which the Parliament had been founded. Notwithstanding this claim, the Parlement of Brittany has not met since 1790.\n\n===Richmondshire===\nNobles from the Breton Ducal family who fought for William the Conqueror in 1066 were the first Lords of Richmond, and eventually the first in a series of [[Earl of Richmond|Earls of Richmond]] in England. [[Alan Rufus]] was among William's Earls and built [[Richmond Castle]]. Conan III allied himself with [[Stephen of England]] in his war against the dispossessed [[Empress Matilda]]. For his support, Stephen created Conan's son-in-law Alan 1st Earl of Richmond.\n\n[[Arthur III of Brittany]] (August 24, 1393 \u2013 December 26, 1458), was known as Arthur de Richemont, and was the titular Earl of Richmond. For eleven months at the very end of his life, Arthur was both Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort, after inheriting those titles upon the death of his nephew. After the death of Arthur's father, John V of Brittany, the English refused to recognize his heirs as earls. Nevertheless, the Breton Dukes continued to style themselves \"Count of Richmond\", while the English title was given to [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]]  (1389\u20131435) in 1414.\n\nFrancis II was host to the Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII of England when he fled England to seek safety from Richard III of England. Brittany's possessions in Richmond passed indisputably to England when [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]], surrendered his rights to Henry, thereby permitting him to take the title Earl of Richmond.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:PanoDonjonDinanM.jpg|thumb|The 14th-century [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dinan]], the ''Keep of the Duchesse Anne'']]\nThere is no modern-day Duchy of Brittany. The Duchy of Brittany and the sovereign title and role of the Duke of Brittany no longer exist in the modern [[Fifth French Republic|5th Republic of France]]. The [[Breton Parlement]] no longer exists. Its seat was in Rennes.

It was less definitively bordered by the [[Loire River]] to the south, and [[Normandy]] and other French provinces to the east. The Duchy was established after the expulsion of [[Viking]] armies from the region around 939. The Duchy, in the 10th and 11th centuries, was politically unstable, with the dukes holding only limited power outside their own personal lands. The Duchy had mixed relationships with the neighbouring [[Duchy of Normandy]], sometimes allying itself with Normandy, and at other times, such as the [[Breton-Norman War]], entering into open conflict.\n\n[[Henry II of England]] invaded Brittany in the mid-12th century and became Count of Nantes in 1158 under a treaty with [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany|Duke Conan IV]]. Henry's son, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], became Duke through his marriage to [[Constance, Duchess of Brittany|Constance]], the hereditary Duchess. The [[Angevin kings of England|Angevins]] remained in control until the collapse of their empire in northern France in 1204. The French Crown maintained its influence over the Duchy for the rest of the 13th century. Monastic orders supported by the Breton aristocracy spread across the Duchy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and in the 13th, the first of the mendicant orders established themselves in Brittany's major towns. Civil war broke out in the 14th century, as rival claimants for the Duchy vied for power during the [[Breton War of Succession]], with different factions supported by England and France.\n\nThe independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]] in 1488. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, [[Anne of Brittany|Anne]], but King [[Charles VIII of France]] had her existing marriage annulled and then married her himself. As a result, the King of France acquired the title of Duke of Brittany - ''[[jure uxoris]]''. The Ducal crown became united with the French crown in 1532 through a vote of the [[Estates of Brittany]], after the death of Queen [[Claude of France]], the last sovereign duchess.  Her sons [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]] and then [[Henry II of France]] would in any case have created a [[personal union]] on the death of their father.\n\nFollowing the French Revolution, and as a result of the various republican forms of French government since 1792, the duchy was replaced by the French system of {{lang|fr|d\u00e9partements}} (or [[Departments of France|Departments]]) which continues under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic of France]]. In modern times the departments have also joined into administrative [[Regions of France|regions]]{{efn| The creation of regions in modern France occurred pursuant to the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982)}} although the [[Brittany (administrative region)|administrative region of Brittany]] does not encompass the entirety of the medieval duchy.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Kingdom of Brittany|List of rulers of Brittany}}\n[[File:Map Kingdom of Brittany 845-867-fr.svg|thumb|Brittany in the 9th century]]\nThe Duchy of Brittany that emerged in the early 10th century was influenced by several earlier polities.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=2}} Prior to the expansion of the Roman Empire into the region, [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes had occupied the [[Armorica]]n peninsula, dividing it into five regions that then formed the basis for the Roman administration of the area, and which survived into the period of the Duchy.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=2}} These Gallic tribes \u2013 termed the ''Armorici'' in Latin \u2013 had close relationships with the [[Britons (historical)|Britonnes]] tribes in Roman Britain.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=130}} Between the late 4th and the early 7th centuries, many of these Britonnes migrated to the Armorican peninsula, blending with the local people to form the later Britons,{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=128}} who eventually became the [[Bretons]]. The reasons for these migrations remain uncertain.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=128-131}}{{efn|Mid-20th-century historians Ferdinand Lot and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that this had occurred in response to hostile raids into Britain. But late 20th-century historians, including Patrick Galliou and Michael Jones, have emphasised the paucity of evidence supporting this analysis.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=130-131}}}} These migrations from Britain contributed to Brittany's name. {{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=2-3}}\n\nBrittany fragmented into small, warring ''regna'', kingdoms, each competing for resources.{{sfn|Smith|1992|pp=20-21}} The Frankish [[Carolingian Empire]] conquered the region during the 8th century, starting around 748 taking the whole of Brittany by 799.{{sfn|Price|1989|p=21}} The Carolingians tried to create a unitary administration around the centres of [[Rennes]], [[Nantes]], and [[Vannes]] using the local rulers, but the kings of Brittany's hold on the region remained tenuous.{{sfn|Smith|1992|pp=9, 18}}{{sfn|Everard|2000|p=9}}{{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=57}} Carolingian technology and culture began to influence Brittany, and the church in Brittany also began to emulate the Frankish model. {{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=130}}\n\nThe greatest influence on the later Duchy, however, was the formation of a unitary Brittany kingdom in the 9th century.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=3}} In 831 [[Louis the Pious]] appointed [[Nominoe]], the Count of Vannes,  ruler of the Bretons, imperial [[Missus dominicus|''missus'']], at [[Ingelheim]] in 831. {{sfn|Delumeau|p=524}} After the death of Louis in 840, Nominoe rose to challenge the new emperor, [[Charles the Bald]], emboldened in part by new [[Viking]] raids on the empire.{{sfn|Price|1989|p=23}} Charles the Bald created the [[Marches of Neustria]] to defend [[Western Francia]] from the Bretons and the Vikings.{{sfn|The Columbia Encyclopedia|p= 1252}} Erispoe fought Charles the Bald, who felt that a quick attack would successfully challenge the new Breton leader. [[Erispoe]] won a victory at the [[Battle of Jengland]] and, under their Treaty of Angers in 851, Brittany's independence was secured.\n\n{{Campaignbox Franco-Breton wars}}\nThe new kingdom proved fragile and collapsed under Viking attack.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=3}} In 853 the Viking Godfried left the Seine with his fleet, sailed around the Breton peninsula and sacked Nantes. Erispoe entered into an alliance with the leader of another Viking fleet, Sidroc, who betrayed him, resulting in Erispoe's defeat at the hands of the Vikings.{{sfn|Price|1989|pp=25-26}} A weakened Erispoe ruled until 857 when he was assassinated and then followed as Breton ruler by his cousin and rival, [[Salomon, King of Brittany|Salomon]], the [[Count of Rennes]] and [[Count of Nantes|Nantes]].{{sfn|Bradbury|2007|p=57}} Viking raids continued. [[Alan I, King of Brittany|Alan I]] successfully defeated one wave of Vikings around 900, expanding the kingdom to include not only the Breton territories of [[L\u00e9on (viscounty)|L\u00e9on]], [[Domnon\u00e9e]], [[Cornouaille]], and the Vannetais, but also the [[Franks|Frankish]] counties of Rennes, [[County of Nantes|Nantes]], [[Coutances]], and [[Avranches]], as well as the western parts of [[Poitou]] and [[Anjou]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Alan I's military success resulted in a period of peace from Viking invasions and few raids from the Vikings were recorded from 900 through to 907.{{sfn|Price|1989|p=355}}\n\nAfter Alan I's death in 907, Brittany was overrun once again by Vikings. [[Fulk the Red]], Count of Anjou, is said to have occupied Nantes from 907 to 919 when he abandoned it to the invading Vikings. In 919, the great Viking fleet of Rognvaldr landed in Nantes, quickly coming to dominate the region. This invasion accelerated the exodus of Bretons, including that of the ''[[machtiern]]s'', \"the local hereditary officers upon whom the civil administration depended\".{{sfn|Price|1989|pp=356-360}} Among the refugees were [[Mathuedo\u00ef I, Count of Poher|Mathedoi, the Count of Poher]], and his son [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany|Alan Barbetorte]], the grandson of Alan I; they fled to England and lived in exile in the courts of [[Edward the Elder]] and Edward's son and successor [[\u00c6thelstan]]. The Viking occupation of Brittany lasted until about 936.{{sfn|Price|1989|Appendix Two}} Little recorded history of this period is available until Alan Barbetorte returned in 937 to expel the Vikings and reestablish a version of the former Carolingian kingdom.{{sfn|Price|1989|p=362}}{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main| History of Brittany}}\n\n===10th century===\nThe Duchy of Brittany emerged after Alan Barbetorte's return to the region from England in 936.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=168-169}} Barbetorte claimed the titles of the Count of Cornoualle and Nantes and, as Alan II, reigned as the new ''Brittonum dux''.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=169}} Using a network of small, defended towns and monastic sites, Alan pushed back the Viking advances.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=15}} On 1 August 939, with the aid of [[Judicael Berengar]], Count of Rennes, and [[Hugh I, Count of Maine]], he defeated the Vikings in the [[Battle of Trans-la-For\u00eat]], completing their expulsion from Brittany.{{sfn|Hjardar|Vike|2016|p=334}} Alan's duchy was smaller than the previous Kingdom of Brittany, as, despite gaining [[Magues]] and [[Tiffauges]] in the south, the dukes no longer ruled over the regions of [[Cotentin]], [[Avranchin]], and [[Mayenne]].{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=169}} Alan paid homage to [[Louis IV of France]] for Brittany in 942.{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=4}} Despite some older Celtic influences, the new duchy was in many ways similar to the other, post-Carolingian states forming across the region.{{sfn|Jones|1988|pp=2-3}} Over the coming decades, a network of powerful local lords emerged across Brittany, occupying [[motte and bailey]] castles and owing a loose [[feudal]] loyalty to the duke.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=169-170}} The east of Brittany was the first to change, but the practices spread over the next fifty years to the more remote regions of the north- and south-west.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=170-171}}\n\nAlan II was also allied to [[Theobald I of Blois]], the [[Count of Blois|count of Chartres]].{{sfn|Jones|1988|p=4}} Alan II had married Theobald's sister, Adelaide, giving Theobald influence all the way to Rennes.{{sfn|Bachrach|page=7}} However Alan II's death left a void in Brittany leaving it vulnerable to encroachment by either the Normans or the Angevins.{{sfn|Bachrach|page=8}} In turn the recently widowed [[Fulk II, Count of Anjou]], Theobald's ally, married Alan II's widow.{{efn|Brittany was free of any royal French influence until 1123, when [[Louis VI of France]] confirmed the bishop of Nantes. See Jones, 1988, page 4.}} Upon his death, Alan II was succeeded by his son [[Drogo, Duke of Brittany|Drogo]]. Drogo's rule set the precedent for the role of a regent during the minority of a ducal heir. Throughout his reign, Drogo was under the shared regency of his uncle the Count of Blois, Theobald I (who entrusted the administration of the duchy to Wicohen, Archbishop of [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]], and the Count of Rennes [[Juhel Berengar]] as administrators), and his stepfather, the Fulk II, Count of Anjou.{{sfn|Bachrach| page=261}}\n\nUnder Drogo, the duchy continued to experience political instability and he was unable to sustain his line. Drogo died in 958. Two of Alan II's illegitimate sons, [[Ho\u00ebl I, Duke of Brittany|Ho\u00ebl]] and Guerich, attempted to act as Counts of Nantes and preserve their claim to duchy but were eventually unsuccessful. In 990 Juhel Berengar's son [[Conan I of Rennes|Conan I]], the grandson of Pascweten, became Duke and the title passed to the House of [[Rennes]]. Conan I ruled for only two years and died fighting against his brother-in-law [[Fulk III, Count of Anjou]] at the [[Battle of Conquereuil]] on 27 June 992. He was succeeded by his oldest son [[Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey I]]. Blois threatened Conan's succession. Duke Geoffrey I, a member of the House of Nantes, entered into a dynastic alliance with [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]] in a diplomatic double marriage between the two houses. The church-sanctioned marriage ceremonies were held at [[Mont Saint-Michel]].

Odo was Ho\u00e8l's brother-in-law as he was married to Hoel's sister Agnes of Cornouaille. By 1057, Conan II captured and imprisoned Odo.

William continued courting the family of Odo, who was imprisoned. In response, Conan promoted his own legitimate claim as Duke of Normandy over William, as the Catholic Church began preferring legitimate heirs born in church-sanctioned marriage over out-of-wedlock issue.{{sfn|Patterson|2004}} This rivalry led to war between Normandy and Brittany. \n{{Campaignox Breton-Norman War}}\n[[File:BayeuxTapestryScene20.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The attack on [[Dinan]], from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\nThe 1064\u20131065 war between Brittany and Normandy (the Breton-Norman War) was sparked after Duke William supported the rebellion against Conan II led by [[Rivallon I of Dol]].<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> In 1065, before his invasion of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], William of Normandy warned his rivals in Brittany and Anjou to abstain from any attacks on his duchy, on the grounds that his mission bore the papal banner.{{sfn|Howarth|2008}} However, Conan II rebuffed the warning and declared that he would press any advantage against William.{{sfn|Patterson|2004}} While William plotted to take the English crown, Conan consolidated his authority in Brittany and planned to take advantage of William's absence to invade Normandy.{{sfn|Patterson|2004}} First, however, he needed to neutralize Anjou, another historic rival.

The Bretons within the Conquest army represented at least three major groupings,{{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=3}} two of which would become relevant to the long-term future of the duchy. One group was represented by [[Ralph de Gael]], briefly the Earl of Suffolk. In 1075 he was among the leaders of a \"Breton revolt\".{{sfn|Keats-Rohan 1991|page=3}} Ralph escaped returning to Brittany where he also revolted against the Breton Duke before eventually reconciling with the duchy.

Hawise was married to count [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]]. In 1098, Alan IV joined the [[First Crusade]], leaving Brittany under the regency of his wife Ermengarde of Anjou until his return early in the 12th century. Ermengarde ruled from Nantes rather than Rennes, as it was closer to her home county of Anjou.\n\n===12th century===\n[[File:Conan IV de Bretagne.jpg|thumb|Seal of [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany]]]]\nAlan IV returned from Crusade in 1101. In 1112, Alan IV's son Conan III inherited Brittany on the abdication of his father, who retired to the [[Redon Abbey|monastery of Redon]]. By 1113, Conan III married Maude, an illegitimate daughter of King [[Henry I of England]]. With Maude he had three children, [[Hoel, Count of Nantes|Hoel]], [[Bertha, Duchess of Brittany|Bertha]], and Constance. During his reign he strengthened the rule of the duchy.\n\nDuring the [[The Anarchy|dynastic struggle]] between [[Stephen of England]] (Stephen of Blois) and the dispossessed [[Empress Matilda]], Conan III allied himself with King Stephen. Empress Matilda's unpopular marriage with [[Geoffrey V of Anjou]] was forced upon her by her father Henry I. It reflected the historic rivalry between Brittany, Normandy, and Anjou.\n\nConan III sought to counter [[Angevin Empire|Angevin influence]] and preserve Breton independence. In his alliance with Stephen, Conan III looked for greater influence with Stephen, who needed allies on the continent to out-flank Matilda. Matilda was able to consolidate power in Normandy and Anjou. Brittany's position to the west of the Angevin controlled territory exposed a wide frontier for Stephen to exploit against Matilda.\n\nIn 1138, Conan III's daughter, Bertha, was married to [[Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond|Alan of Penthi\u00e8vre]], a supporter of King Stephen. For his support, Stephan created Conan's son-in-law Alan as 1st [[Earl of Richmond]] in the second creation, a title previously held by Alan's uncle Alain Le Roux. Later, when Alan died in 1146, Bertha returned home to Brittany from England. On his death-bed in 1148, Conan III disinherited his son Hoel, Count of Nantes from succession to the duchy.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> With this surprise move, Bertha became his heiress and successor as hereditary Duchess of Brittany.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> However, Hoel was to retain the county of Nantes.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>\n\nDuchess Bertha, as [[dowager]] countess of Richmond, continued Brittany's alliance with Stephen's England against the Angevins. However this strategy became untenable after 1153, when Stephen's son Eustace died suddenly. Eustace's death provided an opportunity for Matilda's son, [[Henry II of England|Henry FitzEmpress]], to land an invasion army in England and press for his mother's claims. In the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], Stephen was forced to recognize Henry FitzEmpress as his heir, with Matilda abdicating her claim in her son's favour. The treaty exposed Brittany to retaliatory incursions from Henry FitzEmpress and his brother [[Geoffrey VI, Count of Anjou|Geoffery FitzEmpress]].\n\nOn the death of Bertha in early 1156, her son, [[Conan IV, Duke of Brittany|Conan IV]], expected to inherit the ducal throne.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> However, he was denied his inheritance by his stepfather Odo, [[Porho\u00ebt|Viscount of Porho\u00ebt]] (also known as Odo II), Bertha's second husband; Odo II refused to relinquish his authority over Brittany.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> To consolidate his hold on power, Odo II entered into a pact with the disinherited Hoel, Count of Nantes, to divide Brittany between them. But at the same time, Hoel was under threat of rebellion in Nantes, sponsored by Geoffrey Fitzempress, and he could not send any aid to Eudas. Conan IV landed in Brittany and took Rennes, while his ally Raoul de Foug\u00e8res captured and imprisoned Eudas.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> Conan IV was formally enthroned as Duke of Brittany in Rennes. While Conan IV was consolidating his inheritance in 1156, Geoffrey FitzEmpress successfully took Nantes from Hoel.\n\nUpon Geoffrey's death in 1158, Conan IV seized Nantes, reuniting the Duchy once again. However, Henry II, now King of England, seized the Earldom of Richmond, Conan's paternal inheritance. Henry demanded the return of Nantes, and when he obtained control of it from Conan IV, became the Count of Nantes, without obligation to the Duke of Brittany (later dukes would eventually reunite Nantes to Brittany).\n\nHenry II of England continued to stoke revolts and rebellions in Brittany against Conan IV. In response, Conan IV took the Breton counties of [[Tr\u00e9guier]] and [[Guingamp]] from his uncle Count Henri, a supporter of Henry II of England.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/> Richmond was returned to Conan IV later that year in an agreement reached with Henry II of England.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>\nBy 1160 Conan was forced to yield to Henry. In the peace negotiations which followed, Conan was obliged to marry Henry's cousin, [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Duchess of Brittany|Margaret of Scotland]], in 1160.<ref name=\"BrittanyGeneology\"/>\n\nLater, Conan IV was faced with additional revolts from barons, possibly sponsored by Henry II. Conan appealed to Henry II for aid to end the revolts. For his aid Henry II insisted on the betrothal of Conan's only daughter and heiress [[Constance, Duchess of Brittany|Constance]] to Henry's son [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey Plantagenet]], continuing the policy of interweaving the Breton succession with the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]]'s succession. \n[[File:Territorial Conquests of Philip II of France.png|thumb|France's influence grows under Philip II]]\nUpon her father's abdication in 1166, Constance became duchess, although Henry II held the Duchy until Constance married Geoffrey. Geoffrey and Constance ruled jointly until 1186, when Geoffrey was [[List of horse accidents|stamped to death]] in a riding accident during a [[tournament]] in Paris. Constance thereafter ruled the Duchy on her own. Henry II of England next arranged for Constance to marry [[Ranulph de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester]] on 3 February 1188 or 1189. Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by Richard I as King of England. Lacking a male heir, King [[Richard I of England]] officially proclaimed his nephew, Constance's son, [[Arthur I of Brittany]], as his heir presumptive in a treaty signed with [[Philip Augustus]] and [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Sicily]].\n\nTo promote her son's position and inheritance, Constance, Duchess of Brittany included Arthur in the government of Brittany in 1196. The same year, Constance's marriage with Ranulph deteriorated, with Ranulph imprisoning Constance. Her imprisonment sparked rebellion across Brittany on her behalf. Ranulph bowed to growing pressure and had the Duchess released in 1198. Once back in Brittany, Constance had her marriage to Ranulph annulled in 1199 (there was no issue from this marriage). Later that year, Constance took [[Guy, Duke of Brittany|Guy of Thouars]] as her 'second' husband at [[Angers]]. Throughout these years, Constance advised her son Arthur towards a French alliance, pursuing the policy of her late husband Geoffrey II, despite his designation as Richard I's heir. In Constance bore Guy of Thouars two or three daughters.{{efn|The existence of Constance and Guy's third daughter is still disputed. See [http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BRITTANY.htm#MargueriteChesterMGeoffroyIRohan  ''Medieval Lands'']}} The first born, [[Alix, Duchess of Brittany|Alix of Thouars]], was followed by [[Catherine of Thouars]] (1201-c. 1240) and maybe Margaret of Thouars (1201-c. 1216/1220). Constance died due to complications during the delivery.\n\n===13th century===\n[[File:Peter I of Brittany2.jpg|thumb|[[Peter of Dreux|Pierre Mauclerc]]: Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris'' with [[Alix, Duchess of Brittany|Alix]], and Regent to his son [[John I, Duke of Brittany|John I]]]]\nIn the 13th century England's alliance with Brittany collapsed under King [[John of England]]. When Richard I died in 1199, Philip agreed to recognize [[Arthur of Brittany]] as count of Anjou, Maine, and Poitou, in exchange for Arthur swearing fealty to him, and thereby becoming a direct vassal of France. However, in 1202, 15-year-old Arthur was captured by the English while besieging [[Mirebeau]]. By 1203, the imprisoned Arthur was transferred to [[Rouen]], under the charge of [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]], the court favorite of King John. Arthur vanished mysteriously in April 1203. Arthur's legal successor was [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor of Brittany]]. However John of England had Eleanor captured and imprisoned at [[Corfe Castle]] in [[Dorset]].\n\nRecognizing that John of England could have Eleanor married to a vassal loyal to England, who would rule Brittany through her, Philip II  formally recognized Constance's infant daughter Alix as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. Initially Alix's father Guy of Thouars acted as regent. Philip II of France was maneuvering to keep Brittany within his sphere of influence. The marriage of the infant Alix to Capetian cadet [[Peter of Dreux|Pierre Mauclerc]] in 1213, began the new [[House of Dreux]]. After Guy of Thouars' regency, Alix ruled as nominal duchess with her husband [[Peter I, Duke of Brittany|Pierre]] as Duke ''jure uxoris''. In 1214, King John sent an expedition into France, in part to establish Eleanor as his puppet duchess, but after his defeat also recognized Alix and Peter as rulers of the Duchy. Eleanor was kept captive in England until her death in 1241, ending the line of Geoffrey II.\n\nIn 1235, the stage was set for the next century's [[Breton War of Succession]] when [[Peter I, Duke of Brittany|Peter I]] dispossessed the heir of the Penthi\u00e8vre Dynasty in order to give the countship of Penthi\u00e8vre to his second child, [[Yolande of Brittany|Yolande]].\n\nBeginning in the 13th century, the Duchy of Brittany experienced nearly a century of peace. Peter I continued as Regent for a time for his son [[John I, Duke of Brittany|John I]]. When John I reached his majority, Peter I ceded him the Ducal crown and left Brittany on Crusade.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} John I married [[Blanche of Navarre, Duchess of Brittany|Blanche of Navarre]]. Upon the death of his sister Yolande of Brittany, John I seized the countship of Penthi\u00e8vre for himself. John I in turn was succeeded by his son [[John II, Duke of Brittany|John II]]. John II married [[Beatrice of England]] and ruled until 1305.\n\n===14th century===\n[[File:Battle of Auray.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Auray in 1364 resulting in victory for the House of Montfort in the Breton War of Succession]]\n{{Campaignbox Breton War of Succession}}\nIn the 14th century, the Breton War of Succession ensued; the title of Duke passed to the House of Montfort. John II died in 1305 and was succeeded by this son, [[Arthur II, Duke of Brittany|Arthur II]] as Duke. Arthur II's ruled independently of the French crown. His reign included several administrative innovations including the creation of several \"battles\" or districts meant to provide a stronger defense, and the creation of the [[Estates of Brittany]], marking a critical step towards a parliamentary form of government. Arthur II's reign is also distinguished by his two marriages, the first to Mary of Limoges and the second to [[Yolande of Dreux, Queen of Scotland]].\n\nArthur II's son by Mary of Limoges, [[John III, Duke of Brittany|John III]] became Duke but failed to produce a living heir, despite three marriages. John III's succession efforts were focused on his attempts to deny his half brother, [[John of Montfort]] from inheriting the Ducal Crown. He attempted to name the King of France as heir in an act that defied all precedents to maintain Brittany as an independent sovereign state. The Breton nobles predictably rejected the attempt and Brittany's independence continued. John III died in 1341 without a succession plan.\n\nJohn III's half-brother, John of Montfort, claimed the title of Duke, but his claim was rejected by the King of France who favored the competing claims of [[Joanna of Dreux|Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre]]{{efn| Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre was John of Montfort's half-niece by his half brother, Guy. John III, Guy and John of Montfort were all sons of Arthur II.}} and her husband [[Charles of Blois]], who also claimed the Ducal title.  The Breton War of Succession between the claimants ensued when John of Montfort refused to cede his rights in their favor. The Breton War of Succession was fought from 1341 to 1364 between these two Breton houses, the [[House of Blois|House of Blois Ch\u00e2tillon]] and the [[Montfort of Brittany|House of Montfort]].\n\n[[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois Ch\u00e2tillon]] claimed the title Duke of Brittany from 1341 to his death.\n\nDuring the war, John of Montfort was imprisoned in Paris. Hostilities abated for a short time, and he was freed under the Treaty of Malestroit in 1341. He died in 1345, leaving his son John as the Montfort claimant to the ducal title. John's widowed Duchess Consort, [[Joanna of Flanders]], acted as regent for her son John and continued the war in his name. The House of Montfort emerged victorious with substantial help from English allies{{efn| At the beginning of the conflict when John de Montfort was nearly routed by Charles of Blois, John's wife [[Joanna of Flanders]] was able to successfully defend Brest and turn the tide of the war with the assistance of the English naval forces led by [[Walter de Manny, 1st Baron Manny]]. When Jean de Montfort's son launched his attack on the forces of Charles de Blois, his British allies were led by [[John Chandos]]. Years after the Breton Civil War, John IV returned from exile in England a second time with British allies led by [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas Woodstock]].}} Under the terms of their surrender,  Joan was allowed to keep Penthi\u00e8vre and retained the title Duchess of Brittany for life. Under the Treaties of Guerande, [[Salic law|semi-Salic]] succession was agreed under which, if the reigning member of the House of Montfort died without legitimate male issue, the eldest direct legitimate male descendant of Joan would inherit the Ducal crown of Brittany. [[John IV, Duke of Brittany]] ruled with difficulty after the Breton civil war, and was forced into exile in England for a second time in 1373 where he lived in the court of [[Edward III, King of England|Edward III]].\n\nThe House of Montfort's victory strengthened the position of England in [[Brittany]]. One of the effects of the Breton War of Succession was to intensify the rivalries between England and France with Brittany as the contested prize. The Houses of Penthi\u00e8vre and Montfort were united in the sense of their opposition to the attempted annexation of Brittany by [[Charles V of France]] as a consequence of this Breton civil war. The French king sent the [[Constable of France]], [[Bertrand de Guesclin]], into Brittany with the goal of uniting it to the French crown. When the Breton nobles rebelled against this proposed unification, John IV was able to return from England, assisted once again by a strong army including his English ally, and was able to re-establish his rule.{{efn|John IV relied on two English military leaders to execute his two military campaigns to regain the Duchy, John Chandos and Thomas Woodstock.}} The deposed Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre joined in the efforts to return John IV to Brittany to defend the Duchy against the advances of Charles V. John IV had three wives but only his third wife, Joan of Navarre, bore him children. John IV died on 1 November 1399. Joan remained a widow for four years acting as a regent for her son John V.{{efn|According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', affection developed between Joanna and Henry Bolingbroke (the future King Henry IV) while he resided at the Breton court during his banishment from England. In 1403, Joan became the second wife of [[Henry IV, King of England]].}} The House of Montfort's difficulties in maintaining the Ducal crown continued when [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] succeeded his father. By 1417, the Duke of Brittany were styled \"rulers by the Grace of God\".{{sfn|Small|2009|p=18}}\n\n===15th century===\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|[[Hundred Years' War]] evolution. {{Legend|#FFFF80|French}}{{Legend|#B2B2B2|English}}\n{{Legend|#868686|Burgundian}}\nEngland and France competed for influence over the Duchy of Brittany during the war.]]\nThe intrigues and contests between the House of Montfort and the House of Penthi\u00e8vre continued well after the Breton War of Succession. John IV's successor, John V, Duke of Brittany, was kidnapped by the son of [[Joan, Duchess of Brittany|Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre]]. He was freed through the efforts of his wife the Duchess of Brittany, [[Joan of France, Duchess of Brittany|Joan of France]] and the remaining wealth of the Penthi\u00e8vre family was confiscated. John V was succeeded first by his son [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany|Francis I]]. Since Francis I had no male heir, he was followed by a younger son of John V, [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany|Peter II]]. When Peter II died without issue, the Ducal Crown passed to his uncle [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Arthur III]]. He was, in turn, succeeded by his nephew [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany|Francis II]].\n\nThe reign of Francis II was notable in many respects including two wars against [[Charles VIII of France]], both of which were lost, the establishment of the [[Parlement of Brittany]], and the death of all of his children save for his daughter [[Anne of Brittany]]. Francis II's rule as Duke was also marked by continued intrigues with the House of Penthi\u00e8vre. Joan of Penthi\u00e8vre's later descendants, the Brosse line of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre through [[Jean de Brosse]], were denied their claims to the Ducal Crown in the 15th century, possibly as an alteration of the rules of inheritance by the then Duke of Brittany Francis II. The wars with France eventually cost Ducal Brittany its independence, while the Parlement ensured a degree of autonomy that would continue through the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]]. That Francis II's sole heir was his daughter Anne assured an inheritance contest on his death that would pit the power of the House of Montfort against conflicting treaty obligations to the House of Penthi\u00e8vre in Brittany, and the House of Valois in France, and would also be a test of the Breton tradition of semi-Salic law in which a daughter could be the principal inheritor. The position of the King of France dominated these events through two wars. After the first war, under the [[Treaty of Verger]], the marriage of Francis II's sole surviving issue, Anne, would need to be approved by the King of France.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nFrancis II worked to seek a husband for Anne who would be strong enough to defend Brittany from further influence from the French Crown. Duchesse Anne of Brittany was initially betrothed to [[Edward V of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]], the son of [[Edward IV of England]], but upon the king's death his son disappeared and the English throne passed to [[Richard III of England]]. Anne was then married to [[Maximillian I of Austria]].\n\nHowever, relations between Brittany and France deteriorated and Francis II was forced into the last Franco-Breton war, which he lost. At the end of the second war between Francis II and Charles VIII of France, the so-called [[Mad War]], Anne of Brittany's first marriage to Maximillian was declared illegal on the basis that the French King had not approved it under the terms of the Treaty of Verger. Anne was married to Charles VIII of France in a ceremony that was validated by [[Pope Innocent III]]. Once they were married, Charles did not allow Anne to use the title Duchess of Brittany. However, upon his death, Anne returned to Brittany and took steps to return the Duchy to independent rule under herself as Duchess. The children of Charles and Anne did not reach adulthood and this presented a new Breton succession problem as well as one for France. Both succession issues were solved upon Anne's marriage to [[Louis XII of France]] but at the cost of restoring and furthering the independence of Brittany.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 1499, the birth of Anne of Brittany's sole heir with Louis XII of France, her daughter [[Claude of France]], introduced a new succession issue in Brittany and France. In Brittany, with the provisions of the Treaty of Guerande set aside by the Estates of Brittany, Claude could claim to be Duchess of Brittany in her own right, as several Duchesses by right of inheritance had done over the centuries. France, however operated under strict Salic law, requiring a male heir. The French requirement was solved upon Claude's marriage to [[Francis I of France]]. The birth of Claude's sons Francis (who became [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]], as well as the Dauphin of France) and [[Henry II of France]] represented a resolution to these contrasting succession issues but accelerated the loss of Brittany's independence and the eventual disappearance of the Ducal title as an independent sovereign Ducal crown.\n\n===16th century===\n[[File:Portrait of unknown, formerly known as Claude de France (Corneille de Lyon, 1535-1540, Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|[[Claude of France|Claude, Duchess of Brittany]]]]\nAnne of Brittany's second marriage making her Queen Consort of France continued into the 16th century; and she died in 1514. Queen Claude of France, reigned as duchess of Brittany from 1514, but under her husband king Francis was not able to maintain an independent government in the Duchy of Brittany. Claude's son Francis I was invested as duke of Brittany. But this act meant next to nothing to advance Breton independence. Some members of the [[Counts and dukes of Penthi\u00e8vre|House of Penthi\u00e8vre]] were appointed as royal governors of Brittany by the French. Their failure to reassert their Ducal rights successfully hastened the merger of the Ducal crown into the Kingdom of France. At this time the title Duke of Brittany began to lose independent sovereign status and began to become only titular in character; the Breton region lost independence and became a province of France.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Kings of France considered that the Duchy of Brittany was feudally a part of their Kingdom of France (i.e. it was within the traditional borders of the realm, and the King of France was deemed to be overlord of the Duchy). In practice, however, the Duchy of Brittany was a largely independent sovereign state.\n\nThe independent sovereign nature of the Duchy began to come to an end upon the death of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. The Duchy was inherited by his daughter, Anne, but King Charles VIII of France, determined to bring the territory under royal control, had her marriage annulled and then forced her to marry him in a series of actions that were acknowledged by the Pope. As a result, the Kingdom of France and the Duchy of Brittany were placed in the personal union of their marriage, and the King of France also held the title of Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris''. During their marriage, the Charles VIII prohibited Anne of Brittany from using the title Duchess of Brittany, and imposed a Royal Governor from the House of Penthi\u00e8vre on the Duchy.\n\nLegally, however, the Duchy remained separate from France proper; the two titles were linked only by the marriage of the King and Queen and, in 1498 when Charles VIII died childless, the title ''Duke of Brittany'' remained with Anne, rather than passing to the heir of France, Louis XII. Anne of Brittany returned to Brittany and began to re-establish an independent sovereign rule. However, the new French king, Louis XII married Anne himself, and so the King of France was once more Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris''. Legally, Brittany still remained distinct, and its future remained dependent on the Ducal bloodline, now held by the House of Montfort. When Anne died, Brittany passed to her daughter and heiress, Claude, rather than remaining with the King of France, her father.\n[[File:Franciszek III Breto\u0144ski.JPG|thumb|left|[[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]]]]\nClaude married the future King of France, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. By this marriage, and through the succession to the French crown, the King of France became Duke of Brittany ''jure uxoris'' once more.\nClaude's death in 1524 separated the Duchy from the crown again, and (it would transpire) for the final time. Because Claude, like her mother, was sovereign Duchess, the title of 'Duke' did not remain with her husband, but instead passed to her son, [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany|Francis III of Brittany]], who was also [[Dauphin of France]]. Legally, the Crown and Duchy were again separate, but the Duke was a child, and the Duchy had been governed as an integral part of France for years; the King had little trouble in maintaining royal control over the Duchy. Breton independence was effectively ended when in 1532 the Estates of Brittany proclaimed the perpetual union of Brittany with the French crown. Legally, the Duchy was part of France.\n\nFrancis III remained Duke of Brittany, but died without attaining the French crown in 1536. He was succeeded by his brother Henry, who was the first person to become both King of France and Duke of Brittany in his own right. Any trace of Breton independence ended with the ascension of Henry, as Henry II of France, to the French throne. The French Crown and Breton Duchy were now united by inheritance, and the merging of Brittany into France was thus completed. Henry II was not crowned separately as Duke of Brittany. However Henry attempted to create a separate legal status for Brittany vis-a-vis the Kingdom of France similar to the position of the Duchy of Cornwall to the Kingdom of Great Britain.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In some histories it is meant to be a ducal territory he would attempt to preserve for himself and his heirs if he was to lose the French Crown. This attempt at legal separation did not survive his reign.\n\nWhen [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (last direct male from Claude of France) died, Brittany passed as part of the Crown to the next heir of France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], rather than to Claude's most senior heirs (either [[Henry II, Duke of Lorraine]] or Infanta [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]]). While these nobles were technically Henry's heirs, there were problems with both claimants to the Ducal crown. The most important issue was that the crown, as a Sovereign Duke, could not be separated from that of the French Crown. Meanwhile, the French Crown and the Spanish Crown had been permanently separated beginning with the reign of Philip of Spain.\n\nIn 1582, Henry III of France, last living male-line grandson of [[Claude, Duchess of Brittany]], made [[Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc\u0153ur]], his brother-in-law and a leader of [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], [[governor of Brittany]]. Invoking the hereditary rights of his wife Marie de Luxembourg, he endeavoured to make himself independent in that province from 1589 onward, and organized a government at Nantes, proclaiming their young son [[Philippe Louis de Lorraine-Merc\u0153ur]] \"prince and duke of Brittany\". (Infanta Isabella was the eldest daughter of the eldest sister of Henry III but being female weakened her status, and her position as Infanta all but blocked inheritance to the Breton Duchy.) Through maternal ancestry he was the direct [[Primogeniture|primogenitural heir]] of Duchess Joan, of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre, wife of [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]]. Merc\u0153ur organized a government at Nantes, supported by the Spaniards. He prevented Henry IV's attempts to subjugate Brittany until 20 March 1598, when Merc\u0153ur was forced to surrender. Henry IV then had one of his own illegitimate sons marry the young daughter of the Merc\u0153urs, and thereby assured direct French control of the province. Merc\u0153ur subsequently went in exile to [[History of Hungary#Decline (1490\u20131526)|Hungary]].\n\nThe title ''Duke of Brittany'' largely ceased to be used as a title of the King of France. When it appeared the title was bestowed by the King of France to one of his direct descendants, and was in any event titular in status.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\n[[File:Louis de bourbon (1707-1712).jpg|thumb|[[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Brittany|Louis, the last Duke of Brittany]]]]\nUnder the Kings of France the nobles of Brittany continued to enjoy the privileges that had been accorded them by the various independent Dukes of Brittany. Brittany's Celtic legal traditions were maintained, to a degree, and the Estates of Brittany and the Parlement of Brittany were kept separate from the French parliamentary system in Paris. The Breton noble privileges protected in this parliamentary system included exemption from taxes, representation in the Breton Parlement, and the maintenance of Breton titles in the tradition of the Duchy rather than that of France, including, in theory, the application of Brittany's form of semi-Salic, rather than pure Salic Law to the succession issues.\n\nAfter [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], the title Duke of Brittany was not used for over 200 years. The title Duke of Brittany reappeared when a great-grandson of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was named [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Brittany|Louis, Duke of Brittany]]; He was the last holder of the title prior to the French Revolution and did not live to inherit the French throne. At his death the title in essence became defunct.\n\nClaims on the titular Ducal title by Spanish nobles at various times were not to be considered legitimate by the French, and its use by Louis XIV demonstrated that as the title had merged into the crown of France only the King could assert the title himself or bestow it on another. Louis XIV's actions with regard to the Ducal title also underscored the fact that the Spanish or cadet branch of the House of Bourbon had relinquished all French claims and inheritance rights as a condition of gaining the crown of Spain under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].\n\nShortly before the French Revolution the leaders of the Parlement of Brittany issued Remonstrances to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], in part to remind the King of his duties as Duke and to preserve the privileges of the Breton people under the Treaty of Union. The King's response was to close the Breton Parlement. The [[Remontrances]] were delivered to the King by Members of the Breton Parlement led by the Comte de Saisy de Kerampuil, and others.\n\nWhen French King Louis XVI dissolved the Breton Parlement he did so to strengthen his claims as an absolute monarch (where a representative parliament was not necessary). He also did this to advance a centralized federal form of government, but in so doing preserved the nature of the Brittany's autonomy by acknowledging its nobles' traditional privileges, and acted as the Duke of Brittany.\n\nThe Breton Parlement has not met since this event. During the French Revolution, the legal state of Brittany was dissolved by the French National Assembly. The province of Brittany was divided  and replaced by the 5 departements that have continued in the modern French Republic.\n\n==Society, culture and governance==\n\n===Economy===\nThe north and western parts of the territory relied on a pastoral farming economy; the south-east enjoyed warmer weather and conducted mixed-arable and pastoral farming, based around small holdings.{{sfn|Smith|1992|pp=25-26}} The region enjoyed a strong and diverse maritime economy including active ports of trade and fishing. Over the time of the Duchy, many currencies were present, and the Dukes of Brittany sometimes minted their own coins. Gold and silver were also used for trade.\n\n===Folklore and Legends===\n[[File:Tristan Iseult fountain Louvre OA10958.jpg|thumb|14th-century depiction of the Breton romance ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'']]\nIn the 12th century, legends of [[Conan Meriadoc]] became popular in North-West Europe. By the 18th century these accounts had been described as mythical.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=131}}\n\nA reference is made by the [[chronicler]] [[Jordanes]] to a commander named [[Riothamus]] \u2013 the Celtic for \"supreme leader\" \u2013 fighting in the region on behalf of the Roman emperor around 470 but little other evidence exists for this period.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=131-132}}\n\nThe chroniclers of Viking raids in Brittany and Normandy recounted that [[Olaf II of Norway|St Olaf]] raided the northern coast of Brittany in the area of the town of [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]].{{sfn|Price|1989|p=14}}\n\n===Role of the Catholic Church===\n[[File:Dol-de-Bretagne - Nef de la cathedrale 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of Dol Cathedral, Seat of the Ancient Archbishopric of Dol, dedicated to St Samson]]\nThe Duchy was influenced by the growth of the major monastic orders in the wake of the [[Gregorian reforms]] of the 11th century.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=267-268}} Backed by the Breton aristocracy, new churches and priories were built and the Church administration became more active.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=268}} In the 13th century, the new mendicant orders spread across the towns of the Duchy, again with support of the lords who controlled the urban centres.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=268-269}} These mendicant orders were popular, and became more so in the 15th century.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=270}} Relics of local saints remained popular, but relics associated with central Catholic figures such as the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[John the Apostle]] became increasingly popular in the 13th and 14th centuries.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=270-272}}\n\n===Customs and laws===\nThe Duchy that formed in the 10th and the 11th centuries was a feudal society, with laws and customs run through a hierarchy of Breton lords, from the numerous holders of local castles through to the handful of counts and the Duke in the urban centres.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=170-169}} This reliance on the mass of local lords was a break with the former Celtic and Carolingian polities in the region.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|pp=171-172}} The aristocracy in Breton were, as historians Galliou and Jones describe, \"conservative and tenancious\" in their outlook, but heavily influenced by French society and culture, which sometimes produced tensions with older, more local traditions and customs.{{sfn|Galliou|Jones|1991|p=172}}\n\n===Rise of parliamentary government===\n[[File:Artur Bretan.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur II, Duke of Brittany|Arthur II]]]]\nThe Estates of Brittany were founded by [[Arthur II, Duke of Brittany|Arthur II]] who was considered completely independent of the Kingdom of France. He convoked the first Estates of Brittany in 1309. In addition to creating a parliamentary body, Arthur II added the innovation of including the [[Estates of the realm|Third Estate]].\n\nThese parliamentary bodies figured prominently in the Breton War of Succession and helped to resolve the Ducal Claims of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre in favor of the House of Montfort. The Estates of Brittany acted during the reign of Francis II, of the House of Montfort, to nullify provisions of the Treaty of Guerande and to confirm that [[Anne, Duchess of Brittany|Anne]] was Francis II's sole and legal Ducal heir. The action in favor of Anne, Duchess of Brittany effectively ended the Ducal claims of the House of Penthi\u00e8vre.\n\nThe Parlement of Brittany was founded in 1485 by Francis II and first met in Vannes. Later the Parlement was moved to Rennes where the Parlement building remains in use to today as a Court of Justice. Initially the Parlement of Brittany functioned as a sovereign court of justice and was designed, among other things, to protect the ancient rights of the Breton nobles. Many of its members were also members of the Estates of Brittany.\n\nAfter the Duchy of Brittany was merged into the Crown of France, the Parlement of Brittany took on greater responsibility to manage and preserve the rights of the Duchy as separate from the Kingdom of France. While Henry II of France  held all rights as Duke of Brittany he was neither frequently present in the Duchy nor entirely inclined to preserve the independent actions of its parliament. As the Kings of France moved to greater centralized authority under Louis XIV of France, Louis XV of France, and Louis XVI of France, tensions between the Kingdom and the Duchy grew.  In September 1771, the Parlement was closed by order of Louis XVI of France; the National Assembly subsequently issued a French law to close the Parlement in 1790. The Parlement of Brittany met and they established that these actions had no force of law based on the Breton laws and traditions on which the Parliament had been founded. Notwithstanding this claim, the Parlement of Brittany has not met since 1790.\n\n===Richmondshire===\nNobles from the Breton Ducal family who fought for William the Conqueror in 1066 were the first Lords of Richmond, and eventually the first in a series of [[Earl of Richmond|Earls of Richmond]] in England. [[Alan Rufus]] was among William's Earls and built [[Richmond Castle]]. Conan III allied himself with [[Stephen of England]] in his war against the dispossessed [[Empress Matilda]]. For his support, Stephen created Conan's son-in-law Alan 1st Earl of Richmond.\n\n[[Arthur III of Brittany]] (August 24, 1393 \u2013 December 26, 1458), was known as Arthur de Richemont, and was the titular Earl of Richmond. For eleven months at the very end of his life, Arthur was both Duke of Brittany and Count of Montfort, after inheriting those titles upon the death of his nephew. After the death of Arthur's father, John V of Brittany, the English refused to recognize his heirs as earls. Nevertheless, the Breton Dukes continued to style themselves \"Count of Richmond\", while the English title was given to [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John of Lancaster]]  (1389\u20131435) in 1414.\n\nFrancis II was host to the Henry Tudor, the future Henry VII of England when he fled England to seek safety from Richard III of England. Brittany's possessions in Richmond passed indisputably to England when [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]], surrendered his rights to Henry, thereby permitting him to take the title Earl of Richmond.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:PanoDonjonDinanM.jpg|thumb|The 14th-century [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dinan]], the ''Keep of the Duchesse Anne'']]\nThere is no modern-day Duchy of Brittany. The Duchy of Brittany and the sovereign title and role of the Duke of Brittany no longer exist in the modern [[Fifth French Republic|5th Republic of France]]. The [[Breton Parlement]] no longer exists. Its seat was in Rennes. It was disbanded by Louis XIV but the Parlement voted to ignore the King's order of dissolution upon the claim it alone had the authority to dissolve this legislative and judicial body. Since 1956, there does exist the administrative [[Brittany (administrative region)|Region of Brittany]] \u2013 which, however, includes only 80 percent of the former Duchy of Brittany. The remaining 20 percent of the former Duchy is the [[Loire-Atlantique]] [[departments of France|department]] which now lies inside the [[Pays de la Loire]] region, whose capital, Nantes, was the historical capital of the Duchy of Brittany.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles de Blois Ch\u00e2tillon]], the Blessed  \n* [[Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne]] (Castle of the Dukes of Brittany) in Nantes \n* [[Dukes of Brittany family tree]]\n* [[List of religious figures of Brittany]]\n* [[List of rulers of Brittany]]\n* [[List of consorts of Brittany]]\n* [[Union between Brittany and France]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = [[Bernard Bachrach|Bachrach]]\n  | first = Bernard S. \n  | year = 1993 \n  | title = Fulk Nerra the Neo-Roman Consul, 987-1040: A Political Biography of the Angevin Count\n  | publisher = University of California Press \n  | location = \n  | isbn = 0-520-07996-5\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Fulk_Nerra_the_Neo_Roman_Consul_987_1040.html?id=KCMUeOEjf8AC\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Booton\n  | first = Diane E. \n  | title = Manuscripts, Market and the Transition to Print in Late Medieval Brittany\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Drw4hGK8OTEC&pg=PA12&lpg=PR4&ots=R2bwQeO6bo&dq=Booton,+Diane+E..+Manuscripts,+Market+and+the+Transition+to+Print+in+Late+Medieval+Brittany\n }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = [[Jim Bradbury|Bradbury]]\n  | first = Jim\n  | coauthor =\n  | year = 2000\n  | title = The Capetians: Kings of France, 987-1328\n  | publisher = Hambledon Continuum\n  | location= London\n  | isbn = 978-1-85285-528-4\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mAgDwx4pS0QC\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | year = 1935\n  | title = The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume\n  | publisher = Columbia University Press, Clarke F Ansley, Editor in Chief  \n  | location = Morningside Heights, New York City, New York, USA\n  | url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Columbia-Encyclopedia-One-Volume/dp/B000O7ZPDG\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = [[David Crouch (historian)|Crouch]]\n  | first = David\n  | coauthor =\n  | year = 2002\n  | title = The Normans: The History of a Dynasty\n  | edition =\n  | publisher = Hambledon\n  | location= London\n  | isbn = 978-1-85285-595-6\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mBRouRJrhz0C\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = [[Jean Delumeau|Delumeau]]\n  | first = Jean\n  | year = 1969\n  | title = Histoire de la Bretagne \n  | publisher = Edouard Privat editeur;
