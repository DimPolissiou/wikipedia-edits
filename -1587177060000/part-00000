There was also [[Are You Being Served? (film)|a 1977 film]], a spin-off series ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' with some of the same main cast in 1991\u201392, and a one-off episode with a new cast in 2016.

The show was also popular in Israel and in the United States, where it gained a loyal and enthusiastic following when [[PBS]] television stations began airing [[rerun]]s of it in the mid-1980s, along with other [[British sitcom]]s. In 2004, it was ranked 20th in a television countdown of ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Britain's Best Sitcom \u2013 Top 11 to 100|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/top11to100.shtml|work=BBC|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> It is regularly repeated worldwide ([[BBC Two]], [[Drama (UK TV channel)|Drama]] and [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]] in the UK; [[PBS]] and [[BBC America]] in the United States; and [[BBC UKTV]], [[Fox Classics]] and [[9Gem]] in Australia).\n\n==Production==\n===Programme conception===\nThe idea for the show came from Lloyd's brief period in the early 1950s working at [[Simpsons of Piccadilly]], a clothing store which traded for over 60 years until 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|title=Going Down: 'Grace Bros' store closes|publisher=BBC|date=1 February 1999}}</ref> The inspiration for the store has also been credited to the former Rossiters of [[Paignton]] department store from the time Lloyd and Croft spent there,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1133485/Store-inspired-Are-You-Being-Served-forced-shut-shop-150-years.html|title=Store that inspired 'Are You Being Served?' forced to shut shop after 150 years|first=Rebecca|last=Camber|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=1 February 2009|location=London}}</ref> and the former Clements of [[Watford]].\n\n===Airing===\n[[File:Are You Being Served series 1 logo.svg|right|thumb|Logo used for the pilot episode and series one; from series two onwards, the quotation marks were removed.]]\nThe [[pilot episode]] was created as part of the ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' series, although the [[BBC]] had originally chosen not to broadcast the programme.

Again!''). The cast performed in character for a stage sketch on the [[BBC One|BBC1]] programme ''Variety'' on 19 June 1976.\n\n===Restoration of the 1972 pilot===\nAlthough the pilot was produced in colour, the [[videotape]] was wiped in the 1970s leaving only a 16mm [[black-and-white]] film [[telerecording]], which was made for international syndication to countries where colour television broadcasts had not been adopted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagebrittv.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/comedy-playhouse-are-you-being-served.html |title=Vintage British TV: Comedy Playhouse \u2013 Are You Being Served?

(film)|Are You Being Served?]]'' film has a different version of the theme song which is longer, in a different key and without the floor announcements. A remix of the theme was released in 1996 by a dance act calling itself \"Grace Brothers\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Grace-Brothers-Are-You-Being-Served/release/1064519|title=Grace Brothers \u2013 Are You Being Served?|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> and featured vocal samples of John Inman and Frank Thornton.\n\nThere is a homage to the theme song in the [[Ladytron]] song \"Paco!\" from the album ''[[604 (album)|604]]'', and New Zealand band [[Minuit (band)|Minuit]]'s \"I hate guns\". A lugubrious version of the theme song is featured on the album ''[[The Ape of Naples]]'' by the [[experimental music]] group [[Coil (band)|Coil]]. The theme song has also been covered by Australian band [[Regurgitator]] on their 1999 album ''[[...art]]''. Pop singer [[Jamelia]]'s song \"Window Shopping\" (from her 2006 album ''[[Walk with Me (Jamelia album)|Walk with Me]]'') begins with a sample of the familiar cash register sound effect as well as Mrs Slocombe's voice inquiring, \"Good morning, Mr Grainger; are you free?\"\n\nThe song was also used in a 2016 [[Audi]] advertisement for their [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]] range.\n\n===International broadcasts===\n\nThe series was shown in the United States on [[PBS]] stations and on [[BBC America]], as well as in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations around the world. PBS first began airing it (on 24 stations) in 1987, and viewership steadily climbed as more stations carried it. By the early 1990s, it had gained such a loyal following that American viewers of the show formed fan clubs and were in large attendance wherever cast members made guest appearances.\n\n''Are You Being Served?'' aired in Canada in prime time on [[Global Television Network]] in the mid 1980s and late night on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]. It also became available to Canadian viewers on PBS station WNED (Buffalo).  The show aired on Saturday evening prime time from the mid 1980s to late 1990s.\n\nThe series was also extremely popular in Australia.

In addition, there were [[sight gag]]s generated by outrageous costumes which the characters were sometimes required to wear for store promotions, and gaudy store displays frequently featuring malfunctioning robotic mannequins. The show is remembered for its prolific use of [[double entendre]]s.\n\nThe main humorous base of the series was a merciless parody of the [[social structure of the United Kingdom|British class system]]. This permeated almost every interaction and was especially evident in the conversations between the maintenance men and the ostensibly higher-class store personnel. The episodes rarely left the store, and to parody the stereotype of the British class system, characters rarely addressed each other by their first names, even after work, instead using their formal titled names (\"Mr\", \"Mrs\", \"Miss\", or even \"Captain\"). When they did address each other by their first names, it was usually either as an aside, or often for comic effect (e.g. an underling addressing a superior). The joke is that lower-class people, even when married, addressed each other as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" Middle-class and upper-class people on familiar terms always use given names or nicknames. The use of titles is therefore a pretention to being posh or refined.\n\n=== Main characters ===\n{{Main|List of Are You Being Served? characters}}\n*'''[[Mrs. Betty Slocombe]]''' ([[Mollie Sugden]]) (Series 1\u201310), a senior sales assistant and head of the ladies' department. She is known for her changing hair colour and conversations about her cat Tittles, which she always refers to as \"me pussy\".\n*'''[[Miss Brahms|Miss Shirley Brahms]]''' ([[Wendy Richard]]) (Series 1\u201310), a young, attractive, working-class, [[cockney]]-speaking junior sales assistant to Mrs Slocombe.\n* '''Mr Ernest Grainger''' ([[Arthur Brough]]) (Series 1\u20135), a 40-year veteran of Grace Brothers, a senior sales assistant and head of the gents' department, who often falls asleep on the job, is usually grumpy, and wears a measuring tape over his shoulders. Arthur Brough died before the filming of Season 6.\n** '''Mr Percival Tebbs''' ([[James Hayter (actor)|James Hayter]]) (Series 6), Mr Grainger's replacement. He retired after only one year in the men's department.\n** '''Mr Harry Goldberg''' ([[Alfie Bass]]) (Series 7), Mr Tebbs's replacement. Originally the junior salesman, he was quickly promoted to senior after proving to be a master salesman. Like Tebbs, Goldberg lasted only one year.\n** '''Mr Grossman''' ([[Milo Sperber]]) (Series 8), an expert shoe salesman, joined the gents' department, when some of the floor space was given over to shoes. He lasted only four episodes.\n** '''Mr Abraham Klein''' ([[Benny Lee]]) (Series 8), joined the gents' department to help out with upcoming sales in the store. Klein lasted only four episodes.\n*'''[[Mr Humphries|Mr Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries]]''' ([[John Inman]]) (Series 1\u201310), a sales assistant in gents'; a [[Camp (style)|camp]]-acting man who lives with his mother, also played on several occasions by [[John Inman]]. He made frequent use of [[double entendre]], especially related to his implied [[gay]] lifestyle.  He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] by talking directly to the television audience, unusual at the time of the original broadcast.\n* '''Mr James/Dick Lucas''' ([[Trevor Bannister]]) (Series 1\u20137), the young, penniless, womanising junior salesman; a source of irritation to the female sales staff. Always referred to as the department 'junior', but Bannister was in fact one year older than Inman. The character left the series after Series 7 (1979). (In Series 2 his name was given as \"James\" but was stated as \"Dick\" in Series 5 and 6). Wendy Richard claimed in an interview that the series was originally devised as a \"vehicle\" for Trevor Bannister, which suggests that Mr Lucas was intended to be the series main character, the early series' story lines bear this out.{{Citation needed |reason=Interview with whom and when? |date=March 2019}}\n** '''Mr Bert Spooner''' ([[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]]) (Series 8\u201310), eventually replaced Mr Lucas as gents' junior sales assistant and was similar to him in many ways.\n*'''[[Captain Peacock|\"Captain\" Stephen Peacock]]''' ([[Frank Thornton]]) (Series 1\u201310), the haughty [[floorwalker]]{{Discuss |section=Floorwalker stub article}} (an employee who both supervises sales staff and assists customers) who purportedly fought in the [[North Africa Campaign]] of World War II but was accused of actually being in the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Service Corps]] and never seeing combat.\n* '''Mr Cuthbert Rumbold''' ([[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]]) (Series 1\u201310), the autocratic, obsequious (to the Grace brothers), yet bumbling and incompetent floor manager.\n* '''\"Young\" Mr Grace''' ([[Harold Bennett]]) (Series 1\u20138), the very old, rich but stingy store owner, surrounded by attractive young women. The character's final appearance was in 1981 following Bennett's death. The character was killed off in the first episode of the spinoff series ''[[Grace & Favour]]''.\n** '''\"Old\" Mr Grace''' ([[Kenneth Waller]]) (Series 8), \"Young\" Mr Grace's even-older brother&nbsp;\u2013 replaced him at the store when he took a sabbatical to write his memoirs. In Series 9 & 10, the management of the store was again attributed to \"Young\" Mr. Grace, who was by then an invisible character.\n* '''Miss Belfridge''' ([[Candy Davis]]), the last and longest-running of Mr Rumbold's secretaries. She was admired by all male staff, including Mr Humphries and especially Captain Peacock, who dined her at [[The Ritz Hotel, London|The Ritz Hotel]].\n* '''Mr Mash''' ([[Larry Martyn]]) (Series 1-3), the stock and maintenance man who installed mechanised display units in store and was often scolded by Captain Peacock for being on the floor during opening hours. \n** '''Mr Beverley Harman''' ([[Arthur English]]) (Series 4\u201310), Mr. Mash's replacement. Mr. Rumbold calls him \"Harry\" in seasons 5 and 9, but in season 9 he states his name is actually \"Beverly\".\n* '''Diana Yardswick''' ([[Doremy Vernon]]), the manageress of Grace Brothers' canteen at which the staff had their lunch. Known for serving grossly unappetising food, and for her ill temper and sarcasm, as well as for enforcing strict social order, which dictated that management, sales staff and the maintenance crew and lift operators all dine separately.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Are You Being Served? episodes}}\n''Are You Being Served?'' was initially broadcast from 1973 to 1985. Each series had between four and nine episodes. Counting the pilot episode, all episodes and specials from the series, and the film, the show ran for sixty-nine episodes and ten series.\n\nUnlike many sitcoms, each episode was self-contained, there being no continuing story or theme throughout a series. For example, we find out there are certain rules that staff should follow in one episode, it is no longer in place in further episodes. It becomes apparent that the male staff should wear hats appropriate to their status. Capt. Peacock is informed by Mr. Rumbold that a Floor Walker should wear a [[homburg hat|homburg]], not a [[Bowler hat|bowler]]. Neither Mr. Humphries nor Mr. Lucas have worn hats up to this point, but both have to purchase one. At the end of the episode Young Mr. Grace informs Capt. Peacock that a homburg doesn't suit him and he should wear a bowler \"all the time\". However, in all future episodes, when he arrives with a hat on, it is a homburg and Mr. Humphries and Mr. Lucas also go back to not wearing hats.\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|Are You Being Served? (film)}}\nIn 1977, as for many other popular [[wikt:British|British]] sitcoms of the time, a feature film was produced. The British film industry assumed at the time that audiences wouldn't come to the cinema unless enticed by a plot they couldn't get from their television, so they demanded bigger plots for such films. The [[Are You Being Served? (film)|film version]] of ''Are You Being Served?'' followed this trend, following the staff as they take a package holiday together while the store is closed for redecoration, a loose adaptation of the play version from the year before. Set in the fictional resort of Costa Plonka, in Spain, the entire cast of the television series reprised their roles in the film.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, pp.&nbsp;181-183</ref> Reviews of the film were generally negative, with one reviewer declaring, \"The humour consists mainly of withering selection of patent British puns; an inflatable brassiere, some let's-insult-the-Germans jokes and a rickey thunder-box which bolts from the outside are thrown in for good measure.\"<ref name=\"mfb-review\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Are You Being Served?|last=Pym|first=John|volume=44|issue=516|year=1977|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===''The Best of Are You Being Served?'' (1992)===\nBuoyed by the huge success of the series in the United States, [[BBC America]] commissioned a special straight-to-VHS compilation in 1992. Running at 78 minutes, ''The Best of Are You Being Served'' featured newly-shot scenes of Mr Humphries reminiscing with his elderly mother, Annie, about his time working at Grace Brothers. Both roles were played by [[John Inman]]. The additional sequences were filmed in America, and directed by Don Hopfer.\n\n===2016 revival===\nIn 2016, a one-off revival episode was announced and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10 studios]]. It was broadcast as part of BBC's [[Landmark Sitcom Season]], a celebration of 60 years of television sitcoms.<ref name=media/> It was set in 1988 with the original characters, played by a new cast.<ref>{{cite news |title=All-star cast of Are You Being Served? remake spotted arriving for filming at Salford Quays |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/star-cast-you-being-served-10996391 |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]}}</ref>\n\nCaptain Peacock was played by [[John Challis]], Mrs Slocombe by [[Sherrie Hewson]], Mr Humphries by [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]], Miss Brahms by [[Niky Wardley]], Mr Grainger by [[Roy Barraclough]] (Grainger having come out of retirement \"To spend less time with his wife\"), Mr Harman by [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]], and Mr Rumbold by [[Justin Edwards (actor)|Justin Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2035/are_you_being_served_2016_cast_watkins_hewson/|title=New Are You Being Served? cast revealed|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|date=22 February 2016|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35774053|title=Alf Garnett back as part of BBC sitcom revival|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> New characters in the show were Young Mr Grace's grandson&nbsp;\u2013 also called Young Mr Grace&nbsp;\u2013 played by [[Mathew Horne]], Miss Croft&nbsp;\u2013 named as a tribute to series co-creator David Croft&nbsp;\u2013 played by [[Jorgie Porter]], and newcomer Mr Conway, played by [[Kayode Ewumi]]. The episode was written by [[Derren Litten]]. The BBC issued a press release saying: \"It's 1988 and Young Mr Grace is determined to drag Grace Brothers into, well 1988, but he has a problem on his hands. Mr Humphries, Captain Peacock, Mr Rumbold and Mrs Slocombe all seem to be stuck in another era.

Though all felt the department store format was exhausted, it was suggested the characters could be moved to a new location. In 1992, most of the original cast reunited for ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' (known as ''Are You Being Served Again!'' in the United States and Canada). The new series followed the characters after Young Mr. Grace's death, when they are forced to run a hotel in a dilapidated manor house that was purchased using their pension fund. ''Grace & Favour'' ran for two series.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, pp.&nbsp;175-179</ref>\n\n===Play===\nIn the summer of 1976, a stage adaptation of ''Are You Being Served?'' ran at the Winter Gardens in [[Blackpool]]. Directed by Robert Redfarn, [[John Inman]], [[Mollie Sugden]], [[Frank Thornton]], [[Wendy Richard]], and [[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]] reprised their characters from the television show while the characters of Mr. Lucas, Mr. Grainger, and Mr. Mash were recast. The play had basically the same plot as the [[Are You Being Served? (film)|film version]] which would debut the next year, though Young Mr. Grace's role was omitted entirely and Mr. Mash had less to do than Mr. Harman in the film. Reviews for the play were mixed; a writer for the Blackpool ''Diarist of the Stage'' declared it the funniest show he'd seen in thirty years, while Michael Leapman from ''[[The Times]]'', declared the play to be worthless except for the final line, though he admitted he'd never seen the television show.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, p.&nbsp;186</ref> The play has occasionally been run at other theaters since, including in 2012 at the Manifest Theater in [[Manningtree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manifesttheatre.co.uk/productions/are_you_being_served.shtml|title=Manifest Theatre - Are You Being Served|website=www.manifesttheatre.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American adaptation===\n{{Main|Beane's of Boston}}\nIn 1979, [[Garry Marshall]], in the midst of success producing and directing ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, produced a pilot for an American version of ''Are You Being Served?'' At the time, Americanised versions of British series, including ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', and ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' were doing well in the ratings, and Marshall hoped to capitalise on this with his script for ''[[Beane's of Boston]]''. [[Jeremy Lloyd|Jeremy Lloyd's]] ''[[Laugh-In]]'' partner, [[Alan Sues]], was cast as Mr. Humphries, a decision Lloyd regretted, saying Sues had been miscast. Other cast included future ''[[Magnum PI]]'' star [[John Hillerman]] as Mr. Peacock, [[Charlotte Rae]] as Mrs. Slocombe, and [[Lorna Patterson]] as Miss Brahms. Ultimately, CBS passed on ''Beane's of Boston'' and a full series was not produced.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs (1995), p.&nbsp;187</ref>\n\n===Australian adaptation===\n{{Main|Are You Being Served? (Australian TV series)}}\nAn Australian adaptation, also called ''[[Are You Being Served? (Australian TV series)|Are You Being Served?]]'', ran for two series and sixteen episodes from 1980 to 1981 on [[Network Ten]]. It starred [[John Inman]] as Mr Humphries, who travels to Australia on loan from Grace Brothers to work for the Grace brothers' cousin, Mr. Bone at his department store, Bone Brothers. Renamed versions of characters from the original series rounded out the cast including [[June Bronhill]] as Mrs. Crawford, a copy of Mrs. Slocombe, and Reg Gillam as Captain Wagstaff, a copy of Captain Peacock. [[Jeremy Lloyd]] adapted episodes for the show from his own scripts from the British ''Are You Being Served'', drawing from the then-new episodes of the seventh series for series one of the Australian version, and a selection of older episodes for series two. Lloyd would later say he hated the process of adapting the episodes, which were mostly left intact with the exception of some topical jokes, which were changed or deleted.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, pp.&nbsp;187-188</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe series gained much of its popularity with TV viewers by \"[[pushing the envelope]]\" through its deliberate-yet-subtle use of [[Sexual suggestiveness|risqu\u00e9]] [[visual gag]]s, [[innuendo]]-infused dialogue and cleverly-disguised [[sophomoric humor|sophomoric humour]]. These comical devices also attracted some mild criticism, in part for relying on sexual [[stereotype]]s and [[double entendre]]s&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., Mrs Slocombe discussing her cat: \"Animals are very psychic...the least sign of danger and my [[Pussy#Female genitalia|pussy]]'s hair stands on end\".\n\nJohn Inman's portrayal of Humphries' over-the-top antics and sharp-tongued, witty responses, along with his trademark [[catch-phrase]] \"I'm free!\", were enthusiastically embraced by many audience members, and the character evolved into a [[gay icon]] in popular culture.  Despite this, Inman pointed out that Mr Humphries' true sexual orientation was never explicitly stated in the series, and David Croft said in an interview that the character was not homosexual, but \"just a mother's boy\".<ref>{{cite news|title=I'm Free! \u2013 The Complete ''Are You Being Served?''|publisher=Orion Books|year=1999}}</ref> In an episode of the spin-off ''[[Grace & Favour]]'', the character is further described as neither a \"woman's man\" nor a \"man's man\" and as being \"in limbo\".\n\nThe characters (Mr Humphries especially) sometimes broke the [[fourth wall]] for comical effect.\n\n==Merchandise==\nSeven early episodes were novelised for a book, written by Jeremy Lloyd, called ''Are You Being Served? \u2013 Camping in and other Fiascos''. This was written in 1976, and republished in 1997 by ''KQED Books''. The seven episodes featured are \"Camping In\", \"Up Captain Peacock\", \"Wedding Bells\", \"His and Hers\", \"Coffee Morning\", \"The Hand of Fate\" and \"The Clock\".\n\nIn 1995, KQED Books published ''Are You Being Served \u2013 The Inside Story'' by [[Adrian Rigelsford]], Anthony Brown, and Geoff Tibbals, with a foreword by Jeremy Lloyd, and sub-titled: ''The Inside Story of Britain's Funniest \u2013 and Public Television's Favorite \u2013 Comedy Series''. In 212 pages, the book's six chapters cover: The Cast of Characters, Behind the Scenes, The Episodes, The Spin-offs, Trivia Quiz, and Glossary. {{ISBN|0-912333-04-9}}.\n\nIn 1999, ''I'm Free! The Complete Are You Being Served?'', a guide to the series, was published by [[Orion Books]]. It was written by Richard Webber, with contributions from David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd.\n\nA board game was also produced in the 1970s.  Players moved round a board resembling the shop floor to purchase one item from each of the four counters and leave the store, before their opponents and without going over budget.\n\n===DVD releases===\nAll ten series, including a black and white version of the pilot episode, and all five Christmas specials from those years, as well as both series of ''Grace & Favour'' are now available on DVD in the UK (Region 2). ''Are You Being Served?: the Movie'' was released in 2002. A colour-restored version of the original pilot episode has yet to be released commercially.\n\nAll ten series, as well as both series of ''Grace & Favour'' (in packaging titled ''Are You Being Served?

There was also [[Are You Being Served? (film)|a 1977 film]], a spin-off series ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' with some of the same main cast in 1991\u201392, and a one-off episode with a new cast in 2016. Since its original release, all 69 episodes, the restored pilot, the Christmas specials, the sequel and the film have been released on DVD.\n\n''Are You Being Served?'' was a great success in the UK and was also popular in three other countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (Canada, New Zealand, and Australia), and was successfully aired in The Netherlands and Belgium with Dutch subtitles. The show was also popular in Israel and in the United States, where it gained a loyal and enthusiastic following when [[PBS]] television stations began airing [[rerun]]s of it in the mid-1980s, along with other [[British sitcom]]s. In 2004, it was ranked 20th in a television countdown of ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Britain's Best Sitcom \u2013 Top 11 to 100|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/top11to100.shtml|work=BBC|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref> It is regularly repeated worldwide ([[BBC Two]], [[Drama (UK TV channel)|Drama]] and [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]] in the UK; [[PBS]] and [[BBC America]] in the United States; and [[BBC UKTV]], [[Fox Classics]] and [[9Gem]] in Australia).\n\n==Production==\n===Programme conception===\nThe idea for the show came from Lloyd's brief period in the early 1950s working at [[Simpsons of Piccadilly]], a clothing store which traded for over 60 years until 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|title=Going Down: 'Grace Bros' store closes|publisher=BBC|date=1 February 1999}}</ref> The inspiration for the store has also been credited to the former Rossiters of [[Paignton]] department store from the time Lloyd and Croft spent there,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1133485/Store-inspired-Are-You-Being-Served-forced-shut-shop-150-years.html|title=Store that inspired 'Are You Being Served?' forced to shut shop after 150 years|first=Rebecca|last=Camber|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=1 February 2009|location=London}}</ref> and the former Clements of [[Watford]].\n\n===Airing===\n[[File:Are You Being Served series 1 logo.svg|right|thumb|Logo used for the pilot episode and series one; from series two onwards, the quotation marks were removed.]]\nThe [[pilot episode]] was created as part of the ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' series, although the [[BBC]] had originally chosen not to broadcast the programme. The pilot was used as a filler during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] when the coverage of the Olympiad was interrupted by the [[Munich massacre]] on 8 September 1972, leading to a full series being produced.<ref name=\"1972Olympics\">{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6430147.stm |title=Obituary: John Inman |accessdate=4 October 2015 |work=BBC News}}</ref> This first episode was repeated at the beginning of the first series on 14 March 1973. Although the first series was aired in the same timeslot as ''[[Coronation Street]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], consequently receiving relatively little attention, the repeats shown later in the year were much more successful.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1490146.ece|title=Obituary \u2013 John Inman|newspaper=The Times|date=9 March 2007 | location=London|first1=Sam|last1=Coates|first2=Anushka|last2=Asthana}}</ref>\n\nThe show became a ratings hit, and after a successful 13-year run, ''Are You Being Served?'' came to an end on 1 April 1985.\n\nOf the original cast, only [[Frank Thornton]], [[Mollie Sugden]], [[John Inman]], [[Wendy Richard]] and [[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]] appeared in all 69 episodes of the programme's 13-year run; these five later featured in the sequel sitcom, ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' (also known as ''Are You Being Served? Again!''). The cast performed in character for a stage sketch on the [[BBC One|BBC1]] programme ''Variety'' on 19 June 1976.\n\n===Restoration of the 1972 pilot===\nAlthough the pilot was produced in colour, the [[videotape]] was wiped in the 1970s leaving only a 16mm [[black-and-white]] film [[telerecording]], which was made for international syndication to countries where colour television broadcasts had not been adopted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagebrittv.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/comedy-playhouse-are-you-being-served.html |title=Vintage British TV: Comedy Playhouse \u2013 Are You Being Served?

The restored colour version was first shown on BBC2 on 1 January 2010 as part of a special ''Are You Being Served?'' night.\n\n===Theme song===\n<div style=\"position:relative; float:right; clear:right; border:1px solid #ccc; background:white; font-size:85%; width:300px; padding-top:10px; padding-left:10px; margin:0 0 .5em .5em;\">\n<span style=\"font-size:115%\">'''Audio samples of ''Are You Being Served?'''''</span>&nbsp;([[Wikipedia:Media help|media help]])\n{{listen\n| filename    = Are You Being Served.ogg\n| title       = \"Are You Being Served?\" theme\n| description =\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n</ul></div>\nThe theme song, written by the show's co-writer [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] and composer [[Ronnie Hazlehurst]], consists of a [[elevator operator|lift girl]] (whose voice was provided by Stephanie Gathercole) announcing each floor over the ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' sounds of a [[cash register]] (which effectively serves as the only percussion instrument) and a simple musical [[accompaniment]].\n\nThe 1977 ''[[Are You Being Served? (film)|Are You Being Served?]]'' film has a different version of the theme song which is longer, in a different key and without the floor announcements. A remix of the theme was released in 1996 by a dance act calling itself \"Grace Brothers\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Grace-Brothers-Are-You-Being-Served/release/1064519|title=Grace Brothers \u2013 Are You Being Served?|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> and featured vocal samples of John Inman and Frank Thornton.\n\nThere is a homage to the theme song in the [[Ladytron]] song \"Paco!\" from the album ''[[604 (album)|604]]'', and New Zealand band [[Minuit (band)|Minuit]]'s \"I hate guns\". A lugubrious version of the theme song is featured on the album ''[[The Ape of Naples]]'' by the [[experimental music]] group [[Coil (band)|Coil]]. The theme song has also been covered by Australian band [[Regurgitator]] on their 1999 album ''[[...art]]''. Pop singer [[Jamelia]]'s song \"Window Shopping\" (from her 2006 album ''[[Walk with Me (Jamelia album)|Walk with Me]]'') begins with a sample of the familiar cash register sound effect as well as Mrs Slocombe's voice inquiring, \"Good morning, Mr Grainger; are you free?\"\n\nThe song was also used in a 2016 [[Audi]] advertisement for their [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]] range.\n\n===International broadcasts===\n\nThe series was shown in the United States on [[PBS]] stations and on [[BBC America]], as well as in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations around the world. PBS first began airing it (on 24 stations) in 1987, and viewership steadily climbed as more stations carried it. By the early 1990s, it had gained such a loyal following that American viewers of the show formed fan clubs and were in large attendance wherever cast members made guest appearances.\n\n''Are You Being Served?'' aired in Canada in prime time on [[Global Television Network]] in the mid 1980s and late night on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]. It also became available to Canadian viewers on PBS station WNED (Buffalo).  The show aired on Saturday evening prime time from the mid 1980s to late 1990s.\n\nThe series was also extremely popular in Australia. It started on [[ABC Television]] in 1974 and was repeated by ABC in Australia several times.<ref name=\"19860602CollierShayneAgain\">Collier, Shayne. Again and again and again.

In addition, there were [[sight gag]]s generated by outrageous costumes which the characters were sometimes required to wear for store promotions, and gaudy store displays frequently featuring malfunctioning robotic mannequins. The show is remembered for its prolific use of [[double entendre]]s.\n\nThe main humorous base of the series was a merciless parody of the [[social structure of the United Kingdom|British class system]]. This permeated almost every interaction and was especially evident in the conversations between the maintenance men and the ostensibly higher-class store personnel. The episodes rarely left the store, and to parody the stereotype of the British class system, characters rarely addressed each other by their first names, even after work, instead using their formal titled names (\"Mr\", \"Mrs\", \"Miss\", or even \"Captain\"). When they did address each other by their first names, it was usually either as an aside, or often for comic effect (e.g. an underling addressing a superior). The joke is that lower-class people, even when married, addressed each other as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" Middle-class and upper-class people on familiar terms always use given names or nicknames. The use of titles is therefore a pretention to being posh or refined.\n\n=== Main characters ===\n{{Main|List of Are You Being Served? characters}}\n*'''[[Mrs. Betty Slocombe]]''' ([[Mollie Sugden]]) (Series 1\u201310), a senior sales assistant and head of the ladies' department. She is known for her changing hair colour and conversations about her cat, which she always refers to as \"me pussy\".\n*'''[[Miss Brahms|Miss Shirley Brahms]]''' ([[Wendy Richard]]) (Series 1\u201310), a young, attractive, working-class, [[cockney]]-speaking junior sales assistant to Mrs Slocombe.\n* '''Mr Ernest Grainger''' ([[Arthur Brough]]) (Series 1\u20135), a 40-year veteran of Grace Brothers, a senior sales assistant and head of the gents' department, who often falls asleep on the job, is usually grumpy, and wears a measuring tape over his shoulders. Arthur Brough died before the filming of Season 6.\n** '''Mr Percival Tebbs''' ([[James Hayter (actor)|James Hayter]]) (Series 6), Mr Grainger's replacement. He retired after only one year in the men's department.\n** '''Mr Harry Goldberg''' ([[Alfie Bass]]) (Series 7), Mr Tebbs's replacement. Originally the junior salesman, he was quickly promoted to senior after proving to be a master salesman. Like Tebbs, Goldberg lasted only one year.\n** '''Mr Grossman''' ([[Milo Sperber]]) (Series 8), an expert shoe salesman, joined the gents' department, when some of the floor space was given over to shoes. He lasted only four episodes.\n** '''Mr Abraham Klein''' ([[Benny Lee]]) (Series 8), joined the gents' department to help out with upcoming sales in the store. Klein lasted only four episodes.\n*'''[[Mr Humphries|Mr Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries]]''' ([[John Inman]]) (Series 1\u201310), a sales assistant in gents'; a [[Camp (style)|camp]]-acting man who lives with his mother, also played on several occasions by [[John Inman]]. He made frequent use of [[double entendre]], especially related to his implied [[gay]] lifestyle.  He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] by talking directly to the television audience, unusual at the time of the original broadcast.\n* '''Mr James/Dick Lucas''' ([[Trevor Bannister]]) (Series 1\u20137), the young, penniless, womanising junior salesman; a source of irritation to the female sales staff. Always referred to as the department 'junior', but Bannister was in fact one year older than Inman. The character left the series after Series 7 (1979). (In Series 2 his name was given as \"James\" but was stated as \"Dick\" in Series 5 and 6). Wendy Richard claimed in an interview that the series was originally devised as a \"vehicle\" for Trevor Bannister, which suggests that Mr Lucas was intended to be the series main character, the early series' story lines bear this out.{{Citation needed |reason=Interview with whom and when? |date=March 2019}}\n** '''Mr Bert Spooner''' ([[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]]) (Series 8\u201310), eventually replaced Mr Lucas as gents' junior sales assistant and was similar to him in many ways.\n*'''[[Captain Peacock|\"Captain\" Stephen Peacock]]''' ([[Frank Thornton]]) (Series 1\u201310), the haughty [[floorwalker]]{{Discuss |section=Floorwalker stub article}} (an employee who both supervises sales staff and assists customers) who purportedly fought in the [[North Africa Campaign]] of World War II but was accused of actually being in the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Service Corps]] and never seeing combat.\n* '''Mr Cuthbert Rumbold''' ([[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]]) (Series 1\u201310), the autocratic, obsequious (to the Grace brothers), yet bumbling and incompetent floor manager.\n* '''\"Young\" Mr Grace''' ([[Harold Bennett]]) (Series 1\u20138), the very old, rich but stingy store owner, surrounded by attractive young women. The character's final appearance was in 1981 following Bennett's death. The character was killed off in the first episode of the spinoff series ''[[Grace & Favour]]''.\n** '''\"Old\" Mr Grace''' ([[Kenneth Waller]]) (Series 8), \"Young\" Mr Grace's even-older brother&nbsp;\u2013 replaced him at the store when he took a sabbatical to write his memoirs. In Series 9 & 10, the management of the store was again attributed to \"Young\" Mr. Grace, who was by then an invisible character.\n* '''Miss Belfridge''' ([[Candy Davis]]), the last and longest-running of Mr Rumbold's secretaries. She was admired by all male staff, including Mr Humphries and especially Captain Peacock, who dined her at [[The Ritz Hotel, London|The Ritz Hotel]].\n* '''Mr Mash''' ([[Larry Martyn]]) (Series 1-3), the stock and maintenance man who installed mechanised display units in store and was often scolded by Captain Peacock for being on the floor during opening hours. \n** '''Mr Beverley Harman''' ([[Arthur English]]) (Series 4\u201310), Mr. Mash's replacement. Mr. Rumbold calls him \"Harry\" in seasons 5 and 9, but in season 9 he states his name is actually \"Beverly\".\n* '''Diana Yardswick''' ([[Doremy Vernon]]), the manageress of Grace Brothers' canteen at which the staff had their lunch. Known for serving grossly unappetising food, and for her ill temper and sarcasm, as well as for enforcing strict social order, which dictated that management, sales staff and the maintenance crew and lift operators all dine separately.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Are You Being Served? episodes}}\n''Are You Being Served?'' was initially broadcast from 1973 to 1985. Each series had between four and nine episodes. Counting the pilot episode, all episodes and specials from the series, and the film, the show ran for sixty-nine episodes and ten series.\n\nUnlike many sitcoms, each episode was self-contained, there being no continuing story or theme throughout a series. For example, we find out there are certain rules that staff should follow in one episode, it is no longer in place in further episodes. It becomes apparent that the male staff should wear hats appropriate to their status. Capt. Peacock is informed by Mr. Rumbold that a Floor Walker should wear a [[homburg hat|homburg]], not a [[Bowler hat|bowler]]. Neither Mr. Humphries nor Mr. Lucas have worn hats up to this point, but both have to purchase one. At the end of the episode Young Mr. Grace informs Capt. Peacock that a homburg doesn't suit him and he should wear a bowler \"all the time\". However, in all future episodes, when he arrives with a hat on, it is a homburg and Mr. Humphries and Mr. Lucas also go back to not wearing hats.\n\n===Film===\n{{Main|Are You Being Served? (film)}}\nIn 1977, as for many other popular [[wikt:British|British]] sitcoms of the time, a feature film was produced. The British film industry assumed at the time that audiences wouldn't come to the cinema unless enticed by a plot they couldn't get from their television, so they demanded bigger plots for such films. The [[Are You Being Served? (film)|film version]] of ''Are You Being Served?'' followed this trend, following the staff as they take a package holiday together while the store is closed for redecoration, a loose adaptation of the play version from the year before. Set in the fictional resort of Costa Plonka, in Spain, the entire cast of the television series reprised their roles in the film.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, pp.&nbsp;181-183</ref> Reviews of the film were generally negative, with one reviewer declaring, \"The humour consists mainly of withering selection of patent British puns; an inflatable brassiere, some let's-insult-the-Germans jokes and a rickey thunder-box which bolts from the outside are thrown in for good measure.\"<ref name=\"mfb-review\">{{cite journal|journal=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Are You Being Served?|last=Pym|first=John|volume=44|issue=516|year=1977|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===''The Best of Are You Being Served?'' (1992)===\nBuoyed by the huge success of the series in the United States, [[BBC America]] commissioned a special straight-to-VHS compilation in 1992. Running at 78 minutes, ''The Best of Are You Being Served'' featured newly-shot scenes of Mr Humphries reminiscing with his elderly mother, Annie, about his time working at Grace Brothers. Both roles were played by [[John Inman]]. The additional sequences were filmed in America, and directed by Don Hopfer.\n\n===2016 revival===\nIn 2016, a one-off revival episode was announced and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10 studios]]. It was broadcast as part of BBC's [[Landmark Sitcom Season]], a celebration of 60 years of television sitcoms.<ref name=media/> It was set in 1988 with the original characters, played by a new cast.<ref>{{cite news |title=All-star cast of Are You Being Served? remake spotted arriving for filming at Salford Quays |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/star-cast-you-being-served-10996391 |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]}}</ref>\n\nCaptain Peacock was played by [[John Challis]], Mrs Slocombe by [[Sherrie Hewson]], Mr Humphries by [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]], Miss Brahms by [[Niky Wardley]], Mr Grainger by [[Roy Barraclough]] (Grainger having come out of retirement \"To spend less time with his wife\"), Mr Harman by [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]], and Mr Rumbold by [[Justin Edwards (actor)|Justin Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/2035/are_you_being_served_2016_cast_watkins_hewson/|title=New Are You Being Served? cast revealed|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|date=22 February 2016|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35774053|title=Alf Garnett back as part of BBC sitcom revival|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=10 March 2016|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> New characters in the show were Young Mr Grace's grandson&nbsp;\u2013 also called Young Mr Grace&nbsp;\u2013 played by [[Mathew Horne]], Miss Croft&nbsp;\u2013 named as a tribute to series co-creator David Croft&nbsp;\u2013 played by [[Jorgie Porter]], and newcomer Mr Conway, played by [[Kayode Ewumi]]. The episode was written by [[Derren Litten]]. The BBC issued a press release saying: \"It's 1988 and Young Mr Grace is determined to drag Grace Brothers into, well 1988, but he has a problem on his hands. Mr Humphries, Captain Peacock, Mr Rumbold and Mrs Slocombe all seem to be stuck in another era.

Though all felt the department store format was exhausted, it was suggested the characters could be moved to a new location. In 1992, most of the original cast reunited for ''[[Grace & Favour]]'' (known as ''Are You Being Served Again!'' in the United States and Canada). The new series followed the characters after Young Mr. Grace's death, when they are forced to run a hotel in a dilapidated manor house that was purchased using their pension fund. ''Grace & Favour'' ran for two series.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, pp.&nbsp;175-179</ref>\n\n===Play===\nIn the summer of 1976, a stage adaptation of ''Are You Being Served?'' ran at the Winter Gardens in [[Blackpool]]. Directed by Robert Redfarn, [[John Inman]], [[Mollie Sugden]], [[Frank Thornton]], [[Wendy Richard]], and [[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]] reprised their characters from the television show while the characters of Mr. Lucas, Mr. Grainger, and Mr. Mash were recast. The play had basically the same plot as the [[Are You Being Served? (film)|film version]] which would debut the next year, though Young Mr. Grace's role was omitted entirely and Mr. Mash had less to do than Mr. Harman in the film. Reviews for the play were mixed; a writer for the Blackpool ''Diarist of the Stage'' declared it the funniest show he'd seen in thirty years, while Michael Leapman from ''[[The Times]]'', declared the play to be worthless except for the final line, though he admitted he'd never seen the television show.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, p.&nbsp;186</ref> The play has occasionally been run at other theaters since, including in 2012 at the Manifest Theater in [[Manningtree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manifesttheatre.co.uk/productions/are_you_being_served.shtml|title=Manifest Theatre - Are You Being Served|website=www.manifesttheatre.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American adaptation===\n{{Main|Beane's of Boston}}\nIn 1979, [[Garry Marshall]], in the midst of success producing and directing ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, produced a pilot for an American version of ''Are You Being Served?'' At the time, Americanised versions of British series, including ''[[Three's Company]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', and ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' were doing well in the ratings, and Marshall hoped to capitalise on this with his script for ''[[Beane's of Boston]]''. [[Jeremy Lloyd|Jeremy Lloyd's]] ''[[Laugh-In]]'' partner, [[Alan Sues]], was cast as Mr. Humphries, a decision Lloyd regretted, saying Sues had been miscast. Other cast included future ''[[Magnum PI]]'' star [[John Hillerman]] as Mr. Peacock, [[Charlotte Rae]] as Mrs. Slocombe, and [[Lorna Patterson]] as Miss Brahms. Ultimately, CBS passed on ''Beane's of Boston'' and a full series was not produced.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs (1995), p.&nbsp;187</ref>\n\n===Australian adaptation===\n{{Main|Are You Being Served? (Australian TV series)}}\nAn Australian adaptation, also called ''[[Are You Being Served? (Australian TV series)|Are You Being Served?]]'', ran for two series and sixteen episodes from 1980 to 1981 on [[Network Ten]]. It starred [[John Inman]] as Mr Humphries, who travels to Australia on loan from Grace Brothers to work for the Grace brothers' cousin, Mr. Bone at his department store, Bone Brothers. Renamed versions of characters from the original series rounded out the cast including [[June Bronhill]] as Mrs. Crawford, a copy of Mrs. Slocombe, and Reg Gillam as Captain Wagstaff, a copy of Captain Peacock. [[Jeremy Lloyd]] adapted episodes for the show from his own scripts from the British ''Are You Being Served'', drawing from the then-new episodes of the seventh series for series one of the Australian version, and a selection of older episodes for series two. Lloyd would later say he hated the process of adapting the episodes, which were mostly left intact with the exception of some topical jokes, which were changed or deleted.<ref>Rigelsford, Brown, and Tibballs, pp.&nbsp;187-188</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe series gained much of its popularity with TV viewers by \"[[pushing the envelope]]\" through its deliberate-yet-subtle use of [[Sexual suggestiveness|risqu\u00e9]] [[visual gag]]s, [[innuendo]]-infused dialogue and cleverly-disguised [[sophomoric humor|sophomoric humour]]. These comical devices also attracted some mild criticism, in part for relying on sexual [[stereotype]]s and [[double entendre]]s&nbsp;\u2013 e.g., Mrs Slocombe discussing her cat: \"Animals are very psychic...the least sign of danger and my [[Pussy#Female genitalia|pussy]]'s hair stands on end\".\n\nJohn Inman's portrayal of Humphries' over-the-top antics and sharp-tongued, witty responses, along with his trademark [[catch-phrase]] \"I'm free!\", were enthusiastically embraced by many audience members, and the character evolved into a [[gay icon]] in popular culture.  Despite this, Inman pointed out that Mr Humphries' true sexual orientation was never explicitly stated in the series, and David Croft said in an interview that the character was not homosexual, but \"just a mother's boy\".<ref>{{cite news|title=I'm Free! \u2013 The Complete ''Are You Being Served?''|publisher=Orion Books|year=1999}}</ref> In an episode of the spin-off ''[[Grace & Favour]]'', the character is further described as neither a \"woman's man\" nor a \"man's man\" and as being \"in limbo\".\n\nThe characters (Mr Humphries especially) sometimes broke the [[fourth wall]] for comical effect.\n\n==Merchandise==\nSeven early episodes were novelised for a book, written by Jeremy Lloyd, called ''Are You Being Served? \u2013 Camping in and other Fiascos''. This was written in 1976, and republished in 1997 by ''KQED Books''. The seven episodes featured are \"Camping In\", \"Up Captain Peacock\", \"Wedding Bells\", \"His and Hers\", \"Coffee Morning\", \"The Hand of Fate\" and \"The Clock\".\n\nIn 1995, KQED Books published ''Are You Being Served \u2013 The Inside Story'' by [[Adrian Rigelsford]], Anthony Brown, and Geoff Tibbals, with a foreword by Jeremy Lloyd, and sub-titled: ''The Inside Story of Britain's Funniest \u2013 and Public Television's Favorite \u2013 Comedy Series''. In 212 pages, the book's six chapters cover: The Cast of Characters, Behind the Scenes, The Episodes, The Spin-offs, Trivia Quiz, and Glossary. {{ISBN|0-912333-04-9}}.\n\nIn 1999, ''I'm Free! The Complete Are You Being Served?'', a guide to the series, was published by [[Orion Books]]. It was written by Richard Webber, with contributions from David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd.\n\nA board game was also produced in the 1970s.  Players moved round a board resembling the shop floor to purchase one item from each of the four counters and leave the store, before their opponents and without going over budget.\n\n===DVD releases===\nAll ten series, including a black and white version of the pilot episode, and all five Christmas specials from those years, as well as both series of ''Grace & Favour'' are now available on DVD in the UK (Region 2). ''Are You Being Served?: the Movie'' was released in 2002. A colour-restored version of the original pilot episode has yet to be released commercially.\n\nAll ten series, as well as both series of ''Grace & Favour'' (in packaging titled ''Are You Being Served? Again!'') and the film are available on DVD in Region 1 (North America).\n\nAll ten series, as well as both series of ''Grace & Favour'' and the film have been released in Australia (Region 4).\n\nA DVD titled ''Are You Being Served? \u2013 Best of The Early Years'' and ''Are You Being Served?

It was disbanded by being redesignated '''No.6 (P)AFU''' (Pilot-Advanced Flying Unit) on 22 April 1942.<ref>http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/ww2/airfields/airfield.php?pid=1790</ref>\n\nFrom 30 April 1946, 6 FTS was based at [[RAF Ternhill]]<ref>http://www.rafweb.org/Stations/Stations-T.htm</ref> equipped with [[North American Harvard]]s, receiving [[Percival Prentice]]s in late 1948; from July 1953 [[Percival Provost]] T1 piston engine training aircraft replaced both types.<ref>Sturtivant, 1997, p. 153</ref> On 24 July 1961 the school moved out to [[RAF Acklington]] where it closed again on 30 June 1968.<ref>http://www.jetprovostfile.org/operating-units/</ref>\n\n[[File:Hunting Jet Provost T5 XW309 V.6 FINN 30.07.77 edited-3.jpg|thumb|left|Operational Jet Provost T.5 of No.6 Flying Training School in 1977]]\nThe School reformed on 1 May 1970 at [[RAF Finningley]], within [[No. 23 Group RAF]] as an Air Navigation School (ANS). This was an amalgamation of the [[British Aerospace 125|Hawker Siddeley Dominie]] T.1 s of No.1 ANS from [[RAF Stradishall]] and the Varsities of No.2 ANS from [[RAF Gaydon]]. Low-level navigation training took place on the [[BAC Jet Provost|Jet Provost]] from August 1970, eventually using the T5B variant which had extra fuel capacity in the form of wingtip tanks due to the extra fuel burn at low level. This part of the school was known as the '''Low Level and Air Defence Training Squadron''' (LLADTS). The [[Vickers Varsity]] was phased out in 1976, making No.6 FTS an all-jet school.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s all the RAF's Colleges and Flying Training Schools had their own Jet Provost aerobatics team. One of the less known and publicised display teams was flown by 6 FTS. They flew a team for five seasons between 1962 and 1966 and it was unofficially christened the \"Cocks O'the North\".<ref>http://www.jetprovostheaven.com/jpteams/</ref>\n\nOn 14 August 1993, the LLADTS made its final farewell to the Jet Provost in the navigation training role when four aircraft staged a \"dying swan\" formation over the airfield.\n\n6 FTS also played host to the '''Multi-engine Training Squadron''' (METS) and was responsible for Operational Navigation training of all RAF multi-engine pilots, using twin-turboprop [[Handley Page Jetstream]] T1 aircraft. METS was granted the [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|No. 45 (R) Squadron]] number plate in July 1992 before leaving 6 FTS and moving to [[No. 3 Flying Training School RAF|3 FTS]] at [[RAF Cranwell]] in October 1995.\n\nThe school was disbanded on 31 March 1996 with the closure of [[RAF Finningley]].\n\n===Reformation===\nOn 7 September 2015, 6 FTS was reborn, to command and manage the [[University Air Squadron]]s and their associated [[Air Experience Flight]]s located across the UK. This role was transferred from 3 FTS due to the implementation of the [[Military Flying Training System]]. The Elementary Flying Training (EFT) in the Royal Air Force and the other services upgraded to the [[Grob G 120TP]] in 2017, while the University Air Squadrons and Air Experience Flights will remain on the Tutor T.1.<ref>{{cite web|title=6 Flying Training School|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/6-flying-training-school-08102015|website=raf.mod.uk|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe task of 6 FTS is also to ensure continual recruitment of UAS cadets into the Royal Air Force proper; those who do not join will have a better appreciation for the military, which they will take forward into their careers.\n\n==Current units==\n{{Location map+|UK|float=right|relief=1|width=300|caption='''University Air Squadrons & Air Experience Flight bases'''|places=\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=54.655|long=-6.227|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=left|label='''[[JHFS Aldergrove]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=52.645|long=-2.255556|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=left|label='''[[RAF Cosford]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.441111|long=-2.2825|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=top|label=[[RAF Colerne|'''Colerne''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=52.6125|long=-0.476389|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=bottom|label='''[[RAF Wittering]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=53.030278|long=-0.483333|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label='''[[RAF Cranwell]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=56.373056|long=-2.868611|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label=[[Leuchars Station|'''Leuchars''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=55.871944|long=-4.433056|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=bottom|label='''[[Glasgow Airport]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=53.581667|long=-3.05556|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=top|label='''[[RAF Woodvale]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=54.2925|long=-1.535556|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=top|label='''[[RAF Leeming]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.616389|long=-1.095833|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label='''[[RAF Benson]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.152222|long=-1.7475|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=bottom|label=[[MoD Boscombe Down|'''Boscombe Down''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.404722|long=-3.435833|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=left|label=[[MoD St Athan|'''St Athan''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=54.048889|long=-1.252778|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label='''[[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]'''}}\n}}\n\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n'''[[RAF Cosford]]'''\n*[[University of Birmingham Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 8 Air Experience Flight RAF|8 AEF]]\n'''[[Colerne Airfield]]'''\n*Bristol University Air Squadron\n*[[No. 3 Air Experience Flight RAF|3 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Wittering]]'''\n*[[No. 115 Squadron RAF]]\n*[[Cambridge University Air Squadron]]\n*[[University of London Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 5 Air Experience Flight RAF|5 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF College Cranwell]]'''\n*East Midlands Universities Air Squadron\n*[[No. 7 Air Experience Flight RAF|7 AEF]]\n'''[[Leuchars Station]]'''\n*[[East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 12 Air Experience Flight RAF|12 AEF]]\n'''[[Glasgow International Airport]]'''\n*[[Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 4 Air Experience Flight RAF|4 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Woodvale]]'''\n*[[Liverpool University Air Squadron]]\n*Manchester and Salford Universities Air Squadron\n*[[No. 10 Air Experience Flight RAF|10 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Leeming]]'''\n*[[Northumbrian Universities Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 11 Air Experience Flight RAF|11 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Benson]]'''\n*[[Oxford University Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 6 Air Experience Flight RAF|6 AEF]]\n'''[[MoD Boscombe Down]]'''\n*[[Southampton University Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 2 Air Experience Flight RAF|2 AEF]]\n'''[[MoD St Athan]]'''\n*University of Wales Air Squadron\n*[[No. 1 Air Experience Flight RAF|1 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]'''\n*Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron\n*[[No. 9 Air Experience Flight RAF|9 AEF]]\n'''[[JHFS Aldergrove]]'''\n*[[Northern Ireland Universities Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 14 Air Experience Flight RAF|13 AEF]]\n{{colend}}\n\nWith the reduction in the gliding fleet, MoD have announced they intend to create No.s 13 and 14 AEFs.

This was an amalgamation of the [[British Aerospace 125|Hawker Siddeley Dominie]] T.1 s of No.1 ANS from [[RAF Stradishall]] and the Varsities of No.2 ANS from [[RAF Gaydon]]. Low-level navigation training took place on the [[BAC Jet Provost|Jet Provost]] from August 1970, eventually using the T5B variant which had extra fuel capacity in the form of wingtip tanks due to the extra fuel burn at low level. This part of the school was known as the '''Low Level and Air Defence Training Squadron''' (LLADTS). The [[Vickers Varsity]] was phased out in 1976, making No.6 FTS an all-jet school.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s all the RAF's Colleges and Flying Training Schools had their own Jet Provost aerobatics team. One of the less known and publicised display teams was flown by 6 FTS. They flew a team for five seasons between 1962 and 1966 and it was unofficially christened the \"Cocks O'the North\".<ref>http://www.jetprovostheaven.com/jpteams/</ref>\n\nOn 14 August 1993, the LLADTS made its final farewell to the Jet Provost in the navigation training role when four aircraft staged a \"dying swan\" formation over the airfield.\n\n6 FTS also played host to the '''Multi-engine Training Squadron''' (METS) and was responsible for Operational Navigation training of all RAF multi-engine pilots, using twin-turboprop [[Handley Page Jetstream]] T1 aircraft. METS was granted the [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|No. 45 (R) Squadron]] number plate in July 1992 before leaving 6 FTS and moving to [[No. 3 Flying Training School RAF|3 FTS]] at [[RAF Cranwell]] in October 1995.\n\nThe school was disbanded on 31 March 1996 with the closure of [[RAF Finningley]].\n\n===Reformation===\nOn 7 September 2015, 6 FTS was reborn, to command and manage the [[University Air Squadron|University Air Squadrons]] and their associated [[Air Experience Flight|Air Experience Flights]] located across the UK. This role was transferred from 3 FTS due to the implementation of the [[Military Flying Training System]]. The Elementary Flying Training (EFT) in the Royal Air Force and the other services upgraded to the [[Grob G 120TP]] in 2017, while the University Air Squadrons and Air Experience Flights will remain on the Tutor T.1.<ref>{{cite web|title=6 Flying Training School|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/6-flying-training-school-08102015|website=raf.mod.uk|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe task of 6 FTS is also to ensure continual recruitment of UAS cadets into the Royal Air Force proper; those who do not join will have a better appreciation for the military, which they will take forward into their careers.\n\n==Current units==\n{{Location map+|UK|float=right|relief=1|width=300|caption='''University Air Squadrons & Air Experience Flight bases'''|places=\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=54.655|long=-6.227|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=left|label='''[[JHFS Aldergrove]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=52.645|long=-2.255556|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=left|label='''[[RAF Cosford]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.441111|long=-2.2825|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=top|label=[[RAF Colerne|'''Colerne''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=52.6125|long=-0.476389|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=bottom|label='''[[RAF Wittering]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=53.030278|long=-0.483333|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label='''[[RAF Cranwell]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=56.373056|long=-2.868611|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label=[[Leuchars Station|'''Leuchars''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=55.871944|long=-4.433056|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=bottom|label='''[[Glasgow Airport]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=53.581667|long=-3.05556|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=top|label='''[[RAF Woodvale]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=54.2925|long=-1.535556|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=top|label='''[[RAF Leeming]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.616389|long=-1.095833|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label='''[[RAF Benson]]'''}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.152222|long=-1.7475|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=bottom|label=[[MoD Boscombe Down|'''Boscombe Down''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=51.404722|long=-3.435833|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=left|label=[[MoD St Athan|'''St Athan''']]}}\n{{Location map~|UK|lat=54.048889|long=-1.252778|mark=RAF roundel.svg|position=right|label='''[[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]'''}}\n}}\n\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n'''[[RAF Cosford]]'''\n*[[University of Birmingham Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 8 Air Experience Flight RAF|8 AEF]]\n'''[[Colerne Airfield]]'''\n*Bristol University Air Squadron\n*[[No. 3 Air Experience Flight RAF|3 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Wittering]]'''\n*[[No. 115 Squadron RAF]]\n*[[Cambridge University Air Squadron]]\n*[[University of London Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 5 Air Experience Flight RAF|5 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF College Cranwell]]'''\n*East Midlands Universities Air Squadron\n*[[No. 7 Air Experience Flight RAF|7 AEF]]\n'''[[Leuchars Station]]'''\n*[[East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 12 Air Experience Flight RAF|12 AEF]]\n'''[[Glasgow International Airport]]'''\n*[[Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 4 Air Experience Flight RAF|4 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Woodvale]]'''\n*[[Liverpool University Air Squadron]]\n*Manchester and Salford Universities Air Squadron\n*[[No. 10 Air Experience Flight RAF|10 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Leeming]]'''\n*[[Northumbrian Universities Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 11 Air Experience Flight RAF|11 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Benson]]'''\n*[[Oxford University Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 6 Air Experience Flight RAF|6 AEF]]\n'''[[MoD Boscombe Down]]'''\n*[[Southampton University Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 2 Air Experience Flight RAF|2 AEF]]\n'''[[MoD St Athan]]'''\n*University of Wales Air Squadron\n*[[No. 1 Air Experience Flight RAF|1 AEF]]\n'''[[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]'''\n*Yorkshire Universities Air Squadron\n*[[No. 9 Air Experience Flight RAF|9 AEF]]\n'''[[JHFS Aldergrove]]'''\n*[[Northern Ireland Universities Air Squadron]]\n*[[No. 14 Air Experience Flight RAF|13 AEF]]\n{{colend}}\n\nWith the reduction in the gliding fleet, MoD have announced they intend to create No.s 13 and 14 AEFs.
