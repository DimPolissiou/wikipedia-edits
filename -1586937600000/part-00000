He is best known as the captain of [[Japanese submarine I-58 (1943)|Japanese submarine ''I-58'']], which sank {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} in 1945 after its delivery of bomb parts for the first atomic weapon used in wartime, ''[[Little Boy]]'', but prior to the attack on [[Hiroshima]].\n\nBorn in [[Kyoto]] and educated at the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]], Hashimoto volunteered for service in submarines and was later aboard [[Japanese submarine I-24 (1939)|submarine ''I-24'']] during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941. Hashimoto commanded coastal patrol and training submarines off Japan for much of the war, and in 1944 took command of ''I-58'', a ship which was equipped to carry ''[[kaiten]]'', or manned torpedoes. After a number of unsuccessful operations, under the command of Hashimoto ''I-58'' sank ''Indianapolis'' on 30 July with two [[Type 95 torpedo]]es while on a midnight patrol. He lost his entire family in the ''Little Boy'' [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] days after the sinking of ''Indianapolis''.<ref>http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2016/07/uss_indianapolis_survivor_youv.html</ref>\n\nHashimoto's submarine then returned to Japan, one of the few such ships to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution at the [[court-martial]] of [[Charles B. McVay III]], the commanding officer of ''Indianapolis'', a move which was controversial at the time. He was later part of an effort to exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a [[Shinto]] priest. He died in 2000, five days before the exoneration of McVay\n\n==Early life==\nMochitsura Hashimoto was born in 1909 in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=213}} the eighth of nine children and fifth son of a ''[[kannushi]]'' ([[Shinto]] priest). He attended [[Kyoto Third High School]], a prestigious school, where he performed well.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=1}} In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]]. The family did not have a naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] and was commissioned into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Hashimoto graduated from high school in 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving home for the first time, Hashimoto then attended the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] at [[Etajima, Hiroshima|Etajima]] for four years, studying [[Japanese history]], engineering, and naval tactics, as well as [[judo]] and other military athletics.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=2}} He graduated and [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] in 1931.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=343}}\n\nIn 1937, Hashimoto married Nobuko Miki, the daughter of a successful [[Osaka]] businessman.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=2}} The couple had three sons; Mochihiro, born in 1940,{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=3}} Nobutake, born in 1942, and Tomoyuki, born in 1944;{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=4}}and Sonoe, a daughter born in 1947.\n\n== Military career ==\nIn 1934, Hashimoto volunteered for the [[submarine]] service,{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=213}} and in 1937, he served aboard [[destroyer]]s and [[submarine chaser]]s off the shores of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].

She remained in port there until March, likely due to supply shortages. On 1 March, she was ordered to [[Iwo Jima]] to support the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|battle taking place there]]. Once there, ''I-58'' was ordered to launch all of its ''kaitens'' without their pilots and immediately return home.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=8\u20139}} She was ordered out again on 2 April sailing to support Japanese forces at the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. While there, she was attacked by aircraft 50 times. She never surfaced for more than a few hours. She limped to Kure on 29 April 1945, the only Japanese submarine to withdraw from the operation. She remained in port because of continued [[naval mine|mining]] conducted by [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and departed on 16 July on another war patrol. At the time, she was one of only four large submarines left in the Japanese Navy, and her mission was to harass [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines of communications.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Stanton|2002|p=79}}{{sfn|Boyd|Yoshida|2002|p=179}}\n\nPassing through the Inland Sea around minefields, ''I-58'' headed for the east coast of [[The Philippines]] intending to attack ships there.

On 9 August she launched two ''kaitens'' against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining ''kaitens'' and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. ''I-58'' surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the ''[[Gyokuon-h\u014ds\u014d]]'' signaling the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] and end of the war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew of the end of the war.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=168}} After the war, it was confirmed ''Indianapolis'' was the only ship ''I-58'' had sunk.{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=213}} It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II.{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=215}} When Hashimoto came home from the war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]] on 7 August.\n\n=== McVay court-martial ===\n[[File:USS Indianapolis (CA-35) off the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 10 July 1945 (19-N-86911).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} in 1945]]\nThree days after Japan's formal surrender in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto was promoted to his final rank of [[commander]].<ref>Naval appointment dated 11 September 1945, Publication No. 1908, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072108400 (jp)</ref> On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Yukikaze (1939)|''Yukikaze'']], among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas.<ref>Naval appointment dated 29 November 1945, Publication No. 1994, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072147800 (jp)</ref> Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the [[United States military]] to be a witness for the prosecution in the [[court-martial]] against ''Indianapolis'' commander [[Captain (naval rank)|Captain]] [[Charles B.

Hashimoto commanded coastal patrol and training submarines off Japan for much of the war, and in 1944 took command of ''I-58'', a ship which was equipped to carry ''[[kaiten]]'', or manned torpedoes. After a number of unsuccessful operations, under the command of Hashimoto ''I-58'' sank ''Indianapolis'' on 30 July with two [[Type 95 torpedo]]es while on a midnight patrol. He lost his entire family in the ''Little Boy'' [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] days after the sinking of ''Indianapolis''.<ref>http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2016/07/uss_indianapolis_survivor_youv.html</ref>\n\nHashimoto's submarine then returned to Japan, one of the few such ships to survive the war. Hashimoto was called to testify on behalf of the prosecution at the [[court-martial]] of [[Charles B. McVay III]], the commanding officer of ''Indianapolis'', a move which was controversial at the time. He was later part of an effort to exonerate McVay, which was eventually successful. Hashimoto later became a [[Shinto]] priest. He died in 2000.\n\n==Early life==\nMochitsura Hashimoto was born in 1909 in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=213}} the eighth of nine children and fifth son of a ''[[kannushi]]'' ([[Shinto]] priest). He attended [[Kyoto Third High School]], a prestigious school, where he performed well.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=1}} In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]]. The family did not have a naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them.

Hashimoto oversaw much of the construction of ''I-58''. The submarine was later overhauled mid-construction to carry ''[[Kaiten]]'' manned [[torpedo]]es, which was considered a great honor by Hashimoto's crew.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=5}} ''I-58'' was commissioned on 13 September 1944 and Hashimoto commanded her during her [[shakedown cruise]]s, commanding his men on repeated drills without [[shore leave]].{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Harrell|2005|p=66}} He completed training on the submarine in December 1944.

She arrived off the coast of [[Guam]] at 03:00 on 11 January 1945 and Hashimoto ordered four ''kaitens'' launched. The kaitens tentatively claimed a [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] sunk, though it was unable to verify if the ship had actually been struck.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=8\u20139}} The strike had been unsuccessful.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=344}} She then sped back to Kure and arrived there on 20 January. She remained in port there until March, likely due to supply shortages. On 1 March, she was ordered to [[Iwo Jima]] to support the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|battle taking place there]]. Once there, ''I-58'' was ordered to launch all of its ''kaitens'' without their pilots and immediately return home.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=8\u20139}} She was ordered out again on 2 April sailing to support Japanese forces at the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. While there, she was attacked by aircraft 50 times. She never surfaced for more than a few hours. She limped to Kure on 29 April 1945, the only Japanese submarine to withdraw from the operation. She remained in port because of continued [[naval mine|mining]] conducted by [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and departed on 16 July on another war patrol. At the time, she was one of only four large submarines left in the Japanese Navy, and her mission was to harass [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines of communications.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Stanton|2002|p=79}}{{sfn|Boyd|Yoshida|2002|p=179}}\n\nPassing through the Inland Sea around minefields, ''I-58'' headed for the east coast of [[The Philippines]] intending to attack ships there.

She heard explosions at 15:21 and 15:31 but her crew was unable to determine if the ''kaitens'' had struck their targets. Hashimoto reported a tanker assumed sunk.\n\n=== Sinking of ''Indianapolis''===\nOn 29 July, Lt. Cmdr. Hashimoto ordered the submarine to make for an area where he believed shipping lanes between Guam, Leyte, [[Peleliu]] and Okinawa intersected.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=58\u201359}} At 23:35 that evening, Hashimoto spotted the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}} at {{convert|10,000|m}} cruising for his position at medium speed.{{sfn|Stanton|2002|pp=93\u201395}} Believing the ship to be an [[USS Idaho (BB-42)|\"''Idaho''-class\" battleship]], he ordered ''I-58'' to dive and once ''Indianapolis'' closed to {{convert|1,500|m}} he ordered six regular torpedoes fired at 00:02 on 30 July.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Stanton|2002|p=100\u2013101}} Spotting three explosions strike the ''Indianapolis'', Hashimoto ordered the submarine on a deep dive fearing detection.

After searching unsuccessfully for [[flotsam]] or any sign of the ship,{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=375}} he ordered the ''I-58'' to retire at 02:30.

She had two turrets aft and a large tower mast. I took her to be an ''Idaho''-class battleship. The crew were all agog, awaiting the order to fire the torpedoes.

The torpedo-release switch pressed at intervals of two seconds and then the report came from the torpedo room, \"All tubes fired and correct.\" Six torpedoes were speeding, fanwise, toward the enemy ship.&nbsp;... Bringing the boat on to a course parallel with the enemy, we waited anxiously. Every minute seemed an age. Then on the starboard side of the enemy by the forward turret, and then the after turret there rose columns of water to be followed immediately by flashes of bright red flame. Then another column of water arose from alongside the Number 2 turret and seemed to envelop the whole ship\u2014\"A hit, a hit!\" I shouted as each torpedo struck home, and the crew danced for joy.{{sfn|Harrell|2005|p=68\u201371}} }}\n\nHashimoto ordered ''I-58'' northward looking for additional ships to attack.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=119}} She picked up reports of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] in intercepted radio transmissions on 7 August but Hashimoto continued to hunt for Allied ships south of [[Bungo Strait]]. On 9 August she launched two ''kaitens'' against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining ''kaitens'' and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. ''I-58'' surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the ''[[Gyokuon-h\u014ds\u014d]]'' signaling the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] and end of the war. She traveled up the Inland Sea and arrived at Hirao where Hashimoto emotionally informed his crew of the end of the war.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=168}} After the war, it was confirmed ''Indianapolis'' was the only ship ''I-58'' had sunk.{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=213}} It was the last Japanese naval success of World War II.{{sfn|Fredriksen|2001|p=215}} When Hashimoto came home from the war, he learned that his entire family had been killed in the atomic bombing of [[Hiroshima]] on 7 August.\n\n=== McVay court-martial ===\n[[File:USS Indianapolis (CA-35) off the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 10 July 1945 (19-N-86911).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} in 1945]]\nThree days after Japan's formal surrender in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto was promoted to his final rank of [[commander]].<ref>Naval appointment dated 11 September 1945, Publication No. 1908, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072108400 (jp)</ref> On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Yukikaze (1939)|''Yukikaze'']], among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas.<ref>Naval appointment dated 29 November 1945, Publication No. 1994, Japan Center for Asian Historical Records, reference code C13072147800 (jp)</ref> Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the [[United States military]] to be a witness for the prosecution in the [[court-martial]] against ''Indianapolis'' commander [[Captain (naval rank)|Captain]] [[Charles B.

Hashimoto was assured he would be treated as a naval officer instead of a [[prisoner of war]] or [[war criminal]], but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front-page news that day in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and in other newspapers. The next day he arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]] where hearings were taking place.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=213\u2013214}} For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke through translator Francis Earl Eastlake from the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]].{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=224}}\n\nHashimoto spoke first with [[judge advocate]] Captain [[Thomas J. Ryan (admiral)|Thomas J. Ryan]] for four hours on 11 December. He spoke the next day with Captain John P. Cady, McVay's chief defense counsel, for several hours, as both officers sought to determine his credibility and competence to take the stand in the trial. He told them the visibility was good on the night of the attack and he had been able to easily spot the ''Indianapolis''. Hashimoto testified in the court on 13 December in a crowded courtroom.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|pp=221\u2013222}} It was the first time that an officer of a nation at war with the United States had testified against an officer of the U.S. Navy in a court martial.{{sfn|Newcomb|2000|p=223}}{{#tag:ref|Historian [[Richard Newcomb]] noted that commanding officers of two [[Continental Navy]] ships were tried and acquitted for the loss of their ships during the [[American Revolutionary War]]: [[John Manley (naval officer)|John Manley]] of [[USS Hancock (1776)|USS ''Hancock'']] and Elisha Hinman of [[USS Alfred (1774)|USS ''Alfred'']].

King Brihadbana was the grandson of Mahabali. Last known ruling king of this generation was King Sambayya under Nolamba Lordship.They were in constant conflicts with Nolambas and Western Gangas of the Kolar region. They had Vaidumbas as their allies. They had the present day Avani region (a small village in Kolar District) as their capital.\n\nThey had a black flag and a bull crest as their emblem. An inscription of the period 339 AD found in Mulbagal Taluk describes all in Sanskrit and begins with the praise of Shiva whose throne is said to be on the lofty peak of the mountain called Nandi, obviously the present Nandidurga, a hill considered to be the personification of Nandi, the bull of Shiva. The inscription records the grant of the village Mudiyanur (also callled Chudagrama, a Sanskritised forw of Mudiyanur) to 25 Brahmins by Vadhuvallabha-Malladeva- Nandivarma, son of Vijayaditya Deva and grandson of Nandi- varma,, a promoter of Mahabali's dynasty. The king, who was in the town of Avanya (Avani), is said to have made the Bana dynasty prosperous and has been compared with Bodhisatva.\n\nThe Banas seem to have been a strong power almost upto the Decline of end of the 9th century. In the battle of Soremati about 874, Banas they, together with the Vaidumbas, are said to have defeated the Gangas and the Nolambas. Further, their inscriptions of 898, 905 and 909 A.D. mention no overlord. But all the same, the Banas had adversaries on all sides, and their power was continually being undermined since the close of the 9th century. They ultimately appear to have lost their independence by the first half of the lOth century at the latest.. If the Nolamba king Mahendra (c. 870-897) is described as the destroyer of the Mahabali family, the Chola king Viranarayana or Parantaka claims in 921 to have uprooted by force two Bana kings and con- ferred the title of Banadhiraja on the Ganga prince Prithvipathi II, who helped him in this task. In 961, which is the date of the latest Bana inscription in this district, we find one King Sambayya ruling a small district under the Pallava king Iriva Nolamba or Dilipa. But the Banas did not disappear altogether from the political history, as is evident from the references to them in some later literary works and inscriptions. Stray Bana records have been found outside this district, particularly in the south, upto as late as the first quarter of the 16th century A.D. The history of the Banas, who, during a period of more than a thousand years, moved from district to district, from the Andhra-desha in the north to the Pandya country in the far south where they were governors of Madurai under the Vijayanagara kings, is particularly interesting in that it illustrates the long survival of a dynasty by migrations.\n\n==Hindu mythologies==\nMahabali is described in early Hindu mythologies as a benevolent and generous king, but violent and surrounded by ''asura'' associates who abused power. They particularly persecuted the ''suras'' and the Brahmins.<ref name=\"Dalal2010p229\">{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=229\u2013230}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC|year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6|pages=214\u2013215}}</ref><ref name =Narayan/> Mahabali also temporarily possessed the ''amrita'' (nectar for eternal life) obtained by the ''asuras'' by trickery.<ref name=\"Hudson2008p163\"/> The amrita allowed his associates to bring him back to life after his death in one of the wars between ''suras'' and ''asuras''.<ref name=\"Williams2008p73\"/><ref name=\"Hudson2008p163\"/> Mahabali was, thus, immune from death.

King Brihadbana was the grandson of Mahabali. Last known ruling king of this generation was King Sambayya under Nolamba Lordship.They were in constant conflicts with Nolambas and Western Gangas of the Kolar region. They had Vaidumbas as their allies. They had the present day Avani region (a small village in Kolar District) as their capital.\n\nThey had a black flag and a bull crest as their emblem. An inscription of the period 339 AD found in Mulbagal Taluk describes all in Sanskrit and begins with the praise of Shiva whose throne is said to be on the lofty peak of the mountain called Nandi, obviously the present Nandidurga, a hill considered to be the personification of Nandi, the bull of Shiva. The inscription records the grant of the village Mudiyanur (also callled Chudagrama, a Sanskritised forw of Mudiyanur) to 25 Brahmins by Vadhuvallabha-Malladeva- Nandivarma, son of Vijayaditya Deva and grandson of Nandi- varma,, a promoter of Mahabali's dynasty. The king, who was in the town of Avanya (Avani), is said to have made the Bana dynasty prosperous and has been compared with Bodhisatva.\n\nThe Banas seem to have been a strong power almost upto the Decline of end of the 9th century. In the battle of Soremati about 874, Banas they, together with the Vaidumbas, are said to have defeated the Gangas and the Nolambas. Further, their inscriptions of 898, 905 and 909 A.D. mention no overlord. But all the same, the Banas had adversaries on all sides, and their power was continually being undermined since the close of the 9th century. They ultimately appear to have lost their independence by the first half of the lOth century at the latest.. If the Nolamba king Mahendra (c. 870-897) is described as the destroyer of the Mahabali family, the Chola king Viranarayana or Parantaka claims in 921 to have uprooted by force two Bana kings and con- ferred the title of Banadhiraja on the Ganga prince Prithvipathi II, who helped him in this task. In 961, which is the date of the latest Bana inscription in this district, we find one King Sambayya ruling a small district under the Pallava king Iriva Nolamba or Dilipa. But the Banas did not disappear altogether from the political history, as is evident from the references to them in some later literary works and inscriptions. Stray Bana records have been found outside this district, particularly in the south, upto as late as the first quarter of the 16th century A.D. The history of the Banas, who, during a period of more than a thousand years, moved from district to district, from the Andhra-desha in the north to the Pandya country in the far south where they were governors of Madurai under the Vijayanagara kings, is particularly interesting in that it illustrates the long survival of a dynasty by migrations.\n\n==Hindu mythologies==\nMahabali is described in early Hindu mythologies as a benevolent and generous king, but violent and surrounded by ''asura'' associates who abused power. They particularly persecuted the ''suras'' and the Brahmins.<ref name=\"Dalal2010p229\">{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=229\u2013230}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC|year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6|pages=214\u2013215}}</ref><ref name =Narayan/> Mahabali also temporarily possessed the ''amrita'' (nectar for eternal life) obtained by the ''asuras'' by trickery.<ref name=\"Hudson2008p163\"/> The amrita allowed his associates to bring him back to life after his death in one of the wars between ''suras'' and ''asuras''.<ref name=\"Williams2008p73\"/><ref name=\"Hudson2008p163\"/> Mahabali was, thus, immune from death.

As in the original novel, the story features evil [[Witchcraft|witches]] who masquerade as ordinary women and kill children, and a boy and his grandmother need to find a way to foil and destroy them.\n\nThe film was produced by [[The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Productions]] for [[Lorimar Productions|Lorimar Film Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] as the last theatrical film to be produced by Lorimar, before the company shut down in 1993. The film was very well received by critics, but [[Box office bomb|performed poorly at the box office]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a vacation with his grandmother Helga in [[Norway]], eight-year-old American boy Luke Eveshim is warned about [[Witchcraft|witches]], female demons with a boundless hatred for children and who use various methods of destroying or transforming them. Helga tells Luke how to tell a witch from an ordinary woman: real witches have claws instead of fingernails which they hide by wearing gloves, are bald which they hide by wearing wigs that give them rashes, have square feet with no toes which they hide by wearing plain shoes, have blue spit which they use for ink, have a purple tinge in their pupils and have large nostrils which they use to sniff out children; to a witch, children stink of dog's droppings. Helga says her childhood friend Erica fell victim to a witch and was cursed to spend the rest of her life trapped inside a painting, aging gradually until finally disappearing a few years earlier.\n\nAfter Luke's parents are killed in a car accident, Helga becomes Luke's legal guardian and they move to England. While outside, Luke is approached by a woman he quickly realizes is a witch and he escapes. On Luke's ninth birthday, Helga falls ill with diabetes. Her doctor advises they spend the summer by the sea.\n\nAt their seaside hotel,  Luke meets and befriends a gluttonous but friendly boy, Bruno Jenkins. Luke gets on the bad side of the hotel manager, Mr. Stringer, after his pet mice frighten a maid. Also at the hotel is a convention of witches, masquerading as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The [[Grand High Witch]], who is the all-powerful leader of the world's witches, is attending under the name Eva Ernst.\n\nLuke hides inside the ballroom and spies on the witches' meeting. The Grand High Witch unveils her latest creation: a magic potion to turn children into mice. They will be used on confectionery products in sweet shops and candy stores to be opened using money provided by the Grand High Witch. Bruno, who was given the potion earlier, is brought into the room. He turns into a mouse and flees.\n\nLuke is discovered and runs to Helga in their room but finds her resting after having a dizzy spell. The Grand High Witch seizes Luke and takes him back to the ballroom. He is forced to drink the potion, turning him into a mouse, though he escapes. He finds Bruno and reunites with Helga, who has since recovered.\n\nThe mouse Luke devises a plan to kill the witches by sneaking into Ernst's room to steal a bottle of the potion, then sneaking into the kitchen and put it into the soup for the special RSPCC party. He then takes it up to Helga. They first try to get Bruno to his parents, but they do not believe Helga. Mr. Jenkins calls her a witch and tells her to take the mice away upon scaring Mrs. Jenkins.\n\nMr. Jenkins also orders the soup, though Helga stops him from consuming it. The Jenkins finally realise that Bruno was turned into a mouse when he says hello to them. As the witches enter the dining room, Miss Irvine, Ernst's assistant, has become disillusioned by her mistress treating her badly and banning her from the celebration, quits, and she is spared from what is about to happen. \n\nThe formula turns all the witches into mice, and the staff and hotel guests join in killing them, unknowingly ridding England of its witches. The Grand High Witch herself dies at the hands of Mr. Stringer, and Helga returns Bruno to his parents. Luke and Helga return home to where Ernst's trunk full of money and an address book of all witches in the United States is delivered. \n\nThat night, Miss Irvine visits and uses her power to revert Luke to his human form and return his pet mice, along with his glasses. She then leaves to repeat the process with Bruno.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as [[Grand High Witch|Miss Eva Ernst / Grand High Witch]]\n* [[Jasen Fisher]] as Luke Eveshim\n* [[Mai Zetterling]] as Helga Eveshim\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Mr. Stringer\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as Miss Susan Irvine\n* [[Charlie Potter]] as Bruno Jenkins\n* [[Anne Lambton]] as The Woman in Black\n* [[Angelique Rockas]] as Henrietta\n* [[Annabel Brooks]] as Nicola Cuttle\n* [[Sukie Smith]] as Marlene\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Mr. Jenkins\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Mrs. Jenkins\n* [[Jenny Runacre]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Emma Relph]] as Mildred\n* [[Rose English]] as Doreen\n* [[Nora Connolly]] as Beatrice\n* [[Rosamund Greenwood]] as Janice\n* [[Darcy Flynn]] as Mrs. Eveshim\n* [[Vincent Marzello]] as Mr. Eveshim\n* [[Elsie Eide]] as Erica\n* [[Grete Nordr\u00e5]] as Norwegian Witch\n* [[Ola Otnes]] as Erica's Father \n* [[Merete Armand]] as Erica's Mother \n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Andre\n* [[Roberta Taylor]] as Jacqueline (Witch Chef)\n* [[Stella Tanner]] as Witch at Meeting\n* [[Barbara Hicks]] as Regina\n* [[Ann Tirard]] as Witch at Meeting (Woman 1)\n* [[Leila Hofman]] as Witch at Meeting (Woman 2)\n* [[Wendy Lowder]] as Witch at Meeting\n* [[Brian Hawksley]] as Elderly Waiter\n* [[Michael Palin]] as Witch at Meeting (Uncredited) (Many of the witches at the meeting are men in women's clothing.)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==.\n''The Witches'' was adapted from the children's [[The Witches (book)|book of the same title]] by British author [[Roald Dahl]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Bewitched, Bothered, Buried Under Latex|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/ca-1212_1_anjelica-huston|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref> It was the final film that [[Jim Henson]] personally worked on before his death, the final theatrical film produced by [[Lorimar Productions]], and the last film made based on Dahl's material before his death (both Henson and Dahl died that year).\n\nThe following people did special puppeteer work in this film: Anthony Asbury, [[Don Austen]] (Bruno's mouse form), Sue Dacre, [[David Greenaway]], [[Brian Henson]], Robert Tygner, and [[Steve Whitmire|Steven Whitmire]] (Luke's mouse form).

As a gesture of conciliation, Roeg offered to film two versions before he made his final choice: the book version where Luke remains a mouse, and the happier version where he is transformed back into a human. Upon watching the scene loyal to his book, Dahl was so moved that he was brought to tears.\n\nHowever, Roeg decided to go with the changed ending, which led Dahl to demand that his name be removed entirely from the credits, and to threaten a publicity campaign against the film.

As in the original novel, the story features evil [[Witchcraft|witches]] who masquerade as ordinary women and kill children, and a boy and his grandmother need to find a way to foil and destroy them.\n\nThe film was produced by [[The Jim Henson Company|Jim Henson Productions]] for [[Lorimar Productions|Lorimar Film Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] as the last theatrical film to be produced by Lorimar, before the company shut down in 1993. The film was very well received by critics, but [[Box office bomb|performed poorly at the box office]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a vacation with his grandmother Helga in [[Norway]], eight-year-old American boy Luke Eveshim is warned about [[Witchcraft|witches]], female demons with a boundless hatred for children and who use various methods of destroying or transforming them. Helga tells Luke how to tell a witch from an ordinary woman: real witches have claws instead of fingernails which they hide by wearing gloves, are bald which they hide by wearing wigs that give them rashes, have square feet with no toes which they hide by wearing plain shoes, have blue spit which they use for ink, have a purple tinge in their pupils and have large nostrils which they use to sniff out children; to a witch, children stink of dog's droppings. Helga says her childhood friend Erica fell victim to a witch and was cursed to spend the rest of her life trapped inside a painting, aging gradually until finally disappearing a few years earlier.\n\nAfter Luke's parents are killed in a car accident, Helga becomes Luke's legal guardian and they move to England. While outside, Luke is approached by a woman he quickly realizes is a witch and he escapes. On Luke's ninth birthday, Helga falls ill with diabetes. Her doctor advises they spend the summer by the sea.\n\nAt their seaside hotel,  Luke meets and befriends a gluttonous but friendly boy, Bruno Jenkins. Luke gets on the bad side of the hotel manager, Mr. Stringer, after his pet mice frighten a maid. Also at the hotel is a convention of witches, masquerading as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The [[Grand High Witch]], who is the all-powerful leader of the world's witches, is attending under the name Eva Ernst.\n\nLuke hides inside the ballroom and spies on the witches' meeting. The Grand High Witch unveils her latest creation: a magic potion to turn children into mice. They will be used on confectionery products in sweet shops and candy stores to be opened using money provided by the Grand High Witch. Bruno, who was given the potion earlier, is brought into the room. He turns into a mouse and flees.\n\nLuke is discovered and runs to Helga in their room but finds her resting after having a dizzy spell. The Grand High Witch seizes Luke and takes him back to the ballroom. He is forced to drink the potion, turning him into a mouse, though he escapes. He finds Bruno and reunites with Helga, who has since recovered.\n\nThe mouse Luke devises a plan to kill the witches by sneaking into Ernst's room to steal a bottle of the potion, then sneaking into the kitchen and put it into the soup for the special RSPCC party. He then takes it up to Helga. They first try to get Bruno to his parents, but they do not believe Helga. Mr. Jenkins calls her a witch and tells her to take the mice away upon scaring Mrs. Jenkins.\n\nMr. Jenkins also orders the soup, though Helga stops him from consuming it. The Jenkins finally realise that Bruno was turned into a mouse when he says hello to them. As the witches enter the dining room, Miss Irvine, Ernst's assistant, has become disillusioned by her mistress treating her badly and banning her from the celebration, quits, and she is spared from what is about to happen. \n\nThe formula turns all the witches into mice, and the staff and hotel guests join in killing them, unknowingly ridding England of its witches. The Grand High Witch herself dies at the hands of Mr. Stringer, and Helga returns Bruno to his parents. Luke and Helga return home to where Ernst's trunk full of money and an address book of all witches in the United States is delivered. \n\nThat night, Miss Irvine visits and uses her power to revert Luke to his human form and return his pet mice, along with his glasses. She then leaves to repeat the process with Bruno.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as [[Grand High Witch|Miss Eva Ernst / Grand High Witch]]\n* [[Jasen Fisher]] as Luke Eveshim\n* [[Mai Zetterling]] as Helga Eveshim\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Mr. Stringer\n* [[Jane Horrocks]] as Miss Susan Irvine\n* [[Charlie Potter]] as Bruno Jenkins\n* [[Anne Lambton]] as The Woman in Black\n* [[Angelique Rockas]] as Henrietta\n* [[Annabel Brooks]] as Nicola Cuttle\n* [[Sukie Smith]] as Marlene\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Mr. Jenkins\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Mrs. Jenkins\n* [[Jenny Runacre]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Emma Relph]] as Mildred\n* [[Rose English]] as Doreen\n* [[Nora Connolly]] as Beatrice\n* [[Rosamund Greenwood]] as Janice\n* [[Darcy Flynn]] as Mrs. Eveshim\n* [[Vincent Marzello]] as Mr. Eveshim\n* [[Elsie Eide]] as Erica\n* [[Grete Nordr\u00e5]] as Norwegian Witch\n* [[Ola Otnes]] as Erica's Father \n* [[Merete Armand]] as Erica's Mother \n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Andre\n* [[Roberta Taylor]] as Jacqueline (Witch Chef)\n* [[Stella Tanner]] as Witch at Meeting\n* [[Barbara Hicks]] as Regina\n* [[Ann Tirard]] as Witch at Meeting (Woman 1)\n* [[Leila Hofman]] as Witch at Meeting (Woman 2)\n* [[Wendy Lowder]] as Witch at Meeting\n* [[Brian Hawksley]] as Elderly Waiter\n* [[Michael Palin]] as Witch at Meeting (Uncredited) (Many of the witches at the meeting are men in women's clothing.)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Witches'' was adapted from the children's [[The Witches (book)|book of the same title]] by British author [[Roald Dahl]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Bewitched, Bothered, Buried Under Latex|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/ca-1212_1_anjelica-huston|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref> It was the final film that [[Jim Henson]] personally worked on before his death, the final theatrical film produced by [[Lorimar Productions]], and the last film made based on Dahl's material before his death (both Henson and Dahl died that year).\n\nThe following people did special puppeteer work in this film: Anthony Asbury, [[Don Austen]] (Bruno's mouse form), Sue Dacre, [[David Greenaway]], [[Brian Henson]], Robert Tygner, and [[Steve Whitmire|Steven Whitmire]] (Luke's mouse form).

Upon watching the scene loyal to his book, Dahl was so moved that he was brought to tears.\n\nHowever, Roeg decided to go with the changed ending, which led Dahl to demand that his name be removed entirely from the credits, and to threaten a publicity campaign against the film.

No suspects have ever been identified, although theories as to who might be responsible suggest the Soviet NKVD, as while he had initially worked with the communists despite not sharing their ideology he had broken with them under Stalin and was reportedly about to reveal evidence which would have shown that some prominent political prisoners were in fact innocent of the crimes with which they had been charged. Another theory implicates the French fascist organization [[La Cagoule]], which did not like a Jew closely advising the French government on economic matters and supposedly hoped that his death would be blamed on communist operatives, appearing to strengthen La Cagoule's claims of foreign Communists operating in France.\n* On 16 May 1937, [[Murder of Laetitia Toureaux|Laetitia Toureaux]] (29), was found fatally stabbed in an empty first-class car on the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] when it stopped at [[Porte Dor\u00e9e (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Dor\u00e9e]]. The crime received considerable media attention as not only was it the first homicide on the M\u00e9tro, Toureaux had boarded the train at the previous station, meaning the crime had to have been committed in just minutes. Further investigation found that she was leading a double life, working a factory job during the day under her own name but then at a dance hall at night under another name, and making frequent if discreet visits to the Italian embassy. Eventually it was revealed that she was a spy, infiltrating La Cagoule, who it is believed may have discovered this and killed her.

On 28 November 1940 he was surrounded with a group of young conspirators in a house in Warsaw's borough of [[Saska K\u0119pa]] and arrested by the Germans.

Sir [[Jock Delves Broughton]], another peer in Happy Valley whom Hay might have cuckolded, was acquitted after being tried with a weak case later that year; he committed suicide the following year. No other suspects have ever been named. The crime has inspired several dramatisations, most notably the 1987 film ''[[White Mischief (film)|White Mischief]]'', which have attempted to offer solutions.\n* [[Carlo Tresca]] (63), an Italian American labor leader who led opposition to [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]], [[Stalinism]] and Mafia control of unions, was shot dead at a Manhattan intersection on the night of 11 January 1943.

Historians believe the most likely suspect was mobster [[Carmine Galante]], later acting boss of the [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno family]], seen fleeing the scene, who had likely acted on the orders of a Bonanno [[underboss]] and Fascist sympathizer Tresca had threatened to expose.<ref name=\"Carlo Tresca\">{{cite news |title=Who Hired the Assassin? |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DE173AF931A35753C1A96E948260|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 October 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2014 | first=Alfred | last=Kazin}}</ref>\n* The beaten and partially burnt body of Sir [[Harry Oakes]] (68), an American-born British gold-mine owner and philanthropist, was found in his mansion in [[Nassau, Bahamas]] on 8 July 1943.

Robbery was seen as an unlikely motive since the family was very poor, and there were no signs of a struggle. The investigation was hampered by the still chaotic nature of French society barely a year after the end of the war; not until two years later was it established that the weapon used to kill the four was a [[Sten]], a submachine gun commonly used by the [[French Resistance]], giving rise to theories that the killings had something to do with it.

In subsequent years, it emerged that the investigation had been perfunctory, leaving much evidence unexamined and witness uninterviewed; a 2011 review of the surviving medical evidence found it highly likely that Molloy had survived his injuries for several hours, which raised the question of why emergency services were not called until after he was dead.

His father was an [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]] ethnic wealthy aristocratic nobleman in [[Lam S\u01a1n (ancient Vietnam)|Lam S\u01a1n]] (northern Vietnam). The town was in a newly colonized area of Vietnam which would eventually be called [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province]]. Lam Son had been established by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's great-grandfather Le Hoi sometime in the 1330s. His exact date of birth is not certain, but 1384 is generally agreed upon by historians.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Lam Son was on the frontier of Vietnam, and as a result it was further and hence more free from government control.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThis was a troubled time in Vietnam's history as the [[H\u1ed3 dynasty]] in 1400 finally displaced the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] and set about reforming the empire. H\u1ed3 rule was short lived as members of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty petitioned for intervention from the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] to the north. He responded by sending a powerful army south into [[Vietnam]] and vanquished the H\u1ed3. Upon failing to find a Tr\u1ea7n heir, the Ming government chose to re-establish sovereignty over Vietnam, as was the case in the days of the [[Tang dynasty]], some 500 years prior.<ref name=\"RETURN OF THE CHINESE AND THE LE NOI AND THE LE DYNASTY (1428-1778)\">{{cite web|publisher=factsanddetails|title=RETURN OF THE CHINESE AND THE LE NOI AND THE LE DYNASTY (1428-1778)|url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Vietnam/sub5_9a/entry-3335.html}}</ref>\n\nThe Ming government enjoyed some support from the Vietnamese, at least in the capital of [[Hanoi|Th\u0103ng Long]], but their efforts to assert control in the surrounding countryside were met with stiff resistance. The Vietnamese claim that the Ming military stole valuable artifacts from Vietnam such as gems, jade, golden pieces of art as well as books. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i himself said that he chose the path of revolt against China's brutal government when he personally witnessed the destruction of a Vietnamese village by Ming forces.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Revolt of 1418\u20131427 ===\n{{Main article|Lam S\u01a1n uprising}}\n{{Infobox Chinese\n|title=L\u00ea L\u1ee3i\n|vie=L\u00ea L\u1ee3i\n|hn={{linktext|\u9ece|\u5229}}\n}}\nL\u00ea L\u1ee3i began his campaign against the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] on the day after [[T\u1ebft]] (New Year) February 1418. He was supported by several prominent families from his native [[Thanh H\u00f3a province|Thanh H\u00f3a]], most famously were the [[Tr\u1ecbnh Lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] and the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Lords|Nguy\u1ec5n]] families. Initially, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i campaigned on the basis of restoring the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty|Tr\u1ea7n]] to power. A relative of the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty|Tr\u1ea7n]] emperor was chosen as the figurehead of the revolt but within a few years, the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty|Tr\u1ea7n]] pretender was removed and the unquestioned leader of the revolt was L\u00ea L\u1ee3i himself, under the name \"Pacifying King\" (Binh Dinh Vuong).<ref>''Le Loi''.

While L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was able to operate in [[Thanh H\u00f3a province|Thanh H\u00f3a]], he was, for 2\u20133 years, unable to muster the military forces required to defeat the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army in open battle. As a result, he waged a type of [[guerrilla war]] against the large and well organized [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army.\n\nOne famous story from this time is about the heroism of one of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's soldier, [[L\u00ea Lai]]. One time during the revolt, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's forces had been surrounded by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces on the top of a mountain. [[L\u00ea Lai]] devised a plan that would allow L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and the main bulk of the force to escape. He pretended to be L\u00ea L\u1ee3i to divert the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]  army's attention by dressing himself in L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's attire and lead a [[kamikaze]]-like charge down to attack the enemy. During the battle, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was able to escape.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060621134756/http://www.journeyfromthefall.com/showpages.asp?pid=1116 Le Loi \u2013 The Man and the Legend of the Golden Turtle God] journeyfromthefall.com (copy at the [[Internet Archive]])</ref>\n\nBesides fighting [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and his army also had to fight against ethnic minorities' forces whom the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] government bribed known collectively as Ai Lao ([[Laos]]) . Although there were many difficulties, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's army was able to suppress Ai Lao multiple times. However, because his force was not strong enough at the time, he had to lurk in the forests or mountains of Thanh Hoa province. Often due to lack of food supplies, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i had to order the killing of army horses and elephants for use as food.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In one particularly dangerous situation in 1422, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i made peace with the Ming army. But in 1423 when his forces were built up better, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i broke the peace agreement when the Ming army captured and killed his envoy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Reaching South===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\nBy Nguyen Chich tactic, 1424 L\u00ea L\u1ee3i decided to march his army to Nghe An plain. On the way, Lam Son army captured Da Cang fortress, beaten back Cam Banh forces, a commander who worked for the Ming. Lam Son forces attacked Tra Long garrison. Ming general Chen Zhi led reinforcement from Nghe An to Tra Long to rescue Cam Banh but was beaten back by Lam Son forces. Besieged by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, with Chen Zhi unable to rescue, Cam Banh eventually surrendered.\n\nL\u00ea L\u1ee3i sent Dinh Liet with a detachment to attack Nghe An, and the same time he took the main part of the army. Zhen Zhi was repeatedly defeated and had to retreat inside the Nghe An citadel.\n\nLi An, Fang Zheng from Dong Quan came to Nghe An to rescue Chen Zhi, while Chen also moved out his forces from the castle to join force with them. However the Ming forces were defeated, Chen Zhi had to retreat to Dong Quan, An and Chinh withdraw in Nghe An citadel.\n\nIn May 1425, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded Dinh Le to attack Dien Chau. Ming army lost and retreated to Dong Do (Thanh Hoa). Then L\u00ea L\u1ee3i also sent Le Sat, Le Nhan Chu. Le Trien supported Dinh Le for attack Tay Do, Ming army must retreat inside the castle.\n\nL\u00ea L\u1ee3i on one hand surrounded Nghe An and Tay Do, and on the other hand sent Tran Nguyen Han, Doan No, Le Da Bo to attack Tan Binh, Thuan Hoa. Ming general Nham Thang was defeated. Then L\u00ea L\u1ee3i sent Le Ngan, Le Van An to support Tran Nguyen Han. Ming army had to retreat.\n\nAs a result of these victories, from the end of 1425, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was in control all land from Thanh Hoa to the south, and besieged all the Ming's forces in the region.\n\n===T\u1ed1t \u0110\u1ed9ng \u2013 Ch\u00fac \u0110\u1ed9ng Victory===\n{{main article|Battle of T\u1ed1t \u0110\u1ed9ng \u2013 Ch\u00fac \u0110\u1ed9ng}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n\nOn 1426 August, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i divided his grand army into 3 parts. Pham Van Xao, Do Bi, Trinh Kha, and the expert swordsman Le Trien went North west, while the feared Luu Nhan Chu, and wise Bui Bi headed North East. The cavalry commander [[\u0110inh L\u1ec5]], and trusted lieutenant [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]] moved on Dong Quan. From the wilderness, Le Trien approached Dong Quan, when he ambushed Tran Tri and defeated Tri.\n\nMeanwhile, a Ming army was incoming from Yunnan. Trien divided forces and sent  Pham Van Xao, and Trinh Kha on a route to intercept, and combined Doanh Le, and Nguyen Xi, into a siege army to attack Dong Quan. Pham Van Xao defeated the Yunnan reinforcements. Van Nam forces fled and entrenched at the Xuong Giang rampart. Tran Tri's supply lines were threatened, and he sought Ly An reinforcements at Nghe An. Ly An, and Phuong Chinh commanded Thai Thuc to the keep Nghe An rampart, and sent forces to rescue Dong Quan. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded Le Van An's elite troops to surrounded the rampart, while he himself moved the main forces to the north.\n\nThe Ming Emperor sent Wang Zong, and Ma Ying to  the rescue. They combined all available Dong Quan forces and became 100.000 strong, then began a drive to Phuong Chinh. Le Trien and the infamous  thief Do Bi defeated Ma Qi at Tu Liem, and attacked Fang forces headlong. Fang and Ma fled and combined with the Wang Zong forces at Co So. Le Trien attacked Wang, but he had already prepared. Thien lost, retreated back to Cao Bo and sought help from Nguyen Xi. Dinh Le, Nguyen Xi took their forces to Tot Dong Chut Dong to prepare an ambush. They know Wang Zong would divide forces into two parts and raid Le Trien, so they enticed Wang to place an ambush force. Wang's army lost heavily, with Tran Hiep, Ly Luong and 50,000 soldiers killed, and 10,000 captured.  fled and entrenched at Dong Quan. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i got the victorious news and then sent Tran Nguyen Han, and Bui Bi to divide forces, and drive two ways towards Dong Quan.\n\n===Made Tran Cao Emperor===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n\nVuong Thong was lost. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i wanted Ming forces to withdraw fast. Meanwhile, court scholars found the reason the Ming government wanted to help the Tran enemies defeat Ho, and sent to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i a proclamation made which Tran descendants to become Emperor.\n\nVuong Thong agreed to the mutual agreement in outward appearance, but knew L\u00ea L\u1ee3i held a plan up his sleeve. After L\u00ea L\u1ee3i showed his hand, Vuong Thong made his move and broke the agreement.\n\n===Siege of Dong Quan fortress===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\nAfter a break in mutual agreement, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i sent some generals to attack and occupy key forts such as: Dieu Dieu, Tam Giang, Xuong Giang. They were occupied soon after.\n\nAt the beginning of 1427, he moved his troop to Nhi river, and attacked Dong Quan. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i created strict troop rule to assure the people that his troops would not be a threat to them.\n\nMing general Thai Thuc surrendered and handed over Nghe An. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i demand foreign minister [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] write a letter, insisting others generals to surrender.\n\nWhen Lam Son's garrison force at Dong Quan appeared weak, Ming cavalry attacked suddenly. Le Trien died at Tu Liem. Dinh Le. Nguyen Xi was captured at Thanh Tri. After that Dinh Le was killed, Nguyen Xi fled.\n\n===Chi Lang Xuong Giang Victory===\nAt the end of 1427, the Ming Emperor sent reinforcements to rescue Vuong Thong. Lieu Thang took 100,000 soldiers from [[Guangxi]]; Moc Thanh with 50,000 ones from [[Yun Nan]]. They were generals who  participated in the battle with Ho and Tran dynasty. According to some historians, 150,000 soldiers were magnified in number; in fact, the number was 120,000 and the main forces were belonged to Lieu Thang.<ref name=kknews.cc>{{cite web|url=https://kknews.cc/zh-cn/history/nbyg4eq.html|title=\u8d8a\u5357\u5f53\u5e74\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u660e\u671d\u72ec\u7acb\u51fa\u53bb\u7684?|date=28 August 2018|language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\n\nHeard this information, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and the generals wanted to attack and occupy Dong Quan immediately. However they listened to [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]]'s advice, attacking rampart was a bad solution because the Ming forces in the rampart were so crowded and food was full. So L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and generals decided to attack reinforcements first to discourage Ming forces at Dong Quan.\nAt first, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded to move the residents at [[L\u1ea1ng Giang District|L\u1ea1ng Giang]], [[B\u1eafc Giang Province|B\u1eafc Giang]], Quy Hoa, [[Tuy\u00ean Quang Province|Tuy\u00ean Quang]] to segregate Ming troops. He knew Lieu Thang kept the main forces, so he sent Le Sat, Le Nhan Chu, Le Van Linh, Dinh Liet to wait at Chi Lang, and the same time commanded Le Van An, Le Ly to take alternative forces to support. With Moc Thanh \u2018s forces, he knew Thanh was an experienced general and will be waiting for Lieu Thang's results before taking actions, so L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded Pham Van Xao and Trinh Kha entrenched all time.\n\nThe border general, Tran Luu, faked losing and ran away from Nam Quan gate to Luu gate and then moved to Chi Lang. On 18 September at lunar calendar, Thang followed to Chi Lang after.  Thinking Tran Luu have lost continuous, Thang was too optimistic and just took 100 cavalries for come after. On 20 September, Thang was killed by Tran Luu and Le Sat \u2018s forces and they shed all the remaining troop. All L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's generals got the opportunities and attacked Minh troops, killed 10,000 soldiers, cut Luong Minh, Ly Khanh committed suicide. Some remain Ming generals such as Hoang Thuc, Thoi Tu tried to retreat at Xuong Giang but they came there and knew the rampart was occupied. They forced to gather troops in empty field. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i sent Tran Nguyen Hang to block Ming's food transporting way, sent Pham Van, Nguyen Xi supported Le Sat and get close to attack, killed 50,000 Ming soldiers at Xuong Giang. Hoang Thuc with 30.000 Ming soldiers were arrested, Thoi Tu did not surrender and was killed. More than 70,000 Ming soldiers were killed or captured along Lang Son.<ref name=kknews.cc></ref>\n\nMoc Thanh heard Lieu Thang was killed so he retreated and ran away.

From these experiences he drew the inspiration to write [[B\u00ecnh Ng\u00f4 \u0111\u1ea1i c\u00e1o|B\u00ecnh Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u1ea1i C\u00e1o]], Proclamation of Victory over the Minh Invaders.

Land distribution were rewarded to soldiers that contributed in the war against the Ming Empire. New money currency was minted and new laws and reforms were passed. The system of selecting government administrators by examination was restored and exams were held at regular intervals throughout L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's reign.\n\nFrom 1430 to 1432, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and his army fought a set of campaigns in the hills to the west of the coastal area. Then, in 1433, he became sick and his health declined. On his deathbed he appointed L\u00ea S\u00e1t as the regent for his second son, who would rule after him as [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng]].\n\nInternal palace politics quickly decimated the ranks of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's trusted counselors, Tr\u1ea7n Nguy\u00ean H\u00e3n committed suicide when he was being taken to the capital for investigating his suspected betrayal, Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n X\u1ea3o was executed in 1432 and L\u00ea S\u00e1t, who ruled as regent for five years, was executed in 1438. Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i was killed in 1442 (it was claimed he was involved in or responsible for the death of [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng]]). Only Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3 survived to an old age and even he was executed in 1451.\n\n== Myths and legends ==\n{{main article|Heaven's Will}}\n[[File:Water puppets 329481647 7decc2a6e4 o.jpg|thumb|[[Water puppet]] of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i on the Lake of the Returned Sword]]\n[[Image:Hua-Quen See Hanoi.JPG|thumb|[[Hoan Kiem Lake|The Lake of the Returned Sword]] in [[Hanoi]] is where L\u00ea L\u1ee3i returned the sword to the Golden Turtle, according to the legend.]]\n\nMany legends and stories were told about L\u00ea L\u1ee3i. The most famous story concerns his magical sword. Much like [[King Arthur]] and his sword [[Excalibur]], L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was said to have a magic sword of wondrous power. One story tells that he obtained the sword, inscribed with the words '[[The Will of Heaven]]' ([[Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (sword)|Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean]]) from the Dragon King (Vietnamese: Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng), a demi-god to the local people, who decided to lend his sword to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i. But there was a catch: the sword did not come straight to him in one piece.\n\nIt was split into two parts: a blade and a sword hilt. First, in Thanh H\u00f3a province, there was a fisherman named L\u00ea Th\u1eadn, who was not related to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something heavy. Thinking of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited. However, his excitement soon turned into disappointment when he saw that his catch was a long, thin piece of metal which had somehow become entangled to the net. He threw it back into the water, and recast the net at a different location. When he pulled the net in, the metal piece had found its way back into the net. He picked it up and threw it far away with all its strength. The third time the fishing net came up, the same thing happened, the metal piece was once again caught in the net. Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and not knowing what to do with it, put it in the corner of his house. Some years later, L\u00ea Th\u1eadn joined the rebel army of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, where he quickly rose in ranks. Once, the general visited L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's home. L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's house lacked lighting, so everything was dark. But as though it was sensing the presence of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, the blade at the corner of the house suddenly emitted a bright glow. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i held up the blade and saw two words manifesting before his very eye: Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (Will of Heaven). With L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's endorsement, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i took the blade with him.\n\nOne day, while on the run from the enemy, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i saw a strange light emanating from the branches of a banyan tree. He climbed up and there he found a hilt of a sword, encrusted with precious gems. Remembering the blade he found earlier, he took it out and placed it into the hilt. The fit was perfect. Believing that the Heaven had entrusted him with the great cause of freeing the land, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i took up arms and rallied people under his banner. For the next few years, the magic sword brought him victory after another. His men no longer had to hide in the forest, but aggressively penetrated many enemy camps, captured them and seized their granaries. The sword helped them push back the enemy, until Vietnam was once again free from Chinese rule. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i ascended the throne in 1428, ending his 10-year campaign, and reclaimed independence for the country. The stories claim L\u00ea L\u1ee3i grew very tall when he used the sword and it gave him the strength of many men. Other stories say that the sword blade and the sword hilt came together from different places, the blade fished out of a lake, the hilt found by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i himself.\n\nThe stories largely agree on what happened to the sword: One day, not long after the Chinese had accepted Vietnam as independent, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was out boating on a lake in Hanoi. The golden turtle advanced toward the boat and the king, then with a human voice, it asked him to return the magic sword to his master, Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Dragon King), who lived under the water. Suddenly it became clear to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i that the sword was only lent to him to carry out his duty, but now it must be returned to its rightful owner, lest it corrupt him. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i drew the sword out of its scabbard and lobbed it towards the turtle. With great speed, the turtle opened its mouth and snatched the sword from the air with its teeth. It descended back into the water, with the shiny sword in its mouth . L\u00ea L\u1ee3i then acknowledged the sword had gone back to the Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Dragon King) and caused the lake to be renamed '[[Hoan Kiem Lake|The Lake of the Returned Sword]]' (Hoan Kiem Lake) located in present-day Hanoi.\n\nCountless poems and songs were written about L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, both during his lifetime and in later years. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i is looked upon as the perfect embodiment of the just, wise, and capable leader. All future Vietnamese kings were measured against the standard of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and most were found wanting.<ref>Education As a Political Tool in Asia - Page 147 Marie-Carine Lall, Edward Vickers - 2009 \"New heroes enter the national pantheon, first of all King L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and the cultured [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] who defeated the Chinese in 1427.\"</ref><ref>Van Dao Hoang ''Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang: A Contemporary History of a National ...

The town was in a newly colonized area of Vietnam which would eventually be called [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province]].

His exact date of birth is not certain, but 1384 is generally agreed upon by historians.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Lam Son was on the frontier of Vietnam, and as a result it was further and hence more free from government control.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThis was a troubled time in Vietnam's history as the [[H\u1ed3 dynasty]] in 1400 finally displaced the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] and set about reforming the empire. H\u1ed3 rule was short lived as members of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty petitioned for intervention from the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the Chinese [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] to the north. He responded by sending a powerful army south into [[Vietnam]] and vanquished the H\u1ed3. Upon failing to find a Tr\u1ea7n heir, the Ming government chose to re-establish sovereignty over Vietnam, as was the case in the days of the [[Tang dynasty]], some 500 years prior.<ref name=\"RETURN OF THE CHINESE AND THE LE NOI AND THE LE DYNASTY (1428-1778)\">{{cite web|publisher=factsanddetails|title=RETURN OF THE CHINESE AND THE LE NOI AND THE LE DYNASTY (1428-1778)|url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Vietnam/sub5_9a/entry-3335.html}}</ref>\n\nThe Ming government enjoyed some support from the Vietnamese, at least in the capital of [[Hanoi|Th\u0103ng Long]], but their efforts to assert control in the surrounding countryside were met with stiff resistance. The Vietnamese claim that the Ming military stole valuable artifacts from Vietnam such as gems, jade, golden pieces of art as well as books.

While L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was able to operate in [[Thanh H\u00f3a province|Thanh H\u00f3a]], he was, for 2\u20133 years, unable to muster the military forces required to defeat the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army in open battle. As a result, he waged a type of [[guerrilla war]] against the large and well organized [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army.\n\nOne famous story from this time is about the heroism of one of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's soldier, [[L\u00ea Lai]]. One time during the revolt, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's forces had been surrounded by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces on the top of a mountain.

Although there were many difficulties, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's army was able to suppress Ai Lao multiple times. However, because his force was not strong enough at the time, he had to lurk in the forests or mountains of Thanh Hoa province. Often due to lack of food supplies, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i had to order the killing of army horses and elephants for use as food.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In one particularly dangerous situation in 1422, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i made peace with the Ming army. But in 1423 when his forces were built up better, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i broke the peace agreement when the Ming army captured and killed his envoy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Reaching South===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\nBy Nguyen Chich tactic, 1424 L\u00ea L\u1ee3i decided to march his army to Nghe An plain.

Ming general Chen Zhi led reinforcement from Nghe An to Tra Long to rescue Cam Banh but was beaten back by Lam Son forces. Besieged by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, with Chen Zhi unable to rescue, Cam Banh eventually surrendered.\n\nL\u00ea L\u1ee3i sent Dinh Liet with a detachment to attack Nghe An, and the same time he took the main part of the army. Zhen Zhi was repeatedly defeated and had to retreat inside the Nghe An citadel.\n\nLi An, Fang Zheng from Dong Quan came to Nghe An to rescue Chen Zhi, while Chen also moved out his forces from the castle to join force with them.

The cavalry commander [[\u0110inh L\u1ec5]], and trusted lieutenant [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed]] moved on Dong Quan. From the wilderness, Le Trien approached Dong Quan, when he ambushed Tran Tri and defeated Tri.\n\nMeanwhile, a Ming army was incoming from Yunnan. Trien divided forces and sent  Pham Van Xao, and Trinh Kha on a route to intercept, and combined Doanh Le, and Nguyen Xi, into a siege army to attack Dong Quan. Pham Van Xao defeated the Yunnan reinforcements. Van Nam forces fled and entrenched at the Xuong Giang rampart. Tran Tri's supply lines were threatened, and he sought Ly An reinforcements at Nghe An. Ly An, and Phuong Chinh commanded Thai Thuc to the keep Nghe An rampart, and sent forces to rescue Dong Quan. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded Le Van An's elite troops to surrounded the rampart, while he himself moved the main forces to the north.\n\nThe Ming Emperor sent Wang Zong, and Ma Ying to  the rescue. They combined all available Dong Quan forces and became 100.000 strong, then began a drive to Phuong Chinh. Le Trien and the infamous  thief Do Bi defeated Ma Qi at Tu Liem, and attacked Fang forces headlong. Fang and Ma fled and combined with the Wang Zong forces at Co So. Le Trien attacked Wang, but he had already prepared. Thien lost, retreated back to Cao Bo and sought help from Nguyen Xi. Dinh Le, Nguyen Xi took their forces to Tot Dong Chut Dong to prepare an ambush. They know Wang Zong would divide forces into two parts and raid Le Trien, so they enticed Wang to place an ambush force.

Lieu Thang took 100,000 soldiers from [[Guangxi]]; Moc Thanh with 50,000 ones from [[Yun Nan]]. They were generals who  participated in the battle with Ho and Tran dynasty.

However they listened to [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]]'s advice, attacking rampart was a bad solution because the Ming forces in the rampart were so crowded and food was full. So L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and generals decided to attack reinforcements first to discourage Ming forces at Dong Quan.\nAt first, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded to move the residents at [[L\u1ea1ng Giang District|L\u1ea1ng Giang]], [[B\u1eafc Giang Province|B\u1eafc Giang]], Quy Hoa, [[Tuy\u00ean Quang Province|Tuy\u00ean Quang]] to segregate Ming troops. He knew Lieu Thang kept the main forces, so he sent Le Sat, Le Nhan Chu, Le Van Linh, Dinh Liet to wait at Chi Lang, and the same time commanded Le Van An, Le Ly to take alternative forces to support. With Moc Thanh \u2018s forces, he knew Thanh was an experienced general and will be waiting for Lieu Thang's results before taking actions, so L\u00ea L\u1ee3i commanded Pham Van Xao and Trinh Kha entrenched all time.\n\nThe border general, Tran Luu, faked losing and ran away from Nam Quan gate to Luu gate and then moved to Chi Lang. On 18 September at lunar calendar, Thang followed to Chi Lang after.  Thinking Tran Luu have lost continuous, Thang was too optimistic and just took 100 cavalries for come after. On 20 September, Thang was killed by Tran Luu and Le Sat \u2018s forces and they shed all the remaining troop. All L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's generals got the opportunities and attacked Minh troops, killed 10,000 soldiers, cut Luong Minh, Ly Khanh committed suicide. Some remain Ming generals such as Hoang Thuc, Thoi Tu tried to retreat at Xuong Giang but they came there and knew the rampart was occupied. They forced to gather troops in empty field. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i sent Tran Nguyen Hang to block Ming's food transporting way, sent Pham Van, Nguyen Xi supported Le Sat and get close to attack, killed 50,000 Ming soldiers at Xuong Giang. Hoang Thuc with 30.000 Ming soldiers were arrested, Thoi Tu did not surrender and was killed. More than 70,000 Ming soldiers were killed or captured along Lang Son.<ref name=kknews.cc></ref>\n\nMoc Thanh heard Lieu Thang was killed so he retreated and ran away.

The Ming imperial court accepted this arrangement, much as they accepted the vassal status of [[Korea]] under the [[Joseon dynasty]]. The Chinese largely left Vietnam alone for the next 500 years, intervening only about once every hundred years.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nL\u00ea L\u1ee3i embarked on a significant reorganization of the Vietnamese government, clearly based on the Confucian system of government which was developed by the Chinese [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties. He also elevated his longtime comrades and generals such as [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]],<ref>Burke ''Origines'' \"Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i is best known, however, as the military strategist who assisted L\u00ea L\u1ee3i in driving Ming forces out of Vietnam between 1407 and 1427.

The system of selecting government administrators by examination was restored and exams were held at regular intervals throughout L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's reign.\n\nFrom 1430 to 1432, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and his army fought a set of campaigns in the hills to the west of the coastal area. Then, in 1433, he became sick and his health declined.

The most famous story concerns his magical sword. Much like [[King Arthur]] and his sword [[Excalibur]], L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was said to have a magic sword of wondrous power. One story tells that he obtained the sword, inscribed with the words '[[The Will of Heaven]]' ([[Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (sword)|Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean]]) from the Dragon King (Vietnamese: Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng), a demi-god to the local people, who decided to lend his sword to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i. But there was a catch: the sword did not come straight to him in one piece.\n\nIt was split into two parts: a blade and a sword hilt. First, in Thanh H\u00f3a province, there was a fisherman named L\u00ea Th\u1eadn, who was not related to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i in any way. One night, his fishing net caught something heavy. Thinking of how much money he would get for this big fish, he became very excited. However, his excitement soon turned into disappointment when he saw that his catch was a long, thin piece of metal which had somehow become entangled to the net. He threw it back into the water, and recast the net at a different location. When he pulled the net in, the metal piece had found its way back into the net. He picked it up and threw it far away with all its strength. The third time the fishing net came up, the same thing happened, the metal piece was once again caught in the net. Bewildered, he brought his lamp closer and carefully examined the strange object. Only then did he notice that it was the missing blade of a sword. He took the blade home and not knowing what to do with it, put it in the corner of his house. Some years later, L\u00ea Th\u1eadn joined the rebel army of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, where he quickly rose in ranks. Once, the general visited L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's home. L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's house lacked lighting, so everything was dark. But as though it was sensing the presence of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, the blade at the corner of the house suddenly emitted a bright glow. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i held up the blade and saw two words manifesting before his very eye: Thu\u1eadn Thi\u00ean (Will of Heaven). With L\u00ea Th\u1eadn's endorsement, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i took the blade with him.\n\nOne day, while on the run from the enemy, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i saw a strange light emanating from the branches of a banyan tree. He climbed up and there he found a hilt of a sword, encrusted with precious gems. Remembering the blade he found earlier, he took it out and placed it into the hilt. The fit was perfect. Believing that the Heaven had entrusted him with the great cause of freeing the land, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i took up arms and rallied people under his banner. For the next few years, the magic sword brought him victory after another. His men no longer had to hide in the forest, but aggressively penetrated many enemy camps, captured them and seized their granaries. The sword helped them push back the enemy, until Vietnam was once again free from Chinese rule. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i ascended the throne in 1428, ending his 10-year campaign, and reclaimed independence for the country. The stories claim L\u00ea L\u1ee3i grew very tall when he used the sword and it gave him the strength of many men. Other stories say that the sword blade and the sword hilt came together from different places, the blade fished out of a lake, the hilt found by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i himself.\n\nThe stories largely agree on what happened to the sword: One day, not long after the Chinese had accepted Vietnam as independent, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was out boating on a lake in Hanoi. The golden turtle advanced toward the boat and the king, then with a human voice, it asked him to return the magic sword to his master, Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Dragon King), who lived under the water. Suddenly it became clear to L\u00ea L\u1ee3i that the sword was only lent to him to carry out his duty, but now it must be returned to its rightful owner, lest it corrupt him. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i drew the sword out of its scabbard and lobbed it towards the turtle. With great speed, the turtle opened its mouth and snatched the sword from the air with its teeth. It descended back into the water, with the shiny sword in its mouth . L\u00ea L\u1ee3i then acknowledged the sword had gone back to the Long V\u01b0\u01a1ng (Dragon King) and caused the lake to be renamed '[[Hoan Kiem Lake|The Lake of the Returned Sword]]' (Hoan Kiem Lake) located in present-day Hanoi.\n\nCountless poems and songs were written about L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, both during his lifetime and in later years. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i is looked upon as the perfect embodiment of the just, wise, and capable leader. All future Vietnamese kings were measured against the standard of L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and most were found wanting.<ref>Education As a Political Tool in Asia - Page 147 Marie-Carine Lall, Edward Vickers - 2009 \"New heroes enter the national pantheon, first of all King L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and the cultured [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] who defeated the Chinese in 1427.\"</ref><ref>Van Dao Hoang ''Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang: A Contemporary History of a National ...

{"title_page": "Cross product", "text_new": "{{About|the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space}}\n{{short description|Mathematical operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''cross product''' or '''vector product''' (occasionally '''directed area product''' to emphasize the geometric significance) is a [[binary operation]] on two [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s in [[three-dimensional space]] <math>\\left(\\mathbb{R}^3\\right)</math> and is denoted by the symbol <math>\\times</math>. Given two [[linearly independent vectors]] <math>\\mathbf{a}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{b}</math>, the cross product, <math>\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}</math> (read \"a cross b\"), is a vector that is [[perpendicular]] to both <math>\\mathbf{a}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> and thus [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, [[physics]], [[engineering]], and [[computer programming]]. It should not be confused with the [[dot product]] (projection product).\n\nIf two vectors have the same direction (or have the exact opposite direction from one another, i.e. are ''not'' linearly independent) or if either one has zero length, then their cross product is zero. More generally, the magnitude of the product equals the area of a [[parallelogram]] with the vectors for sides; in particular, the magnitude of the product of two perpendicular vectors is the product of their lengths. The cross product is [[anticommutativity|anticommutative]] (i.e. <math>\\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{b} = -\\mathbf{b}\\times \\mathbf{a}</math>) and is [[distributivity|distributive]] over addition (i.e. <math>\\mathbf{a}\\times (\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{c}</math>). The space <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> together with the cross product is an [[algebra over a field|algebra over the real numbers]], which is neither [[commutative]] nor [[associative]], but is a [[Lie algebra]] with the cross product being the [[Lie bracket]].\n\nLike the [[dot product]], it depends on the [[metric space|metric]] of [[Euclidean space]], but unlike the dot product, it also depends on a choice of [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] or \"[[Right-hand rule|handedness]]\". The product can be generalized in various ways; it can be made independent of orientation by changing the result to [[pseudovector]], or in arbitrary dimensions the [[exterior algebra|exterior product]] of vectors can be used with a [[bivector]] or [[two-form]] result. Also, using the orientation and metric structure just as for the traditional 3-dimensional cross product, one can in <math>n</math> dimensions take the product of <math>n-1</math> vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them. But if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results, it exists only in three and [[Seven-dimensional cross product|seven dimensions]].<ref name=Massey2>{{cite journal |title=Cross products of vectors in higher dimensional Euclidean spaces |author=WS Massey |year=1983 |jstor=2323537|quote=If one requires only three basic properties of the cross product ... it turns out that a cross product of vectors exists only in 3-dimensional and 7-dimensional Euclidean space. |pages=697\u2013701 |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=90 |issue=10 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/2323537}}</ref> (See [[Cross product#Generalizations|\u00a7 Generalizations]], below, for other dimensions.)  \n[[File:Cross product vector.svg|thumb|right|The cross product in respect to a right-handed coordinate system]]\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Right hand rule cross product.svg|thumb|Finding the direction of the cross product by the [[right-hand rule]].]]\n\nThe cross product of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' is defined only in three-dimensional space and is denoted by {{nowrap|1='''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}}.

If the vectors '''a''' and '''b''' are parallel (i.e., the angle ''\u03b8'' between them is either 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0), by the above formula, the cross product of '''a''' and '''b''' is the [[zero vector]] '''0'''.\n\n[[File:Cross product.gif|left|thumb|The cross product {{nowrap|'''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}} (vertical, in purple) changes as the angle between the vectors '''a''' (blue) and '''b''' (red) changes. The cross product is always orthogonal to both vectors, and has magnitude zero when the vectors are parallel and maximum magnitude \u2016'''a'''\u2016\u2016'''b'''\u2016 when they are orthogonal.]]\n\nBy convention, the direction of the vector '''n''' is given by the right-hand rule, where one simply points the forefinger of the right hand in the direction of '''a''' and the middle finger in the direction of '''b'''. Then, the vector '''n''' is coming out of the thumb (see the adjacent picture). Using this rule implies that the cross product is [[Anticommutativity|anti-commutative]], i.e., {{nowrap|1='''b''' \u00d7 '''a''' = \u2212('''a''' \u00d7 '''b''')}}. By pointing the forefinger toward '''b''' first, and then pointing the middle finger toward '''a''', the thumb will be forced in the opposite direction, reversing the sign of the product vector.\n\nUsing the cross product requires the handedness of the coordinate system to be taken into account (as explicit in the definition above). If a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Orientation and handedness|left-handed coordinate system]] is used, the direction of the vector '''n''' is given by the left-hand rule and points in the opposite direction.\n\nThis, however, creates a problem because transforming from one arbitrary reference system to another (e.g., a mirror image transformation from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system), should not change the direction of '''n'''. The problem is clarified by realizing that the cross product of two vectors is not a (true) vector, but rather a ''[[pseudovector]]''.  See [[Cross product#Cross product and handedness|cross product and handedness]] for more detail.\n\n== Names ==\n[[File:Sarrus rule.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|According to [[Sarrus's rule]], the [[determinant]] of a 3\u00d73 matrix involves multiplications between matrix elements identified by crossed diagonals]]\n\nIn 1881, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and independently [[Oliver Heaviside]], introduced both the [[dot product]] and the cross product using a period ({{nowrap|1='''a''' . '''b'''}}) and an \"x\" ({{nowrap|1='''a''' x '''b'''}}), respectively, to denote them.<ref name=ucd>[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~temple/MAT21D/SUPPLEMENTARY-ARTICLES/Crowe_History-of-Vectors.pdf ''A History of Vector Analysis'' by Michael J. Crowe], Math. UC Davis</ref>\n\nIn 1877, to emphasize the fact that the result of a dot product is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] while the result of a cross product is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], [[William Kingdon Clifford]] coined the alternative names '''scalar product''' and '''vector product''' for the two operations.<ref name=ucd/> These alternative names are still widely used in the literature.\n\nBoth the cross notation ({{nowrap|1='''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}}) and the name '''cross product''' were possibly inspired by the fact that each [[scalar component]] of {{nowrap|1='''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}} is computed by multiplying non-corresponding components of '''a''' and '''b'''. Conversely, a dot product {{nowrap|1='''a''' \u22c5 '''b'''}} involves multiplications between corresponding components of '''a''' and '''b'''. As explained [[#Matrix notation|below]], the cross product can be expressed in the form of a [[determinant]] of a special {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix. According to [[Sarrus's rule]], this involves multiplications between matrix elements identified by crossed diagonals.\n\n==Computing the cross product==\n\n===Coordinate notation===\n[[File:3D Vector.svg|300px|thumb|right|[[Standard basis]] vectors ('''i''', '''j''', '''k''', also denoted '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub>) and [[vector component]]s of '''a''' ('''a'''<sub>x</sub>, '''a'''<sub>y</sub>, '''a'''<sub>z</sub>, also denoted '''a'''<sub>1</sub>, '''a'''<sub>2</sub>, '''a'''<sub>3</sub>)]]\nThe [[standard basis]] vectors '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' satisfy the following equalities in a right hand coordinate system:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n  \\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}} &&= \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}} &&= \\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}} &&= \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nwhich imply, by the [[anticommutativity]] of the cross product, that \n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n  \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}} &&= -\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}} &&= -\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}} &&= -\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nThe anticommutativity of the cross product (and the obvious lack of linear independence) also implies that\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}\\times\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}} = \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}\\times\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}} = \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}\\times\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}} = \\mathbf{0}</math> (the [[zero vector]]).\n\nThese equalities, together with the [[distributivity]] and [[linearity]] of the cross product (but both do not follow easily from the definition given above), are sufficient to determine the cross product of any two vectors '''a''' and '''b'''.

The area of a parallelogram as the magnitude of a cross product]]\n[[File:Parallelepiped volume.svg|right|thumb|240px|Figure 2. Three vectors defining a parallelepiped]]\n\nThe [[Euclidean norm|magnitude]] of the cross product can be interpreted as the positive [[area]] of the [[parallelogram]] having '''a''' and '''b''' as sides (see Figure 1):\n\n:<math> \\left\\| \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} \\right\\| = \\left\\| \\mathbf{a} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{b} \\right\\| | \\sin \\theta | .</math>\n\nIndeed, one can also compute the volume ''V'' of a [[parallelepiped]] having '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''' as edges by using a combination of a cross product and a dot product, called [[scalar triple product]] (see Figure 2):\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{a}\\cdot(\\mathbf{b}\\times \\mathbf{c})=\n  \\mathbf{b}\\cdot(\\mathbf{c}\\times \\mathbf{a})=\n  \\mathbf{c}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{b}).\n</math>\n\nSince the result of the scalar triple product may be negative, the volume of the parallelepiped is given by its absolute value. For instance,\n\n:<math>V = |\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})|.</math>\n\nBecause the magnitude of the cross product goes by the sine of the angle between its arguments, the cross product can be thought of as a measure of ''perpendicularity'' in the same way that the [[dot product]] is a measure of ''parallelism''. Given two [[unit vectors]], their cross product has a magnitude of 1 if the two are perpendicular and a magnitude of zero if the two are parallel. The dot product of two unit vectors behaves just oppositely: it is zero when the unit vectors are perpendicular and 1 if the unit vectors are parallel.\n\nUnit vectors enable two convenient identities: the dot product of two unit vectors yields the cosine (which may be positive or negative) of the angle between the two unit vectors. The magnitude of the cross product of the two unit vectors yields the sine (which will always be positive).\n\n=== Algebraic properties ===\n\n[[File:Cross product scalar multiplication.svg|350px|thumb|Cross product [[scalar multiplication]].

For example, the winding of a polygon (clockwise or anticlockwise) about a point within the polygon can be calculated by triangulating the polygon (like spoking a wheel) and summing the angles (between the spokes) using the cross product to keep track of the sign of each angle.\n\nIn [[computational geometry]] of [[the plane]], the cross product is used to determine the sign of the [[acute angle]] defined by three points <math> p_1=(x_1,y_1), p_2=(x_2,y_2)</math> and <math> p_3=(x_3,y_3)</math>. It corresponds to the direction (upward or downward) of the cross product of the two coplanar [[vector (geometry)|vector]]s defined by the two pairs of points <math>(p_1, p_2)</math> and <math>(p_1, p_3)</math>. The sign of the acute angle is the sign of the expression\n:<math> P = (x_2-x_1)(y_3-y_1)-(y_2-y_1)(x_3-x_1),</math>\nwhich is the signed length of the cross product of the two vectors.\n\nIn the \"right-handed\" coordinate system,  if the result is 0, the points are [[collinear]]; if it is positive, the three points constitute a positive angle of rotation around <math> p_1</math> from <math> p_2</math> to <math> p_3</math>, otherwise a negative angle.

In red are the orthogonal [[unit vector]], and the \"parallel\" unit bivector.]]\nThe cross product can be defined in terms of the [[exterior product]]. In this context,{{which|date=June 2019}} it is an [[Cross product#External product|external product]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Greub, W|title=Multilinear Algebra|year=1978}}</ref> This view{{which|date=June 2019}} allows for a natural geometric interpretation of the cross product. In [[exterior algebra]] the exterior product of two vectors is a [[bivector]]. A bivector is an oriented plane element, in much the same way that a vector is an oriented line element. Given two vectors ''a'' and ''b'', one can view the bivector {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}} as the oriented parallelogram spanned by ''a'' and ''b''. The cross product is then obtained by taking the [[Hodge star]] of the bivector {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}}, mapping [[p-vector|2-vectors]] to vectors:\n\n:<math>a \\times b = \\star (a \\wedge b) \\,.</math>\n\nThis can be thought of as the oriented multi-dimensional element \"perpendicular\" to the bivector. Only in three dimensions is the result an oriented line element \u2013 a vector \u2013 whereas, for example, in 4 dimensions the Hodge dual of a bivector is two-dimensional \u2013 another oriented plane element. So, only in three dimensions is the cross product of ''a'' and ''b'' the vector dual to the bivector {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}}: it is perpendicular to the bivector, with orientation dependent on the coordinate system's handedness, and has the same magnitude relative to the unit normal vector as {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}} has relative to the unit bivector; precisely the properties described above.\n\n== Cross product and handedness ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Vector calculus]] -->\n\nWhen measurable quantities involve cross products, the ''handedness'' of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, it should be possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the handedness of the coordinate system is ''not'' fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a [[pseudovector]]. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nMore generally, the result of a cross product may be either a vector or a pseudovector, depending on the type of its operands (vectors or pseudovectors). Namely, vectors and pseudovectors are interrelated in the following ways under application of the cross product:\n\n* vector &times; vector = pseudovector\n* pseudovector &times; pseudovector = pseudovector\n* vector &times; pseudovector = vector\n* pseudovector &times; vector = vector.\n\nSo by the above relationships, the unit basis vectors '''i''', '''j''' and '''k''' of an orthonormal, right-handed (Cartesian) coordinate frame '''must''' all be pseudovectors (if a basis of mixed vector types is disallowed, as it normally is) since {{nowrap|1='''i''' \u00d7 '''j''' = '''k'''}}, {{nowrap|1='''j''' \u00d7 '''k''' = '''i'''}} and {{nowrap|1='''k''' \u00d7 '''i''' = '''j'''}}.\n\nBecause the cross product may also be a (true) vector, it may not change direction with a mirror image transformation. This happens, according to the above relationships, if one of the operands is a (true) vector and the other one is a pseudovector (e.g., the cross product of two vectors). For instance, a [[vector triple product]] involving three (true) vectors is a (true) vector.\n\nA handedness-free approach is possible using [[exterior algebra]].\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThere are several ways to generalize the cross product to the higher dimensions.\n\n=== Lie algebra ===\n{{Main|Lie algebra}}\nThe cross product can be seen as one of the simplest Lie products, and is thus generalized by [[Lie algebra]]s, which are axiomatized as binary products satisfying the axioms of multilinearity, skew-symmetry, and the Jacobi identity. Many Lie algebras exist, and their study is a major field of mathematics, called [[Lie theory]].\n\nFor example, the [[Heisenberg algebra]] gives another Lie algebra structure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^3.</math> In the basis <math>\\{x,y,z\\},</math> the product is <math>[x,y]=z, [x,z]=[y,z]=0.</math>\n\n=== Quaternions ===\n{{Further|quaternions and spatial rotation}}\nThe cross product can also be described in terms of [[quaternion]]s, and this is why the letters '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' are a convention for the standard basis on '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The unit vectors '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' correspond to \"binary\" (180 deg) rotations about their respective axes (Altmann, S. L., 1986, Ch. 12), said rotations being represented by \"pure\" quaternions (zero real part) with unit norms.\n\nFor instance, the above given cross product relations among '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' agree with the multiplicative relations among the quaternions ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''. In general, if a vector {{nowrap|[''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub>]}} is represented as the quaternion {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>''i'' + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''j'' + ''a''<sub>3</sub>''k''}}, the cross product of two vectors can be obtained by taking their product as quaternions and deleting the real part of the result. The real part will be the negative of the [[dot product]] of the two vectors.\n\nAlternatively, using the above identification of the 'purely imaginary' quaternions with '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the cross product may be thought of as half of the [[commutator]] of two quaternions.\n\n=== Octonions ===\n{{See also|Seven-dimensional cross product|Octonion}}\nA cross product for 7-dimensional vectors can be obtained in the same way by using the [[octonions]] instead of the quaternions. The nonexistence of nontrivial vector-valued cross products of two vectors in other dimensions is related to the result from [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] that the only [[normed division algebra]]s are the ones with dimension 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\n=== Exterior product ===\n{{Main|Exterior algebra|Comparison of vector algebra and geometric algebra#Cross and exterior products}}\nIn general dimension, there is no direct analogue of the binary cross product that yields specifically a vector. There is however the [[exterior product]], which has similar properties, except that the exterior product of two vectors is now a [[p-vector|2-vector]] instead of an ordinary vector. As mentioned above, the cross product can be interpreted as the exterior product in three dimensions by using the Hodge star operator to map 2-vectors to vectors.  The Hodge dual of the exterior product yields an {{nowrap|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-vector, which is a natural generalization of the cross product in any number of dimensions.\n\nThe exterior product and dot product can be combined (through summation) to form the [[Geometric algebra|geometric product]] in [[geometric algebra]].\n\n=== External product ===\nAs mentioned above, the cross product can be interpreted in three dimensions as the Hodge dual of the exterior product. In any finite ''n'' dimensions, the Hodge dual of the exterior product of {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} vectors is a vector. So, instead of a binary operation, in arbitrary finite dimensions, the cross product is generalized as the Hodge dual of the exterior product of some given {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} vectors. This generalization is called '''external product'''.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Hogben, L|editor-link= Leslie Hogben |title=Handbook of Linear Algebra|year=2007}}{{page needed|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Commutator product ===\n{{Main|Geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|Cross product#Cross product and handedness|Cross product#Lie algebra}}\n\nInterpreting the three-dimensional [[vector space]] of the algebra as the [[bivector|2-vector]] (not the 1-vector) [[Graded vector space|subalgebra]] of the three-dimensional [[geometric algebra]], where <math>\\mathbf{i} = \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2}</math>, the cross product corresponds exactly to the [[geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|commutator product]] in geometric algebra and both use the same symbol <math>\\times</math>.

While the commutator product of two 1-vectors is indeed the same as the [[exterior product]] and yields a 2-vector, the commutator of a 1-vector and a 2-vector yields a true vector, corresponding instead to the [[Geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|left and right contractions]] in geometric algebra. The commutator product of two 2-vectors has no corresponding equivalent product, which is why the commutator product is defined in the first place for 2-vectors. Furthermore, the commutator triple product of three 2-vectors is the same as the [[vector triple product]] of the same three pseudovectors in vector algebra. However, the commutator triple product of three 1-vectors in geometric algebra is instead the [[Sign (mathematics)#Sign of a direction|negative]] of the [[vector triple product]] of the same three true vectors in vector algebra.\n\nGeneralizations to higher dimensions is provided by the same commutator product of 2-vectors in higher-dimensional geometric algebras, but the 2-vectors are no longer pseudovectors. Just as the commutator product/cross product of 2-vectors in three dimensions [[Cross product#Lie algebra|correspond to the simplest Lie algebra]], the 2-vector subalgebras of higher dimensional geometric algebra equipped with the commutator product also correspond to the Lie algebras.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists|year=2003|last1=Doran|first1=Chris|last2=Lasenby|first2=Anthony|pages=401\u2013408|isbn=978-0521715959|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Geometric_Algebra_for_Physicists.html?id=VW4yt0WHdjoC}}</ref> Also as in three dimensions, the commutator product could be further generalised to arbitrary multivectors.\n\n=== Multilinear algebra ===\nIn the context of [[multilinear algebra]], the cross product can be seen as the (1,2)-tensor (a [[mixed tensor]], specifically a [[bilinear map]]) obtained from the 3-dimensional [[volume form]],<ref group=\"note\">By a volume form one means a function that takes in ''n'' vectors and gives out a scalar, the volume of the [[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors: <math> V\\times \\cdots \\times V \\to \\mathbf{R}.</math> This is an ''n''-ary multilinear skew-symmetric form. In the presence of a basis, such as on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n,</math> this is given by the [[determinant]], but in an abstract vector space, this is added structure. In terms of [[G-structure|''G''-structures]], a volume form is an [[Special linear group|<math> SL</math>]]-structure.</ref> a (0,3)-tensor, by [[Raising and lowering indices|raising an index]].\n\nIn detail, the 3-dimensional volume form defines a product <math> V \\times V \\times V \\to \\mathbf{R},</math> by taking the determinant of the matrix given by these 3 vectors.\nBy [[Dual space|duality]], this is equivalent to a function <math> V \\times V \\to V^*,</math> (fixing any two inputs gives a function <math> V \\to \\mathbf{R}</math> by evaluating on the third input) and in the presence of an [[inner product]] (such as the [[dot product]]; more generally, a non-degenerate bilinear form), we have an isomorphism <math> V \\to V^*,</math> and thus this yields a map <math> V \\times V \\to V,</math> which is the cross product: a (0,3)-tensor (3 vector inputs, scalar output) has been transformed into a (1,2)-tensor (2 vector inputs, 1 vector output) by \"raising an index\".\n\nTranslating the above algebra into geometry, the function \"volume of the parallelepiped defined by <math> (a,b,-)</math>\" (where the first two vectors are fixed and the last is an input), which defines a function <math> V \\to \\mathbf{R}</math>, can be ''represented'' uniquely as the dot product with a vector: this vector is the cross product <math> a \\times b.</math> From this perspective, the cross product is ''defined'' by the [[scalar triple product]], <math>\\mathrm{Vol}(a,b,c) = (a\\times b)\\cdot c.</math>\n\nIn the same way, in higher dimensions one may define generalized cross products by raising indices of the ''n''-dimensional volume form, which is a <math> (0,n)</math>-tensor.\nThe most direct generalizations of the cross product are to define either:\n* a <math> (1,n-1)</math>-tensor, which takes as input <math> n-1</math> vectors, and gives as output 1 vector \u2013 an <math> (n-1)</math>-ary vector-valued product, or\n* a <math> (n-2,2)</math>-tensor, which takes as input 2 vectors and gives as output [[skew-symmetric tensor]] of rank {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 2}} \u2013 a binary product with rank {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 2}} tensor values.  One can also define <math>(k,n-k)</math>-tensors for other ''k''.\n\nThese products are all multilinear and skew-symmetric, and can be defined in terms of the determinant and [[parity (physics)|parity]].\n\nThe <math> (n-1)</math>-ary product can be described as follows: given <math> n-1</math> vectors <math> v_1,\\dots,v_{n-1}</math> in <math>\\mathbf{R}^n,</math> define their generalized cross product <math> v_n = v_1 \\times \\cdots \\times v_{n-1}</math> as:\n* perpendicular to the hyperplane defined by the <math> v_i,</math>\n* magnitude is the volume of the parallelotope defined by the <math> v_i,</math> which can be computed as the [[Gram determinant]] of the <math> v_i,</math>\n* oriented so that <math> v_1,\\dots,v_n</math> is positively oriented.\nThis is the unique multilinear, alternating product which evaluates to <math> e_1 \\times \\cdots \\times e_{n-1} = e_n</math>, <math> e_2 \\times \\cdots \\times e_n = e_1,</math> and so forth for cyclic permutations of indices.\n\nIn coordinates, one can give a formula for this <math> (n-1)</math>-ary analogue of the cross product in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> by:\n\n:<math>\\bigwedge(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_{n-1}) =\n  \\begin{vmatrix}\n    v_1{}^1 &\\cdots &v_1{}^{n}\\\\\n    \\vdots  &\\ddots &\\vdots\\\\\n    v_{n-1}{}^1 & \\cdots &v_{n-1}{}^{n}\\\\\n    \\mathbf{e}_1 &\\cdots &\\mathbf{e}_{n}\n  \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThis formula is identical in structure to the determinant formula for the normal cross product in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> except that the row of basis vectors is the last row in the determinant rather than the first. The reason for this is to ensure that the ordered vectors ('''v'''<sub>1</sub>, ...,'''v'''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, \u039b('''v'''<sub>1</sub>, ...,'''v'''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>)) have a positive [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] with respect to ('''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>). If ''n'' is odd, this modification leaves the value unchanged, so this convention agrees with the normal definition of the binary product. In the case that ''n'' is even, however, the distinction must be kept. This <math> (n-1)</math>-ary form enjoys many of the same properties as the vector cross product: it is [[alternating form|alternating]] and linear in its arguments, it is perpendicular to each argument, and its magnitude gives the hypervolume of the region bounded by the arguments. And just like the vector cross product, it can be defined in a coordinate independent way as the Hodge dual of the wedge product of the arguments.\n\n=== Skew-symmetric matrix ===\n\nIf the cross product is defined as a binary operation, it takes as ''input'' exactly two vectors. If its ''output'' is not required to be a vector or a pseudovector but instead a ''[[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'', then it can be generalized in an arbitrary number of dimensions.<ref name=cross_prod_Maxwell_ND>{{Cite journal |author = A.

Given two quaternions {{nowrap|[0, '''u''']}} and {{nowrap|[0, '''v''']}}, where '''u''' and '''v''' are vectors in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, their quaternion product can be summarized as {{nowrap|[\u2212'''u''' \u22c5 '''v''', '''u''' \u00d7 '''v''']}}. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] used Hamilton's quaternion tools to develop his famous [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetism equations]], and for this and other reasons quaternions for a time were an essential part of physics education.\n\nIn 1878 [[William Kingdon Clifford]] published his [[Elements of Dynamic]] which was an advanced text for its time. He defined the product of two vectors<ref>[[William Kingdon Clifford]] (1878) [http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04370002 Elements of Dynamic]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Part I, page 95, London: MacMillan & Co; online presentation by [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Mathematical Monographs''</ref> to have magnitude equal to the [[area]] of the [[parallelogram]] of which they are two sides, and direction perpendicular to their plane.\n\n[[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] also felt that quaternion methods were too cumbersome, often requiring the scalar or vector part of a result to be extracted. Thus, about forty years after the quaternion product, the [[dot product]] and cross product were introduced &mdash; to heated opposition. Pivotal to (eventual) acceptance was the efficiency of the new approach, allowing Heaviside to reduce the equations of electromagnetism from Maxwell's original 20 to the four commonly seen today.<ref>{{Cite book |first = Paul J.|last = Nahin |title = Oliver Heaviside: the life, work, and times of an electrical genius of the Victorian age|publisher = JHU Press |isbn = 0-8018-6909-9 |year = 2000 |pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nLargely independent of this development, and largely unappreciated at the time, [[Hermann Grassmann]] created a geometric algebra not tied to dimension two or three, with the [[exterior product]] playing a central role.

Gibbs's notation and the name \"cross product\" later reached a wide audience through [[Vector Analysis]], a textbook by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]], a former student.

If the vectors '''a''' and '''b''' are parallel (i.e., the angle ''\u03b8'' between them is either 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0), by the above formula, the cross product of '''a''' and '''b''' is the [[zero vector]] '''0'''.\n\n[[File:Cross product.gif|left|thumb|The cross product {{nowrap|'''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}} (vertical, in purple) changes as the angle between the vectors '''a''' (blue) and '''b''' (red) changes. The cross product is always orthogonal to both vectors, and has magnitude zero when the vectors are parallel and maximum magnitude \u2016'''a'''\u2016\u2016'''b'''\u2016 when they are orthogonal.]]\n\nBy convention, the direction of the vector '''n''' is given by the right-hand rule, where one simply points the forefinger of the right hand in the direction of '''a''' and the middle finger in the direction of '''b'''. Then, the vector '''n''' is coming out of the thumb (see the adjacent picture). Using this rule implies that the cross product is [[Anticommutativity|anti-commutative]], i.e., {{nowrap|1='''b''' \u00d7 '''a''' = \u2212('''a''' \u00d7 '''b''')}}. By pointing the forefinger toward '''b''' first, and then pointing the middle finger toward '''a''', the thumb will be forced in the opposite direction, reversing the sign of the product vector.\n\nUsing the cross product requires the handedness of the coordinate system to be taken into account (as explicit in the definition above). If a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Orientation and handedness|left-handed coordinate system]] is used, the direction of the vector '''n''' is given by the left-hand rule and points in the opposite direction.\n\nThis, however, creates a problem because transforming from one arbitrary reference system to another (e.g., a mirror image transformation from a right-handed to a left-handed coordinate system), should not change the direction of '''n'''. The problem is clarified by realizing that the cross product of two vectors is not a (true) vector, but rather a ''[[pseudovector]]''.  See [[Cross product#Cross product and handedness|cross product and handedness]] for more detail.\n\n== Names ==\n[[File:Sarrus rule.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|According to [[Sarrus's rule]], the [[determinant]] of a 3\u00d73 matrix involves multiplications between matrix elements identified by crossed diagonals]]\n\nIn 1881, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and independently [[Oliver Heaviside]], introduced both the [[dot product]] and the cross product using a period ({{nowrap|1='''a''' . '''b'''}}) and an \"x\" ({{nowrap|1='''a''' x '''b'''}}), respectively, to denote them.<ref name=ucd>[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~temple/MAT21D/SUPPLEMENTARY-ARTICLES/Crowe_History-of-Vectors.pdf ''A History of Vector Analysis'' by Michael J. Crowe], Math. UC Davis</ref>\n\nIn 1877, to emphasize the fact that the result of a dot product is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] while the result of a cross product is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], [[William Kingdon Clifford]] coined the alternative names '''scalar product''' and '''vector product''' for the two operations.<ref name=ucd/> These alternative names are still widely used in the literature.\n\nBoth the cross notation ({{nowrap|1='''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}}) and the name '''cross product''' were possibly inspired by the fact that each [[scalar component]] of {{nowrap|1='''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''}} is computed by multiplying non-corresponding components of '''a''' and '''b'''. Conversely, a dot product {{nowrap|1='''a''' \u22c5 '''b'''}} involves multiplications between corresponding components of '''a''' and '''b'''. As explained [[#Matrix notation|below]], the cross product can be expressed in the form of a [[determinant]] of a special {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix. According to [[Sarrus's rule]], this involves multiplications between matrix elements identified by crossed diagonals.\n\n==Computing the cross product==\n\n===Coordinate notation===\n[[File:3D Vector.svg|300px|thumb|right|[[Standard basis]] vectors ('''i''', '''j''', '''k''', also denoted '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub>) and [[vector component]]s of '''a''' ('''a'''<sub>x</sub>, '''a'''<sub>y</sub>, '''a'''<sub>z</sub>, also denoted '''a'''<sub>1</sub>, '''a'''<sub>2</sub>, '''a'''<sub>3</sub>)]]\nThe [[standard basis]] vectors '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' satisfy the following equalities in a right hand coordinate system:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n  \\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}} &&= \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}} &&= \\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}} &&= \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nwhich imply, by the [[anticommutativity]] of the cross product, that \n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\n  \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}} &&= -\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}} &&= -\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}\\\\\n  \\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}&\\times\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}} &&= -\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nThe anticommutativity of the cross product (and the obvious lack of linear independence) also implies that\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}}\\times\\mathbf{\\color{blue}{i}} = \\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}}\\times\\mathbf{\\color{red}{j}} = \\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}}\\times\\mathbf{\\color{green}{k}} = \\mathbf{0}</math> (the [[zero vector]]).\n\nThese equalities, together with the [[distributivity]] and [[linearity]] of the cross product (but both do not follow easily from the definition given above), are sufficient to determine the cross product of any two vectors '''a''' and '''b'''.

Three vectors defining a parallelepiped]]\n\nThe [[Euclidean norm|magnitude]] of the cross product can be interpreted as the positive [[area]] of the [[parallelogram]] having '''a''' and '''b''' as sides (see Figure 1):\n\n:<math> \\left\\| \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} \\right\\| = \\left\\| \\mathbf{a} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{b} \\right\\| | \\sin \\theta | .</math>\n\nIndeed, one can also compute the volume ''V'' of a [[parallelepiped]] having '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''' as edges by using a combination of a cross product and a dot product, called [[scalar triple product]] (see Figure 2):\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{a}\\cdot(\\mathbf{b}\\times \\mathbf{c})=\n  \\mathbf{b}\\cdot(\\mathbf{c}\\times \\mathbf{a})=\n  \\mathbf{c}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{b}).\n</math>\n\nSince the result of the scalar triple product may be negative, the volume of the parallelepiped is given by its absolute value. For instance,\n\n:<math>V = |\\mathbf{a} \\cdot (\\mathbf{b} \\times \\mathbf{c})|.</math>\n\nBecause the magnitude of the cross product goes by the sine of the angle between its arguments, the cross product can be thought of as a measure of ''perpendicularity'' in the same way that the [[dot product]] is a measure of ''parallelism''. Given two [[unit vectors]], their cross product has a magnitude of 1 if the two are perpendicular and a magnitude of zero if the two are parallel. The dot product of two unit vectors behaves just oppositely: it is zero when the unit vectors are perpendicular and 1 if the unit vectors are parallel.\n\nUnit vectors enable two convenient identities: the dot product of two unit vectors yields the cosine (which may be positive or negative) of the angle between the two unit vectors. The magnitude of the cross product of the two unit vectors yields the sine (which will always be positive).\n\n=== Algebraic properties ===\n\n[[File:Cross product scalar multiplication.svg|350px|thumb|Cross product [[scalar multiplication]].

For example, the winding of a polygon (clockwise or anticlockwise) about a point within the polygon can be calculated by triangulating the polygon (like spoking a wheel) and summing the angles (between the spokes) using the cross product to keep track of the sign of each angle.\n\nIn [[computational geometry]] of [[the plane]], the cross product is used to determine the sign of the [[acute angle]] defined by three points <math> p_1=(x_1,y_1), p_2=(x_2,y_2)</math> and <math> p_3=(x_3,y_3)</math>. It corresponds to the direction (upward or downward) of the cross product of the two coplanar [[vector (geometry)|vector]]s defined by the two pairs of points <math>(p_1, p_2)</math> and <math>(p_1, p_3)</math>.

In red are the orthogonal [[unit vector]], and the \"parallel\" unit bivector.]]\nThe cross product can be defined in terms of the [[exterior product]]. In this context,{{which|date=June 2019}} it is an [[Cross product#External product|external product]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Greub, W|title=Multilinear Algebra|year=1978}}</ref> This view{{which|date=June 2019}} allows for a natural geometric interpretation of the cross product. In [[exterior algebra]] the exterior product of two vectors is a [[bivector]]. A bivector is an oriented plane element, in much the same way that a vector is an oriented line element. Given two vectors ''a'' and ''b'', one can view the bivector {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}} as the oriented parallelogram spanned by ''a'' and ''b''. The cross product is then obtained by taking the [[Hodge star]] of the bivector {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}}, mapping [[p-vector|2-vectors]] to vectors:\n\n:<math>a \\times b = \\star (a \\wedge b) \\,.</math>\n\nThis can be thought of as the oriented multi-dimensional element \"perpendicular\" to the bivector. Only in three dimensions is the result an oriented line element \u2013 a vector \u2013 whereas, for example, in 4 dimensions the Hodge dual of a bivector is two-dimensional \u2013 another oriented plane element. So, only in three dimensions is the cross product of ''a'' and ''b'' the vector dual to the bivector {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}}: it is perpendicular to the bivector, with orientation dependent on the coordinate system's handedness, and has the same magnitude relative to the unit normal vector as {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2227 ''b''}} has relative to the unit bivector; precisely the properties described above.\n\n== Cross product and handedness ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Vector calculus]] -->\n\nWhen measurable quantities involve cross products, the ''handedness'' of the coordinate systems used cannot be arbitrary. However, when physics laws are written as equations, it should be possible to make an arbitrary choice of the coordinate system (including handedness). To avoid problems, one should be careful to never write down an equation where the two sides do not behave equally under all transformations that need to be considered. For example, if one side of the equation is a cross product of two vectors, one must take into account that when the handedness of the coordinate system is ''not'' fixed a priori, the result is not a (true) vector but a [[pseudovector]]. Therefore, for consistency, the other side must also be a pseudovector.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nMore generally, the result of a cross product may be either a vector or a pseudovector, depending on the type of its operands (vectors or pseudovectors). Namely, vectors and pseudovectors are interrelated in the following ways under application of the cross product:\n\n* vector &times; vector = pseudovector\n* pseudovector &times; pseudovector = pseudovector\n* vector &times; pseudovector = vector\n* pseudovector &times; vector = vector.\n\nSo by the above relationships, the unit basis vectors '''i''', '''j''' and '''k''' of an orthonormal, right-handed (Cartesian) coordinate frame '''must''' all be pseudovectors (if a basis of mixed vector types is disallowed, as it normally is) since {{nowrap|1='''i''' \u00d7 '''j''' = '''k'''}}, {{nowrap|1='''j''' \u00d7 '''k''' = '''i'''}} and {{nowrap|1='''k''' \u00d7 '''i''' = '''j'''}}.\n\nBecause the cross product may also be a (true) vector, it may not change direction with a mirror image transformation. This happens, according to the above relationships, if one of the operands is a (true) vector and the other one is a pseudovector (e.g., the cross product of two vectors). For instance, a [[vector triple product]] involving three (true) vectors is a (true) vector.\n\nA handedness-free approach is possible using [[exterior algebra]].\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThere are several ways to generalize the cross product to the higher dimensions.\n\n=== Lie algebra ===\n{{Main|Lie algebra}}\nThe cross product can be seen as one of the simplest Lie products, and is thus generalized by [[Lie algebra]]s, which are axiomatized as binary products satisfying the axioms of multilinearity, skew-symmetry, and the Jacobi identity. Many Lie algebras exist, and their study is a major field of mathematics, called [[Lie theory]].\n\nFor example, the [[Heisenberg algebra]] gives another Lie algebra structure on <math>\\mathbf{R}^3.</math> In the basis <math>\\{x,y,z\\},</math> the product is <math>[x,y]=z, [x,z]=[y,z]=0.</math>\n\n=== Quaternions ===\n{{Further|quaternions and spatial rotation}}\nThe cross product can also be described in terms of [[quaternion]]s, and this is why the letters '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' are a convention for the standard basis on '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. The unit vectors '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' correspond to \"binary\" (180 deg) rotations about their respective axes (Altmann, S. L., 1986, Ch. 12), said rotations being represented by \"pure\" quaternions (zero real part) with unit norms.\n\nFor instance, the above given cross product relations among '''i''', '''j''', and '''k''' agree with the multiplicative relations among the quaternions ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''. In general, if a vector {{nowrap|[''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub>]}} is represented as the quaternion {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub>''i'' + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''j'' + ''a''<sub>3</sub>''k''}}, the cross product of two vectors can be obtained by taking their product as quaternions and deleting the real part of the result. The real part will be the negative of the [[dot product]] of the two vectors.\n\nAlternatively, using the above identification of the 'purely imaginary' quaternions with '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the cross product may be thought of as half of the [[commutator]] of two quaternions.\n\n=== Octonions ===\n{{See also|Seven-dimensional cross product|Octonion}}\nA cross product for 7-dimensional vectors can be obtained in the same way by using the [[octonions]] instead of the quaternions. The nonexistence of nontrivial vector-valued cross products of two vectors in other dimensions is related to the result from [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] that the only [[normed division algebra]]s are the ones with dimension 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n\n=== Exterior product ===\n{{Main|Exterior algebra|Comparison of vector algebra and geometric algebra#Cross and exterior products}}\nIn general dimension, there is no direct analogue of the binary cross product that yields specifically a vector. There is however the [[exterior product]], which has similar properties, except that the exterior product of two vectors is now a [[p-vector|2-vector]] instead of an ordinary vector. As mentioned above, the cross product can be interpreted as the exterior product in three dimensions by using the Hodge star operator to map 2-vectors to vectors.  The Hodge dual of the exterior product yields an {{nowrap|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-vector, which is a natural generalization of the cross product in any number of dimensions.\n\nThe exterior product and dot product can be combined (through summation) to form the [[Geometric algebra|geometric product]] in [[geometric algebra]].\n\n=== External product ===\nAs mentioned above, the cross product can be interpreted in three dimensions as the Hodge dual of the exterior product. In any finite ''n'' dimensions, the Hodge dual of the exterior product of {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} vectors is a vector. So, instead of a binary operation, in arbitrary finite dimensions, the cross product is generalized as the Hodge dual of the exterior product of some given {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} vectors. This generalization is called '''external product'''.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Hogben, L|editor-link= Leslie Hogben |title=Handbook of Linear Algebra|year=2007}}{{page needed|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Commutator product ===\n{{Main|Geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|Cross product#Cross product and handedness|Cross product#Lie algebra}}\n\nInterpreting the three-dimensional [[vector space]] of the algebra as the [[bivector|2-vector]] (not the 1-vector) [[Graded vector space|subalgebra]] of the three-dimensional [[geometric algebra]], where <math>\\mathbf{i} = \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2}</math>, the cross product corresponds exactly to the [[geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|commutator product]] in geometric algebra and both use the same symbol <math>\\times</math>.

While the commutator product of two 1-vectors is indeed the same as the [[exterior product]] and yields a 2-vector, the commutator of a 1-vector and a 2-vector yields a true vector, corresponding instead to the [[Geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|left and right contractions]] in geometric algebra. The commutator product of two 2-vectors has no corresponding equivalent product, which is why the commutator product is defined in the first place for 2-vectors. Furthermore, the commutator triple product of three 2-vectors is the same as the [[vector triple product]] of the same three pseudovectors in vector algebra. However, the commutator triple product of three 1-vectors in geometric algebra is instead the [[Sign (mathematics)#Sign of a direction|negative]] of the [[vector triple product]] of the same three true vectors in vector algebra.\n\nGeneralizations to higher dimensions is provided by the same commutator product of 2-vectors in higher-dimensional geometric algebras, but the 2-vectors are no longer pseudovectors. Just as the commutator product/cross product of 2-vectors in three dimensions [[Cross product#Lie algebra|correspond to the simplest Lie algebra]], the 2-vector subalgebras of higher dimensional geometric algebra equipped with the commutator product also correspond to the Lie algebras.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists|year=2003|last1=Doran|first1=Chris|last2=Lasenby|first2=Anthony|pages=401\u2013408|isbn=978-0521715959|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Geometric_Algebra_for_Physicists.html?id=VW4yt0WHdjoC}}</ref> Also as in three dimensions, the commutator product could be further generalised to arbitrary multivectors.\n\n=== Multilinear algebra ===\nIn the context of [[multilinear algebra]], the cross product can be seen as the (1,2)-tensor (a [[mixed tensor]], specifically a [[bilinear map]]) obtained from the 3-dimensional [[volume form]],<ref group=\"note\">By a volume form one means a function that takes in ''n'' vectors and gives out a scalar, the volume of the [[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors: <math> V\\times \\cdots \\times V \\to \\mathbf{R}.</math> This is an ''n''-ary multilinear skew-symmetric form. In the presence of a basis, such as on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n,</math> this is given by the [[determinant]], but in an abstract vector space, this is added structure. In terms of [[G-structure|''G''-structures]], a volume form is an [[Special linear group|<math> SL</math>]]-structure.</ref> a (0,3)-tensor, by [[Raising and lowering indices|raising an index]].\n\nIn detail, the 3-dimensional volume form defines a product <math> V \\times V \\times V \\to \\mathbf{R},</math> by taking the determinant of the matrix given by these 3 vectors.\nBy [[Dual space|duality]], this is equivalent to a function <math> V \\times V \\to V^*,</math> (fixing any two inputs gives a function <math> V \\to \\mathbf{R}</math> by evaluating on the third input) and in the presence of an [[inner product]] (such as the [[dot product]]; more generally, a non-degenerate bilinear form), we have an isomorphism <math> V \\to V^*,</math> and thus this yields a map <math> V \\times V \\to V,</math> which is the cross product: a (0,3)-tensor (3 vector inputs, scalar output) has been transformed into a (1,2)-tensor (2 vector inputs, 1 vector output) by \"raising an index\".\n\nTranslating the above algebra into geometry, the function \"volume of the parallelepiped defined by <math> (a,b,-)</math>\" (where the first two vectors are fixed and the last is an input), which defines a function <math> V \\to \\mathbf{R}</math>, can be ''represented'' uniquely as the dot product with a vector: this vector is the cross product <math> a \\times b.</math> From this perspective, the cross product is ''defined'' by the [[scalar triple product]], <math>\\mathrm{Vol}(a,b,c) = (a\\times b)\\cdot c.</math>\n\nIn the same way, in higher dimensions one may define generalized cross products by raising indices of the ''n''-dimensional volume form, which is a <math> (0,n)</math>-tensor.\nThe most direct generalizations of the cross product are to define either:\n* a <math> (1,n-1)</math>-tensor, which takes as input <math> n-1</math> vectors, and gives as output 1 vector \u2013 an <math> (n-1)</math>-ary vector-valued product, or\n* a <math> (n-2,2)</math>-tensor, which takes as input 2 vectors and gives as output [[skew-symmetric tensor]] of rank {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 2}} \u2013 a binary product with rank {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 2}} tensor values.  One can also define <math>(k,n-k)</math>-tensors for other ''k''.\n\nThese products are all multilinear and skew-symmetric, and can be defined in terms of the determinant and [[parity (physics)|parity]].\n\nThe <math> (n-1)</math>-ary product can be described as follows: given <math> n-1</math> vectors <math> v_1,\\dots,v_{n-1}</math> in <math>\\mathbf{R}^n,</math> define their generalized cross product <math> v_n = v_1 \\times \\cdots \\times v_{n-1}</math> as:\n* perpendicular to the hyperplane defined by the <math> v_i,</math>\n* magnitude is the volume of the parallelotope defined by the <math> v_i,</math> which can be computed as the [[Gram determinant]] of the <math> v_i,</math>\n* oriented so that <math> v_1,\\dots,v_n</math> is positively oriented.\nThis is the unique multilinear, alternating product which evaluates to <math> e_1 \\times \\cdots \\times e_{n-1} = e_n</math>, <math> e_2 \\times \\cdots \\times e_n = e_1,</math> and so forth for cyclic permutations of indices.\n\nIn coordinates, one can give a formula for this <math> (n-1)</math>-ary analogue of the cross product in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> by:\n\n:<math>\\bigwedge(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_{n-1}) =\n  \\begin{vmatrix}\n    v_1{}^1 &\\cdots &v_1{}^{n}\\\\\n    \\vdots  &\\ddots &\\vdots\\\\\n    v_{n-1}{}^1 & \\cdots &v_{n-1}{}^{n}\\\\\n    \\mathbf{e}_1 &\\cdots &\\mathbf{e}_{n}\n  \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThis formula is identical in structure to the determinant formula for the normal cross product in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> except that the row of basis vectors is the last row in the determinant rather than the first. The reason for this is to ensure that the ordered vectors ('''v'''<sub>1</sub>, ...,'''v'''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, \u039b('''v'''<sub>1</sub>, ...,'''v'''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>)) have a positive [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] with respect to ('''e'''<sub>1</sub>, ..., '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>). If ''n'' is odd, this modification leaves the value unchanged, so this convention agrees with the normal definition of the binary product. In the case that ''n'' is even, however, the distinction must be kept. This <math> (n-1)</math>-ary form enjoys many of the same properties as the vector cross product: it is [[alternating form|alternating]] and linear in its arguments, it is perpendicular to each argument, and its magnitude gives the hypervolume of the region bounded by the arguments. And just like the vector cross product, it can be defined in a coordinate independent way as the Hodge dual of the wedge product of the arguments.\n\n=== Skew-symmetric matrix ===\n\nIf the cross product is defined as a binary operation, it takes as ''input'' exactly two vectors. If its ''output'' is not required to be a vector or a pseudovector but instead a ''[[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'', then it can be generalized in an arbitrary number of dimensions.<ref name=cross_prod_Maxwell_ND>{{Cite journal |author = A.

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] used Hamilton's quaternion tools to develop his famous [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetism equations]], and for this and other reasons quaternions for a time were an essential part of physics education.\n\nIn 1878 [[William Kingdon Clifford]] published his [[Elements of Dynamic]] which was an advanced text for its time.

Pivotal to (eventual) acceptance was the efficiency of the new approach, allowing Heaviside to reduce the equations of electromagnetism from Maxwell's original 20 to the four commonly seen today.<ref>{{Cite book |first = Paul J.|last = Nahin |title = Oliver Heaviside: the life, work, and times of an electrical genius of the Victorian age|publisher = JHU Press |isbn = 0-8018-6909-9 |year = 2000 |pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nLargely independent of this development, and largely unappreciated at the time, [[Hermann Grassmann]] created a geometric algebra not tied to dimension two or three, with the [[exterior product]] playing a central role.

He goes to a music teacher to learn music and returns to his native village after many years of training. In the village, the shepherdess Tani is considered a gifted singer, and Tansen falls in love with her. Tani rescues an elephant and Tansen tames it by his singing. This captures the attention of Raja Ramchandra, of Rewa State. He becomes Tansen's friend. At the same time in [[Agra]], the Mughal emperor Akbar regrets that there is no musician in his ''navratnas''. Akbar sends a few of his workers to the countryside to find  the best musician. While his workers are searching, they come across Tansen, who while singing for Tani brings a leafless tree to bloom. The workers are overwhelmed at this and ask Tansen to go to the court of Akbar along with them. Tansen refuses at first by saying that he will sing for no one other than his sweetheart Tani. After repeated persuasions, he finally agrees to go to Agra where he enthralls Akbar by his singing. Akbar appoints him as one of his ''navratnas''. The other musicians in the royal court see this move as a threat to their reputation and status in the court.\n\nOn Akbar's birthday, Tani goes to Agra to meet Tansen and in order to meet her, Tansen refuses to sing on the king's birthday. Upon meeting Tani, Akbar tells her that Tansen is married and asks her to leave. He does so thinking that a broken heart will inspire even better music from Tansen. When Akbar later asks Tansen to sing, he refuses to do so saying that he would accept even the death penalty, but would not sing. One of the court musicians, Zehen Khan tells Akbar and his sick princess that the Deepak [[raga|raag]] has the magic of igniting things. Akbar asks Tansen to sing the Deepak raag, but again he refuses. Finally, on repeated persuasions by the sick princess, Tansen agrees to sing. Tansen ignites the candles placed near him when he is singing. He continues singing in extreme heat and gets badly burnt. When Akbar learns from Azam Khan (the court physician) that Zehen Khan and the other court musicians were plotting against Tansen, he orders the arrest of them all. Meanwhile, Tansen's condition worsens. [[Birbal]], the court philosopher suggests to Akbar that a singer who can sing the Malhar raag (known for bringing heavy rain) should be searched for. Akbar himself searches for such a singer, but is unable to find one. The dying Tansen wishes to meet his friend Raja Ramchandra. Along the way to his village Tansen meets Tani near a fountain and she heals him by singing the Megh Malhar raag.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[K. L.
