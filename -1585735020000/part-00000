Sharpe, 1996 {{ISBN|1-56324-864-6}} p. 26</ref>\n\nAs of January 2012, cow remains a divisive and controversial topic in India. Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. [[Madhya Pradesh]] enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. \n\nGujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits the killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Odisha, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producers and consumers of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing \"If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cows when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Indians split over cow ban|publisher=Asia Times| date=6 January 2012| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA06Df05.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cow slaughter ban: Using sensitivities to politically polarising ends works against democracy|date=10 January 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/editorial/cow-slaughter-ban-using-sensitivities-to-politically-polarising-ends-works-against-democracy/articleshow/11430557.cms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Livestock and poultry: world markets and trade|date=October 2011|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Indian cuisine}}\n{{multiple image\n | right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer = [[Indian cuisine]] is diverse, ranging from very spicy to very mild, varying with seasons in each region.

Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and [[Demographics of India|varied demographics]] of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories \u2013 [[North Indian cuisine|northern]], [[South Indian cuisine|southern]], eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many [[list of Indian spices|spices]] and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is [[vegetarian]], many Indian dishes also include meats like [[chicken]], [[mutton]], [[beef]] (both cow and buffalo), [[pork]] and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]] and the southern states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|title=Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals|year=1997|publisher=Serif|isbn=978-1-897959-50-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|Some Indian confectionery [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|desserts]] from hundreds of varieties.

Varied uses of spices are an integral part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish and create unique flavours and aromas. Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the [[Central Asia]]ns, [[Arabs]], [[Mughals]], and [[Colonialism in India|European colonists]].

Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]], [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]] built by Raja Raja Chola, the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]], [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[stupa]] (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at [[Bhattiprolu]].

[[Angkor Wat]], Borobudur and other [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.\n\nThe traditional system of [[Vaastu Shastra]] serves as India's version of [[Feng Shui]], influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or [[Prana]] in Sanskrit and [[Qi|Chi]]/[[Qi|Ki]] in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.\n\nWith the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] style of architecture. The [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] is one of the earliest examples.

The [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] and the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] are notable examples.\n\nIndian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or [[stupa]], temple spire or [[shikhara]], temple tower or [[pagoda]] and temple gate or [[torana]], have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The central spire is also sometimes called a [[Gopuram|vimanam]].

The [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharat]] were among the popular television series produced.

Hence the government started another channel that had part of national programming and part regional. This channel was known as DD 2 (later DD Metro). Both channels were broadcast terrestrially.\n\nIn 1991, the government liberated its markets, opening them up to [[cable television]]. Since then, there has been a spurt in the number of channels available. Today, the Indian small screen is a huge industry by itself and offers hundreds of programmes in almost all the regional languages of India. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind, some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps enjoy popularity among women of all classes.

With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.\n\n==Perceptions of Indian culture==\n{{Main|Stereotypes of South Asians}}\n[[File:Cropped Tripuri.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children prepare for a traditional dance in [[Tripura]]. The Tripuris, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.]]\nIndia's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of \"Indian culture\" is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of \"Indianness\" extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression \"Indian\" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)\n\nAccording to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society.<ref name=\"makar\">{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0QB43fNiTKkC&printsec=frontcover|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59869-211-2}}</ref> This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way, many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is [[Caste system in India|the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations]]. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 [[gotra]], the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas & sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The [[patriarch]] often resolves family issues.<ref name=\"makar\"/>\n\nOthers have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with [[C. K. Prahalad|C.K. Prahalad]] by [[Des Dearlove]], author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions, and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad \u2013 who was born in India and grew up there \u2013 claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On the verge of something extraordinary|author=Des Dearlove|author-link=Des Dearlove| journal=Business Strategy Review|date=Spring 2009|pages=17\u201320|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/109/index.html|ref=harv}}</ref> In another report, Nancy Lockwood of [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside the home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Amartya Sen]], the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonialism over centuries and current Western culture \u2013 both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 between India and the West.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|author=Amartya Sen|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-312-42602-6|url=https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Writings-History-Identity/dp/tags-on-product/031242602X}}</ref> There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised descriptions of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren't born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:\n* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, \"a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans.\"\n* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill's imperialist history thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While a great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.\n* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be freer from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, has an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.\n\nThe curatorial approach, one inspired by a systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.\n\n[[Susan Bayly]], in her book, observes that there is a considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of the pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India.

Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised.<ref name=rosser1>{{cite journal|title=Stereotypes in Schooling: Negative Pressures in the American Educational System on Hindu Identity Formation |journal=Teaching South Asia, A Journal of Pedagogy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=23\u201376 |url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094030/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |archivedate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref> Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments.

Several states of India have passed laws to protect cows, while many states have no restrictions on the production and consumption of beef. Some groups oppose the butchering of cows, while other secular groups argue that what kind of meat one eats ought to be a matter of personal choice in a democracy. [[Madhya Pradesh]] enacted a law in January 2012, namely the Gau-Vansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Act, which makes cow slaughter a serious offence. \n\nGujarat, a western state of India, has the Animal Preservation Act, enacted in October 2011, that prohibits the killing of cows along with buying, selling and transport of beef. In contrast, Odisha, Assam and Andhra Pradesh allow butchering of cattle with a fit-for-slaughter certificate. In the states of West Bengal and Kerala, consumption of beef is not deemed an offence. Contrary to stereotypes, a sizeable number of Hindus eat beef, and many argue that their scriptures, such as Vedic and Upanishadic texts do not prohibit its consumption. In southern Indian state Kerala, for instance, beef accounts for nearly half of all meat consumed by all communities, including Hindus. Sociologists theorise that the widespread consumption of cow meat in India is because it is a far cheaper source of animal protein for the poor than mutton or chicken, which retail at double the price. For these reasons, India's beef consumption post-independence in 1947 has witnessed a much faster growth than any other kind of meat; currently, India is one of the five largest producers and consumers of cattle livestock meat in the world. A beef ban has been made in Maharashtra and other states as of 2015. While states such as Madhya Pradesh are passing local laws to prevent cruelty to cows, other Indians are arguing \"If the real objective is to prevent cruelty to animals, then why single out the cows when hundreds of other animals are maltreated?\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Indians split over cow ban|publisher=Asia Times| date=6 January 2012| url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/NA06Df05.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cow slaughter ban: Using sensitivities to politically polarising ends works against democracy|date=10 January 2012|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/editorial/cow-slaughter-ban-using-sensitivities-to-politically-polarising-ends-works-against-democracy/articleshow/11430557.cms}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Livestock and poultry: world markets and trade|date=October 2011|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/livestock_poultry.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Cuisine==\n{{Main|Indian cuisine}}\n{{multiple image\n | right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer = [[Indian cuisine]] is diverse, ranging from very spicy to very mild, varying with seasons in each region.

Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the local produce, cultural diversity, and [[Demographics of India|varied demographics]] of the country. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into five categories \u2013 [[North Indian cuisine|northern]], [[South Indian cuisine|southern]], eastern, western, and northeastern. The diversity of Indian cuisine is characterised by the differing use of many [[list of Indian spices|spices]] and herbs, a wide assortment of recipes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is [[vegetarian]], many Indian dishes also include meats like [[chicken]], [[mutton]], [[beef]] (both cow and buffalo), [[pork]] and fish, egg and other seafood. Fish-based cuisines are common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]] and the southern states of [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Chitrita|title=Bengali Cooking: Seasons and Festivals|year=1997|publisher=Serif|isbn=978-1-897959-50-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chum chums.jpg|thumb|Some Indian confectionery [[Sweets of the Indian subcontinent|desserts]] from hundreds of varieties.

The classical form of old Indo-Aryan was ''Sanskrit'' meaning polished, cultivated and correct, in distinction to ''Prakrit'' \u2013 the practical language of the migrating masses evolving without concern to proper pronunciation or grammar, the structure of language changing as those masses mingled, settled new lands and adopted words from people of other native languages. ''Prakrita'' became middle Indo-Aryan leading to ''Pali'' (the language of early Buddhists and Ashoka era in 200\u2013300 BCE), ''Prakrit'' (the language of Jain philosophers) and ''Apabhramsa'' (the language blend at the final stage of middle Indo-Aryan). It is ''Apabhramsa'', scholars claim,<ref name=burrow1/> that flowered into Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, and many other languages now in use in India's north, east and west. All of these Indian languages have roots and structures similar to Sanskrit, to each other and to other Indo-European languages. Thus we have in India three thousand years of continuous linguistic history recorded and preserved in literary documents. This enables scholars to follow language evolution and observe how, by changes hardly noticeable from generation to generation, an original language alters into descendant languages that are now barely recognisable as the same.<ref name=burrow1/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n| width=\"200\" |{{Photomontage\n| photo1a = (1) Bandanna Sweet Pink.jpg{{!}}Bandanna\n| photo1b = A platinum bangle with diamonds.jpg{{!}}Bangle\n| photo2a = Bungalow, on the B4313, near Rosebush - geograph.org.uk - 1000849.jpg{{!}}Bungalow\n| photo2b = Hair wash with shampoo.jpg{{!}}Shampoo\n| spacing = 1\n| size = 200\n| foot_montage =Numerous words from India entered English vocabulary during the British colonial era.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18796493 Hobson-Jobson: The words English owes to India] M.J.

Among the present day artists, Atul Dodiya, Bose Krishnamacnahri, [[Devajyoti Ray]] and Shibu Natesan represent a new era of Indian art where global art shows direct amalgamation with Indian classical styles. These recent artists have acquired international recognition.

Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism developed further, India produced some extremely intricate [[bronze]]s as well as temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not constructed by using blocks but carved out of solid rock.\n\nSculptures produced in the northwest, in [[stucco]], [[schist]], or [[clay]], display a very strong blend of Indian and Classical [[Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]] influence. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] evolved almost simultaneously. During the [[Gupta period]] (4th to 6th centuries) sculpture reached a very high standard in execution and delicacy in modeling. These styles and others elsewhere in India evolved leading to classical Indian art that contributed to Buddhist and Hindu sculptures throughout Southeast Central and East Asia.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of India}}\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ellora Cave 16 si0308.jpg|[[Kailasa temple, Ellora|Kailasa temple]] is one of the largest [[Indian rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] ancient [[Hindu]] temples located in [[Ellora]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].\nFile:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|The granite [[Gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].\nFile:Warangal fort.jpg|[[Kakatiya Kala Thoranam]] (Warangal Gate) built by the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] in ruins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5889/|title=The Glorious Kakatiya Temples and Gateways|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>\nFile:Le temple de Chennakesava (Somanathapura, Inde) (14465165685).jpg|[[Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura|Chennakesava Temple]] is a model example of the [[Hoysala architecture]].\nFile:Chaturbhuj Temple, Orchha.jpg|[[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbhuj Temple]] at [[Orchha]], is noted for having one of the [[List_of_tallest_Gopurams#Tallest_Vimana|tallest Vimana]] among [[Hindu temple]]s standing at 344 feet.

The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. Some of its earliest production are found in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (2600\u20131900 BC) which is characterised by well-planned cities and houses. [[Religion]] and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning and layout of these towns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5892/|title=Dholavira: A Harappan City - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\n{{\nmultiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 250\n|image1     = Rani ki vav1.jpg\n|caption1   = [[Rani ki vav|Rani ki Vav]] (The Queen's stepwell) at [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]], [[Gujarat]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/922|title=Rani-ki-Vav (the Queen's Stepwell) at Patan, Gujarat|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n|image2     = View of Lord Nataraja at Temple museum.JPG\n|caption2   = Hall of Thousand Pillars at [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]]\n}}\nDuring the period of the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empires and their successors, several Buddhist architectural complexes, such as the caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]] were built. Later on, South India produced several Hindu temples like [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]], [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]] built by Raja Raja Chola, the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]], [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple]] at [[Srirangam]], and the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] [[stupa]] (Chinna Lanja dibba and Vikramarka kota dibba) at [[Bhattiprolu]]. [[Rajput kingdoms]] oversaw the construction of [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Temple Complex]], [[Chittor Fort]] and [[Chaturbhuj Temple (Orchha)|Chaturbhuj Temple]], etc. during their reign. [[Angkor Wat]], Borobudur and other [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] temples indicate strong Indian influence on South East Asian architecture, as they are built in styles almost identical to traditional Indian religious buildings.\n\nThe traditional system of [[Vaastu Shastra]] serves as India's version of [[Feng Shui]], influencing town planning, architecture, and ergonomics. It is unclear which system is older, but they contain certain similarities. Feng Shui is more commonly used throughout the world. Though Vastu is conceptually similar to Feng Shui in that it also tries to harmonise the flow of energy, (also called life-force or [[Prana]] in Sanskrit and [[Qi|Chi]]/[[Qi|Ki]] in Chinese/Japanese), through the house, it differs in the details, such as the exact directions in which various objects, rooms, materials, etc. are to be placed.\n\nWith the advent of Islamic influence from the west, Indian architecture was adapted to allow the traditions of the new religion, creating the [[Indo-Islamic architecture|Indo-Islamic]] style of architecture. The [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a group of monuments constructed by successive sultanas of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] is one of the earliest examples.

The [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] and the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] are notable examples.\n\nIndian architecture has influenced eastern and southeastern Asia, due to the spread of Buddhism. A number of Indian architectural features such as the temple mound or [[stupa]], temple spire or [[shikhara]], temple tower or [[pagoda]] and temple gate or [[torana]], have become famous symbols of Asian culture, used extensively in [[East Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. The central spire is also sometimes called a [[Gopuram|vimanam]]. The southern temple gate, or [[gopuram]] is noted for its intricacy and majesty.\n\nContemporary [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]] is more cosmopolitan.

The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind, some even attaining national fame for themselves. TV soaps enjoy popularity among women of all classes. Indian TV also consists of Western channels such as [[Cartoon Network]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[HBO]], and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]].\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of India}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Indian cinema\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Raja Harishchandra.jpg|A scene from ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913), the first full-length Indian motion picture\nFile:Phalke.jpg|Producer-director-screenwriter [[Dadasaheb Phalke]], the \"father of Indian cinema\"\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n|}\n''[[Bollywood]]'' is the informal name given to the popular [[Mumbai]]-based [[film|film industry]] in India. Bollywood and the other major cinematic hubs (in [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali Cinema]], [[Oriya film industry]], Assamese, Kannada, [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam]], Marathi, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Punjabi and Telugu) constitute the broader [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry]], whose output is considered to be the largest in the world in terms of number of films produced and number of tickets sold.\n\nIndia has produced many cinema-makers like [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Mrinal Sen]], [[J. C. Daniel]], [[Kasinathuni Viswanath]], [[Ram Gopal Varma]], [[Bapu (film director)|Bapu]], [[Ritwik Ghatak]], [[Guru Dutt]], [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]], [[Shaji N.

Balachander]] (see also: [[List of Indian film directors|Indian film directors]]). With the opening up of the economy in recent years and consequent exposure to world cinema, audience tastes have been changing. In addition, multiplexes have mushroomed in most cities, changing the revenue patterns.\n\n==Perceptions of Indian culture==\n{{Main|Stereotypes of South Asians}}\n[[File:Cropped Tripuri.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Children prepare for a traditional dance in [[Tripura]]. The Tripuris, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.]]\nIndia's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture. These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India. India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. The concept of \"Indian culture\" is a very complex and complicated matter. Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of \"Indianness\" extremely complicated. This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression \"Indian\" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)\n\nAccording to industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, for example, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that from an early age, children are reminded of their roles and places in society.<ref name=\"makar\">{{cite book|title=An American's Guide to Doing Business in India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0QB43fNiTKkC&printsec=frontcover|author=Eugene M. Makar|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59869-211-2}}</ref> This is reinforced, Makar notes, by the way, many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their life. Several differences such as religion divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is [[Caste system in India|the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations]]. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years, claims Makar. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes important family relations extend as far as 1 [[gotra]], the mainly patrilinear lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas & sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The [[patriarch]] often resolves family issues.<ref name=\"makar\"/>\n\nOthers have a different perception of Indian culture. According to an interview with [[C. K. Prahalad|C.K. Prahalad]] by [[Des Dearlove]], author of many best selling business books, modern India is a country of very diverse cultures with many languages, religions, and traditions. Children begin by coping and learning to accept and assimilate in this diversity. Prahalad \u2013 who was born in India and grew up there \u2013 claimed, in the interview, that Indians, like everyone else in the world, want to be treated as unique, as individuals, want to express themselves and seek innovation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On the verge of something extraordinary|author=Des Dearlove|author-link=Des Dearlove| journal=Business Strategy Review|date=Spring 2009|pages=17\u201320|url=http://bsr.london.edu/lbs-article/109/index.html|ref=harv}}</ref> In another report, Nancy Lockwood of [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, writes that in the past two decades or so, social change in India is in dramatic contrast to the expectations from traditional Indian culture. These changes have led to Indian families giving education opportunities to girls, accepting women working outside the home, pursuing a career, and opening the possibility for women to attain managerial roles in corporate India. Lockwood claims that change is slow, yet the scale of cultural change can be sensed from the fact that of India's 397 million workers, 124 million are now women. The issues in India with women empowerment are similar to those elsewhere in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Amartya Sen]], the India born Nobel Laureate in Economics, the culture of modern India is a complex blend of its historical traditions, influences from the effects of colonialism over centuries and current Western culture \u2013 both collaterally and dialectically. Sen observes that external images of India in the West often tend to emphasise the difference \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 between India and the West.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History, Culture and Identity|author=Amartya Sen|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-312-42602-6|url=https://www.amazon.com/Argumentative-Indian-Writings-History-Identity/dp/tags-on-product/031242602X}}</ref> There is a considerable inclination in the Western countries to distance and highlight the differences in Indian culture from the mainstream of Western traditions, rather than discover and show similarities. Western writers and media usually misses, in important ways, crucial aspects of Indian culture and traditions. The deep-seated heterogeneity of Indian traditions, in different parts of India, is neglected in these homogenised descriptions of India. The perceptions of Indian culture, by those who weren't born and raised in India, tend to be one of at least three categories, writes Sen:\n* Exoticist approach: it concentrates on the wondrous aspects of the culture of India. The focus of this approach of understanding Indian culture is to present the different, the strange and as Hegel put it, \"a country that has existed for millennia in the imaginations of the Europeans.\"\n* Magisterial approach: it assumes a sense of superiority and guardianship necessary to deal with India, a country that James Mill's imperialist history thought of as grotesquely primitive culture. While a great many British observers did not agree with such views of India, and some non-British ones did, it is an approach that contributes to some confusion about the culture of India.\n* Curatorial approach: it attempts to observe, classify and record the diversity of Indian culture in different parts of India. The curators do not look only for the strange, are not weighed by political priorities, and tend to be freer from stereotypes. The curatorial approach, nevertheless, has an inclination to see Indian culture as more special and extraordinarily interesting than it actually may be.\n\nThe curatorial approach, one inspired by a systematic curiosity for the cultural diversity of India within India, is mostly absent.\n\n[[Susan Bayly]], in her book, observes that there is a considerable dispute in India and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of the pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India. Bayly notes that much of the Indian subcontinent was populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste and strict social hierarchies were of only limited importance in their lifestyles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|author=Susan Bayly|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9780521264341}}</ref>\n\nTanisha Rathore from ''Thousand Miles Online Magazine'' wrote, \"Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi (since his government 2014) has taken many initiatives for a better environment, like to throw the trash in dustbins. I don\u2019t understand how graduates, post-graduates and sometimes doctorates fail to understand this; Trash should be thrown in bins which a toddler easily understands. Is this the successive evolution of the human brain in its educational years?\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thousandmilessite.in/coexistence-with-nature/|title=Coexistence With Nature {{!}} Articles|date=2019-02-25|website=Thousand Miles|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Rosser, an American sociologist, Americans of South Asian origins feel the Western perception of the culture of India has numerous stereotypes. Rosser notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about its religion and culture but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge whereas its pathetic attempts to modernise or develop are to be winked at and patronised.<ref name=rosser1>{{cite journal|title=Stereotypes in Schooling: Negative Pressures in the American Educational System on Hindu Identity Formation |journal=Teaching South Asia, A Journal of Pedagogy |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=23\u201376 |url=http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094030/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/Resources/vol-i.cfm |archivedate= 8 December 2015 }}</ref> Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments. The study reports a stark contrast between Western perceptions of the culture of India, versus the direct experience of the interviewed people. For example:\n\n{{quotation|The presentation of South Asians is a standard pedagogic approach which runs quickly from the \"Cradle of Civilisation\"\u2014contrasting the Indus Valley with Egypt and Mesopotamia\u2014on past the Aryans, who were somehow our ancestors\u2014 to the poverty-stricken, superstitious, polytheistic, caste-ridden Hindu way of life&nbsp;... and then somehow magically culminates with a eulogy of Mahatma Gandhi. A typical textbook trope presents standard Ancient India Meets the Age of Expansion Approach with a colour photo of the Taj Mahal. There may be a sidebar on ahimsa or a chart of connecting circles graphically explaining samsara and reincarnation or illustrations of the four stages of life or the Four Noble Truths. Amid the dearth of real information, there may be found an entire page dedicated to a deity such as Indra or Varuna, who admittedly are rather an obscure vis-\u00e0-vis the beliefs of most modern Hindus.|A South Asian in America<ref name=rosser1/>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|India}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[North Indian Culture]]\n* [[South Indian culture]]\n* [[Culture of the Indian subcontinent]]\n* [[Etiquette of Indian dining]]\n* [[Indian religions]]\n* [[Lists of Indians by state]]\n* [[South Asian ethnic groups]]\n* [[Atithi Devo Bhav]]\n* [[Cultural Zones of India]]\n* [[Glossary of Indian culture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|40em}} \n*[[Aurobindo|Ghose, Aurobindo]]. 1998.

During neural development Nogo is expressed mainly by neurons and provides an inhibitory signal for the migration and sprouting of CNS endothelial (tip) cells, thereby restricting blood vessel density.\n\nThis gene belongs to the family of [[reticulon]]-encoding genes. Reticulons are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. The product of this gene is a potent neurite outgrowth inhibitor that may also help block the regeneration of the central nervous system in higher vertebrates.

During neural development Nogo is expressed mainly by neurons and provides an inhibitory signal for the migration and sprouting of CNS endothelial (tip) cells, thereby restricting blood vessel density.\n\nThis gene belongs to the family of [[reticulon]]-encoding genes. Reticulons are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and are involved in neuroendocrine secretion or in membrane trafficking in neuroendocrine cells. The product of this gene is a potent neurite outgrowth inhibitor that may also help block the regeneration of the central nervous system in higher vertebrates. Alternatively spliced transcript variants derived both from differential splicing and differential promoter usage and encoding different isoforms have been identified.<ref name=\"entrez\"/> There are three [[isoforms]]: Nogo A, B and C. Nogo-A has two known inhibitory domains including amino-Nogo, at the N-terminus and Nogo-66, which makes up the molecules extracellular loop. Both amino-Nogo and Nogo-66 are involved in inhibitory responses, where amino-Nogo is a strong inhibitor of neurite outgrowth, and Nogo-66 is involved in [[growth cone]] destruction.<ref name=Karnezis2004/>\n\nResearch suggests that blocking Nogo-A during neuronal damage (from diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]]) will help to protect or restore the damaged neurons.<ref name=Karnezis2004>{{cite journal | vauthors = Karnezis T, Mandemakers W, McQualter JL, Zheng B, Ho PP, Jordan KA, Murray BM, Barres B, Tessier-Lavigne M, Bernard CC | display-authors = 6 | title = The neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo A is involved in autoimmune-mediated demyelination | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 736\u201344 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15184901 | doi = 10.1038/nn1261 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sozmen EG, Rosenzweig S, Llorente IL, DiTullio DJ, Machnicki M, Vinters HV, Havton LA, Giger RJ, Hinman JD, Carmichael ST | display-authors = 6 | title = Nogo receptor blockade overcomes remyelination failure after white matter stroke and stimulates functional recovery in aged mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 52 | pages = E8453-E8462 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27956620 | pmc = 5206535 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1615322113 }}</ref> The investigation into the mechanisms of this protein presents a great potential for the treatment of [[Autoimmune disease|auto-immune]] mediated [[demyelinating diseases]] and [[spinal cord injury]] [[Neuroregeneration|regeneration]].

From the start, the eastern city of [[Kharkiv]] served as the republic's capital. However, in 1934, the seat of government was subsequently moved to the city of [[Kiev]], Ukraine's historic capital. Kiev remained the capital for the rest of the Ukrainian SSR's existence, and remained the capital of independent Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nGeographically, the Ukrainian SSR was situated in [[Eastern Europe]] to the north of the [[Black Sea]], bordered by the Soviet republics of [[Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]], and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. The Ukrainian SSR's border with [[Czechoslovakia]] formed the Soviet Union's western-most border point. According to the [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet Census of 1989]] the republic had a population of 51,706,746 inhabitants, which [[Demographics of Ukraine#Historical data|fell sharply]] after the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]].

It is often perceived as being derived from the Slavic word \"okraina\", meaning \"border land\". It was first used to define part of the territory of [[Kievan Rus']] ([[Ruthenia]]) in the 12th century, at which point [[Kiev]] was the capital of Rus'. The name has been used in a variety of ways since the twelfth century. For example, [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] called their [[Cossack Hetmanate|hetmanate]] \"Ukraine\".\n\nWithin the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the name carried unofficial status for eastern parts of bigger [[Kiev Voivodeship|Kyiv Voivodeship]] and was overshadowed by the more common [[Lesser Poland|Little Poland]].\n\nSince the [[partition of Poland]], the name had generally disappeared and was replaced with the Russian imposed name \"Little Russia\".\n\n\"The Ukraine\" used to be the usual form in English,<ref name=\"merriam-webster\">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ukraine |title=Ukraine \u2013 Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> but since the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]], \"the Ukraine\" has become less common in the [[English-speaking world]], and style-guides warn against its use in professional writing.<ref name=UKrW812991TU>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499102.shtml |title=The \"the\" is gone |publisher=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]] |volume=LIX, No. 49 |date=8 December 1991 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Adam Taylor |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-ukraine-isnt-the-ukraine-and-why-that-matters-now-2013-12 |title=Why Ukraine Isn't 'The Ukraine,' And Why That Matters Now |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> According to U.S. ambassador [[William B.

During a period of civil war from 1917 to 1923 many factions claiming themselves governments of the newly born republic were formed, each with supporters and opponents. The two most prominent of them were a government in [[Kiev]] (called the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UPR)) and a government in [[Kharkiv]] (called the [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic]] (USR)). The Kiev-based UPR was internationally recognized and supported by the Central powers following the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereas the Kharkiv-based USR was solely supported by the Soviet Russian forces, while neither the UPR nor the USR were supported by the [[White movement|White Russian]] forces that remained.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:ZakapratskaUkraina1944.png|thumb|Front page of the Zakarpattia Ukraine newspaper (1944) with the manifest of unification with [[Soviet Ukraine]] (not the Ukrainian SSR)]]\nThe conflict between the two competing governments, known as the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]], was part of the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]], as well as a struggle for national independence, which ended with the pro-independence Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) being annexed into a new '''Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic''' ({{lang-uk|\u0423\u0421\u0420\u0420}}), western Ukraine being annexed into the [[Second Polish Republic]], and the newly stable Ukraine becoming a founding member of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe government of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was founded on 24\u201325 December 1917.

The last session of the government took place in the city of [[Taganrog]].\n\nIn July 1918, the former members of the government formed the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]], the constituent assembly of which took place in Moscow. With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], [[Bolshevik]] Russia resumed its hostilities towards the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] fighting for Ukrainian independence and organised another Soviet government in [[Kursk]], Russia. On 10 March 1919, according to the 3rd Congress of Soviets in Ukraine (conducted 6\u201310 March 1919) the name of the state was changed to the '''Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic''' (abbreviated \"\u0423\u0421\u0420\u0420\" in Ukrainian as opposed to the later \"\u0423\u0420\u0421\u0420\").<ref name=\"knowbysight\"/>\n\nAfter the ratification of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]], the names of all Soviet republics were changed, transposing the second (\"socialist\") and third (\"soviet\" or \"radianska\" in Ukrainian) words. In accordance, on 5 December 1936, the 8th Extraordinary Congress Soviets in Soviet Union changed the name of the republic to the \"'''Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic'''\", which was ratified by the 14th Extraordinary Congress of Soviets in Ukrainian SSR on 31 January 1937.<ref name=\"knowbysight\"/>\n\nDuring its existence, the Ukrainian SSR was commonly referred to as \"the Ukraine\".\n\nOn 24 August 1991, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic declared independence and the legal name of the republic was changed to the '''Ukraine''' on 17 September 1991. Since the adoption of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] in June 1996, the country became known simply as '''[[Ukraine]]''', which is the name used to this day.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Founding: 1917\u20131922 ===\n[[File:Bolsheviks Kharkov Ukraine anrc 04262a.jpg|thumb|Bolshevik commissars in Ukraine (1919).]]\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Map of Ukraine for Paris Peace Conference.jpg\n| caption1 = Territories claimed by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (1917\u20131920).\n| image2 = Europe location UkrSSR 1922.png\n| caption2 = Boundaries of the Ukrainian SSR (1922).\n}}\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], several factions sought to create an independent Ukrainian state, alternately cooperating and struggling against each other. Numerous more or less socialist-oriented factions participated in the formation of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UPR) among which were [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Menshevik]]s, Socialists-Revolutionaries, and many others. The most popular faction was initially the local [[Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionary Party]] that composed the local government together with Federalists and Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks boycotted any government initiatives most of the time, instigating several armed riots in order to establish the Soviet power without any intent for consensus.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nImmediately after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Petrograd]], Bolsheviks instigated the [[Kiev Bolshevik Uprising]] to support the Revolution and secure Kiev. Due to a lack of adequate support from the local population and anti-revolutionary Central Rada, however, the Kiev Bolshevik group split. Most moved to [[Kharkiv]] and received the support of the eastern Ukrainian cities and industrial centers. Later, this move was regarded as a mistake by some of the [[Narkom|People's Commissars]] ([[Yevgenia Bosch]]). They issued an ultimatum to the [[Central Rada]] on 17 December to recognise the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] of which the Rada was very critical. The Bolsheviks convened a separate congress and declared the first Soviet Republic of Ukraine on 24 December 1917 claiming the [[Central Rada]] and its supporters outlaws that need to be eradicated. Warfare ensued against the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) for the installation of the Soviet regime in the country and with the direct support from [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] the Ukrainian National forces were practically overran. The government of Ukraine appealed to foreign capitalists, finding the support in the face of the Central Powers as the others refused to recognise it. After the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the [[Russian SFSR]] yielded all the captured Ukrainian territory as the Bolsheviks were forced out of Ukraine. The government of the Soviet Ukraine was dissolved after its last session on 20 November 1918.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter re-taking Kharkiv in February 1919, a second Soviet Ukrainian government was formed, consisting mostly of Russians, Jews, and non-Ukrainians. The government enforced Russian policies that did not adhere to local needs. 3,000 workers were dispatched from Russia to take grain from local farms by force if necessary to feed Russian cities, and were met with resistance. The Ukrainian language was also censured from administrative and educational use. Eventually fighting both White forces in the east and republic forces in the west, Lenin ordered the liquidation of the second Soviet Ukrainian government in August 1919.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Subtelny|first1=Orest|title=Ukraine: A History|page=365|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=l5uiWHgRphQC&pg=PA475&dq=soviet+partisans+western+ukraine&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR5IPEjuTLAhVBlxoKHUuhAcsQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=365&f=false}}</ref>\n\nEventually, after the creation of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine]] in Moscow, a third Ukrainian Soviet government was formed on 21 December 1919 that initiated new hostilities against Ukrainian nationalists as they lost their military support from the defeated Central Powers. Eventually, the [[Red Army]] ended up controlling much of the Ukrainian territory after the Polish-Soviet [[Peace of Riga]]. On 30 December 1922, along with the [[Russian SFSR|Russian]], [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR|Transcaucasian]] republics, the Ukrainian SSR was one of the founding members of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== {{anchor|interbellum}} Interwar years: 1922\u20131939 ===<!--Do not change anchor name, a link with articles.

The first task of the Soviet authorities was to reestablish political control over the republic which had been entirely lost during the war. This was an immense task, considering the widespread human and material losses. During World War II [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union lost]] about 8.6 million combatants and around 18 million civilians, of these, 6.8 million were Ukrainian civilians and military personnel. Also, an estimated 3.9 million Ukrainians were evacuated to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] during the war, and 2.2 million Ukrainians were sent to forced labour camps by the Germans.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe material devastation was huge; [[Adolf Hitler]]'s orders to create \"a zone of annihilation\" in 1943, coupled with the Soviet military's [[scorched-earth]] policy in 1941, meant Ukraine lay in ruins. These two policies led to the destruction of 28 thousand villages and 714 cities and towns. 85 percent of [[Kiev]]'s city centre was destroyed, as was 70 percent of the city centre of the second-largest city in Ukraine, [[Kharkiv]]. Because of this, 19 million people were left homeless after the war.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=684}} The republic's industrial base, as so much else, was destroyed.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|pp=684\u2013685}} The Soviet government had managed to evacuate 544 industrial enterprises between July and November 1941, but the rapid German advance led to the destruction or the partial destruction of 16,150 enterprises. 27,910 thousand [[Collective farming|collective farms]], 1,300 machine tractor stations and 872 state farms were destroyed by the Germans.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=685}}\n\n[[File:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|The [[Curzon Line]] expanded the territory of the Ukrainian SSR to include western Ukraine, previously controlled by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]].]]\nWhile the war brought to Ukraine an enormous physical destruction, victory also led to territorial expansion.

In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]. This was part of a deal with the [[United States]] to ensure a degree of balance in the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc.

The Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] (CPU) openly criticised Stalin's russification policies in a meeting in June 1953. On 4 June 1953, [[Oleksii Kyrychenko]] succeeded [[Leonid Melnikov]] as First Secretary of the CPU; this was significant since Kyrychenko was the first ethnic Ukrainian to lead the CPU since the 1920s. The policy of de-Stalinisation took two main features, that of centralisation and decentralisation from the centre. In February 1954 the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) [[transferred Crimea]] as a gift to Ukraine from the Russians; even if only 22 percent of the Crimean population were ethnic Ukrainian.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|pp=702\u2013703}} 1954 also witnessed the massive state-organised celebration of the 300th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]]; the treaty which brought Ukraine under Russian rule three centuries before. The event was celebrated to prove the old and brotherly love between Ukrainians and Russians, and proof of the Soviet Union as a \"family of nations\"; it was also another way of legitimising [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=703}}\n\nThe [[Khrushchev Thaw|\"Thaw\"]]{{spaced ndash}}the policy of deliberate liberalisation{{spaced ndash}}was characterised by four points: amnesty for all those convicted of state crime during the war or the immediate post-war years; amnesties for one-third of those convicted of state crime during Stalin's rule; the establishment of the first Ukrainian mission to the [[United Nations]] in 1958; and the steady increase of Ukrainians in the rank of the CPU and government of the Ukrainian SSR. Not only were the majority of CPU Central Committee and Politburo members ethnic Ukrainians, three-quarters of the highest ranking party and state officials were ethnic Ukrainians too. The policy of partial [[Ukrainisation]] also led to a cultural thaw within Ukraine.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=703}}\n\nIn October 1964, Khrushchev was deposed by a joint Central Committee and Politburo plenum and succeeded by another collective leadership, this time led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], born in Ukraine, as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=708}} Brezhnev's rule would be marked by social and economic stagnation, a period often referred to as the [[Era of Stagnation]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|pp=708\u2013709}} The new regime introduced the policy of ''rastsvet'', ''sblizhenie'' and ''sliianie'' (\"flowering\", \"drawing together\" and \"merging\"/\"fusion\"), which was the policy of uniting the different Soviet nationalities into one [[Soviet people|Soviet nationality]] by merging the best elements of each nationality into the new one. This policy turned out to be, in fact, the reintroduction of the russification policy.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=709}} The reintroduction of this policy can be explained by Khrushchev's promise of [[communism in 20 years]]; the unification of Soviet nationalities would take place, according to [[Vladimir Lenin]], when the Soviet Union reached the [[Stateless communism|final stage of communism, also the final stage of human development]]. Some all-Union Soviet officials were calling for the abolition of the \"pseudosovereign\" Soviet republics, and the establishment of one nationality.

The result of the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|1991 independence referendum]] held on 1 December 1991 proved to be a surprise.  An overwhelming majority, 92.3%, voted for independence. The referendum carried in the majority of all oblasts. Notably, the [[Crimea]], which had originally been a territory of the RSFSR until 1954, supported the referendum by a 54 percent majority. Over 80 percent of the population of [[Eastern Ukraine]] voted for independence. Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union led to an almost immediate recognition from the international community.

The republic was one of 15 constituent republics composing the Soviet Union from its entry into the union in 1922 until its dissolution in 1991. All of the political power and authority in the USSR was in the hands of Communist Party authorities, with little real power being concentrated in official government bodies and organs. In such a system, lower-level authorities directly reported to higher level authorities and so on, with the bulk of the power being held at the highest echelons of the Communist Party.<ref name=eou-c>{{cite web|last=Yurchenko|first=Oleksander|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\\C\\O\\ConstitutionoftheUkrainianSovietSocialistRepublic.htm|title=Constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|work=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]|accessdate=20 April 2011|year=1984}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Akt nezalezhnosti.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Declaration of Independence]], as printed on the ballot for the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|referendum on 1 December 1991]]]]\nOriginally, the legislative authority was vested in the [[Central Executive Committee of Ukraine]] that for many years was headed by [[Grigoriy Petrovsky]].

It is, however, important to note that in 1944 the Ukrainian SSR was permitted to establish bilateral relations with countries and maintain its own standing army.<ref name=eou-c/> This clause was used to permit the republic's membership in the [[United Nations]]. Accordingly, representatives from the \"Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\" and 50 other nations founded the UN on 24 October 1945.

It was not separately a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[Comecon]], the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] and the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]], and since 1949, the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n[[File:Kharkov 1981 Vedmedik.jpg|thumb|Central [[Kharkiv]] during the 1980s]]\n{{main|Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n\nLegally, the Soviet Union and its fifteen union republics constituted a [[federal system]], but the country was functionally a highly centralised state, with all major decision-making taking place at the [[Kremlin]], the capital and seat of government of the country. The constituent republic were essentially [[unitary state]]s, with lower levels of power being directly subordinate to higher ones. Throughout its 72-year existence, the administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR changed numerous times, often incorporating regional reorganisation and annexation on the part of Soviet authorities during World War II.\n\nThe most common administrative division was the [[oblast]] (province), of which there were 25 upon the republic's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Provinces were further subdivided into [[raion]]s (districts) which numbered 490. The rest of the administrative division within the provinces consisted of cities, [[urban-type settlement]]s, and villages. Cities in the Ukrainian SSR were a separate exception, which could either be subordinate to either the provincial authorities themselves or the district authorities of which they were the administrative center. Two cities, the capital [[Kiev]], and [[Sevastopol]] in Crimea, treated separately because it housed an underground nuclear submarine base, were designated \"cities with special status.\" This meant that they were directly subordinate to the central Ukrainian SSR authorities and not the provincial authorities surrounding them.\n\n=== Historical formation ===\n[[File:Ukraine 1946-1954.png|thumb|left|The 25 [[oblast]]s of Ukraine through 1946 to 1954.

At the end of the [[World War I]] in 1918, Ukraine was invaded by the [[Soviet Russia]] as the Russian puppet government of the Ukrainian SSR and without official declaration it ignited the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]]. Government of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] from very beginning was managed by the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] that was created in [[Moscow]] and was originally formed out of the Bolshevik organisational centers in Ukraine. Occupying the eastern city of [[Kharkiv]], the Soviet forces chose it as the republic's seat of government, colloquially named in the media as \"Kharkov \u2013 Pervaya Stolitsa (the first capital)\" with implication to the era of [[Soviet regime]].<ref>{{cite web |title=My Kharkiv |url=http://www.collegium.kharkov.ua/ua/pg/kharkov/character.html |publisher=Kharkiv Collegium |accessdate=20 April 2011 |language=Ukrainian |year=2008}}</ref> Kharkiv was also the city where the first Soviet Ukrainian government was created in 1917 with strong support from Russian SFSR authorities. However, in 1934, the capital was moved from Kharkiv to [[Kiev]], which remains the capital of Ukraine today, although at first Kharkiv retained some government offices and buildings for some time after the move.\n\nDuring the 1930s, there were significant numbers of ethnic minorities living within the Ukrainian SSR. National Districts were formed as separate territorial-administrative units within higher-level provincial authorities. Districts were established for the republic's three largest minority groups, which were the [[Jews]], [[Russians]], and [[Poles]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Magocsi |first=Paul Robert |title=Ukraine, An Illustrated HIstory |year=207 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |location=Seattle |isbn=978-0-295-98723-1 |pages=229}}</ref> Other ethnic groups, however, were allowed to petition the government for their own national autonomy. In 1924 on the territory of Ukrainian SSR was formed the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Upon the 1940 conquest of Bessarabia and Bukovina by Soviet troops the Moldavian ASSR was passed to the newly formed [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]], while [[Budjak|Budzhak]] and Bukovina were secured by the Ukrainian SSR. Following the creation of the Ukrainian SSR significant numbers of ethnic Ukrainians found themselves living outside the Ukrainian SSR.<ref name=\"ukrainianweek43727\"/> In 1920s the Ukrainian SSR was forced to cede several territories to Russia in [[Severia]], [[Sloboda Ukraine]] and Azov littoral including such cities like [[Belgorod]], [[Taganrog]] and [[Starodub]]. In the 1920s the administration of the Ukrainian SSR insisted in vain on reviewing the border between the Ukrainian Soviet Republics and the [[Russian Soviet Republic]] based on the 1926 [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] that showed that 4.5 millions of Ukrainians were living on Russian territories bordering Ukraine.<ref name=\"ukrainianweek43727\">[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/43727 Unknown Eastern Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (14 March 2012)</ref> A forced end to [[Ukrainization|Ukrainisation]] in southern Russian Soviet Republic led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 Soviet Census]].<ref name=\"ukrainianweek43727\"/>\n\nUpon signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Nazi Germany and Soviet Union partitioned [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and its Eastern Borderlands were secured by the Soviet buffer republics with Ukraine securing the territory of Eastern Galicia.

Despite the human toll of [[Collectivization|Collectivisation of agriculture]] in the Soviet Union, especially in Ukraine,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Soviet planners still believed in the effectiveness of collective farming. The old system was reestablished; the numbers of [[kolkhoz|collective farm]]s in Ukraine increased from 28 thousand in 1940 to 33 thousand in 1949, comprising 45 million hectares; the numbers of [[sovkhoz|state farm]]s barely increased, standing at 935 in 1950, comprising 12.1 million hectares. By the end of the [[Fourth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Fourth Five-Year Plan]] (in 1950) and the [[Fifth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Fifth Five-Year Plan]] (in 1955), agricultural output still stood far lower than the 1940 level. The slow changes in agriculture can be explained by the low productivity in collective farms, and by bad weather-conditions, which the Soviet planning system could not effectively respond to. Grain for human consumption in the post-war years decreased, this in turn led to frequent and severe food shortages.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 693}}\n\nThe increase of [[Agriculture of the Soviet Union|Soviet agricultural production]] was tremendous, however, the [[Soviet people|Soviet]]-Ukrainians still experienced food shortages due to the inefficiencies of a [[Planned economy|highly centralised economy]]. During the peak of Soviet-Ukrainian agriculture output in the 1950s and early-to-mid-1960s, human consumption in Ukraine, and in the rest of the [[Soviet Union]], actually experienced short intervals of decrease. There are many reasons for this inefficiency, but its origins can be traced back to the single-purchaser and -producer [[market system]] set up by [[Joseph Stalin]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 706}}{{qn|date=November 2018}} Khrushchev tried to improve the agricultural situation in the Soviet Union by expanding the total crop size \u2013 for instance, in the Ukrainian SSR alone \"the amount of land planted with [[maize|corn]] grew by 600 percent\". At the height of this policy, between 1959 and 1963, one-third of Ukrainian [[arable land]] grew this crop. This policy decreased the total production of [[wheat]] and [[rye]]; Khrushchev had anticipated this, and the production of wheat and rye moved to [[Soviet Central Asia]]{{when|date=November 2018}} as part of the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]].  Khrushchev's agricultural policy failed, and in 1963 the Soviet Union had to import food from abroad. The total level of agricultural productivity in Ukraine decreased sharply during this period, but recovered in the 1970s and 1980s during [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 708}}\n\n==== Industry ====\nDuring the [[post-war]] years, Ukraine's industrial productivity doubled its pre-war level.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=705}} In 1945 industrial output totalled only 26 percent of the 1940 level. The Soviet r\u00e9gime, which still believed in the [[planned economy]], introduced the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1946. The Fourth Five-Year Plan would prove to be a remarkable success, and can be likened to the \"[[Wirtschaftswunder|wonders of West German]] and Japanese reconstruction\", but without foreign capital; the Soviet reconstruction is historically an impressive achievement. In 1950 industrial gross output had already surpassed 1940-levels. While the Soviet r\u00e9gime still emphasised [[heavy industry]] over [[light industry]], the light-industry sector also grew. The increase in capital investment and the expansion of the labour force also benefited Ukraine's economic recovery.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 692}} In the prewar years, 15.9 percent of the Soviet budget went to Ukraine, in 1950, during the Fourth Five-Year Plan this had increased to 19.3 percent. The workforce had increased from 1.2 million in 1945 to 2.9 million in 1955; a increase of 33.2 percent over the 1940-level.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 692}} The end result of this remarkable growth was that by 1955 Ukraine was producing 2.2 times more than in 1940, and the republic had become one of the leading producers of certain commodities in Europe. Ukraine was the largest per-capita producer in Europe of [[pig iron]] and [[sugar]], and the second-largest per-capita producer of steel and of [[iron ore]], and was the third largest per-capita producer of [[coal]] in Europe.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 693}}\n\n[[File:Chernobyl nuclear plant5.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] left many former plant-employees homeless.]]\nFrom 1965 until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, industrial growth in Ukraine decreased, and by the 1970s it [[Era of Stagnation|started to stagnate]]. Significant economic decline did not become apparent before the 1970s. During the [[Fifth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Fifth Five-Year Plan]] (1951\u20131955), industrial development in Ukraine grew by 13.5 percent, while during the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (1981\u20131985) industry grew by a modest 3.5 percent. The double-digit growth seen in all branches of the economy in the [[post-war]] years had disappeared by the 1980s, entirely replaced by low growth-figures. An ongoing problem throughout the republic's existence was the planners' emphasis on heavy industry over [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 705}}\n\nThe [[urbanisation]] of Ukrainian society in the post-war years led to an increase in [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. Between 1956 and 1972, to meet this increasing demand, the government built five [[water reservoir]]s along the [[Dnieper River]]. Aside from improving Soviet-Ukrainian [[water transport]], the reservoirs became the sites for new [[power stations]], and [[hydroelectric energy]] flourished in Ukraine in consequence. The [[Natural gas industry|natural-gas industry]] flourished as well, and Ukraine became the site of the first post-war production of gas in the Soviet Union; by the 1960s Ukraine's biggest gas field was producing 30 percent of the USSR's total gas production. The government was not able to meet the people's ever-increasing demand for energy consumption, but by the 1970s, the Soviet government had conceived an intensive nuclear power program. According to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government would build 8 [[nuclear power plant]]s in Ukraine by 1989. As a result of these efforts, Ukraine became highly diversified in energy consumption.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Magocsi\n | first1 = Paul Robert\n | author-link1 = Paul Robert Magocsi\n | orig-year = 1996\n | chapter = Post-Stalinist Soviet Ukraine\n | title = A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TA1zVKTTsXUC\n | edition = 2\n | location = Toronto\n | publisher = University of Toronto Press\n | publication-date = 2010\n | page = 706\n | isbn = 9781442610217\n | quote = [...] the Soviet Union launched an intensive nuclear power program in the 1970s.

From the start, the eastern city of [[Kharkiv]] served as the republic's capital. However, in 1934, the seat of government was subsequently moved to the city of [[Kiev]], Ukraine's historic capital. Kiev remained the capital for the rest of the Ukrainian SSR's existence, and remained the capital of independent Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nGeographically, the Ukrainian SSR was situated in [[Eastern Europe]] to the north of the [[Black Sea]], bordered by the Soviet republics of [[Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]], and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]. The Ukrainian SSR's border with [[Czechoslovakia]] formed the Soviet Union's western-most border point. According to the [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet Census of 1989]] the republic had a population of 51,706,746 inhabitants, which [[Demographics of Ukraine#Historical data|fell sharply]] after the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]].

It is often perceived as being derived from the Slavic word \"okraina\", meaning \"border land\". It was first used to define part of the territory of [[Kievan Rus']] ([[Ruthenia]]) in the 12th century, at which point [[Kiev]] was the capital of Rus'. The name has been used in a variety of ways since the twelfth century. For example, [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] called their [[Cossack Hetmanate|hetmanate]] \"Ukraine\".\n\nWithin the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the name carried unofficial status for eastern parts of bigger [[Kiev Voivodeship|Kyiv Voivodeship]] and was overshadowed by the more common [[Lesser Poland|Little Poland]].\n\nSince the [[partition of Poland]], the name had generally disappeared and was replaced with the Russian imposed name \"Little Russia\".\n\n\"The Ukraine\" used to be the usual form in English,<ref name=\"merriam-webster\">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ukraine |title=Ukraine \u2013 Definition |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> but since the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]], \"the Ukraine\" has become less common in the [[English-speaking world]], and style-guides warn against its use in professional writing.<ref name=UKrW812991TU>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499102.shtml |title=The \"the\" is gone |publisher=[[The Ukrainian Weekly]] |volume=LIX, No. 49 |date=8 December 1991 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Adam Taylor |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-ukraine-isnt-the-ukraine-and-why-that-matters-now-2013-12 |title=Why Ukraine Isn't 'The Ukraine,' And Why That Matters Now |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> According to U.S. ambassador [[William B.

During a period of civil war from 1917 to 1923 many factions claiming themselves governments of the newly born republic were formed, each with supporters and opponents. The two most prominent of them were a government in [[Kiev]] (called the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UPR)) and a government in [[Kharkiv]] (called the [[Ukrainian Soviet Republic]] (USR)). The Kiev-based UPR was internationally recognized and supported by the Central powers following the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereas the Kharkiv-based USR was solely supported by the Soviet Russian forces, while neither the UPR nor the USR were supported by the [[White movement|White Russian]] forces that remained.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:ZakapratskaUkraina1944.png|thumb|Front page of the Zakarpattia Ukraine newspaper (1944) with the manifest of unification with [[Soviet Ukraine]] (not the Ukrainian SSR)]]\nThe conflict between the two competing governments, known as the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]], was part of the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]], as well as a struggle for national independence, which ended with the pro-independence Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) being annexed into a new '''Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic''' ({{lang-uk|\u0423\u0421\u0420\u0420}}), western Ukraine being annexed into the [[Second Polish Republic]], and the newly stable Ukraine becoming a founding member of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe government of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was founded on 24\u201325 December 1917.

The last session of the government took place in the city of [[Taganrog]].\n\nIn July 1918, the former members of the government formed the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]], the constituent assembly of which took place in Moscow. With the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], [[Bolshevik]] Russia resumed its hostilities towards the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] fighting for Ukrainian independence and organised another Soviet government in [[Kursk]], Russia. On 10 March 1919, according to the 3rd Congress of Soviets in Ukraine (conducted 6\u201310 March 1919) the name of the state was changed to the '''Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic''' (abbreviated \"\u0423\u0421\u0420\u0420\" in Ukrainian as opposed to the later \"\u0423\u0420\u0421\u0420\").<ref name=\"knowbysight\"/>\n\nAfter the ratification of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]], the names of all Soviet republics were changed, transposing the second (\"socialist\") and third (\"soviet\" or \"radianska\" in Ukrainian) words. In accordance, on 5 December 1936, the 8th Extraordinary Congress Soviets in Soviet Union changed the name of the republic to the \"'''Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic'''\", which was ratified by the 14th Extraordinary Congress of Soviets in Ukrainian SSR on 31 January 1937.<ref name=\"knowbysight\"/>\n\nDuring its existence, the Ukrainian SSR was commonly referred to as \"the Ukraine\".\n\nOn 24 August 1991, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic declared independence and the legal name of the republic was changed to the '''Ukraine''' on 17 September 1991. Since the adoption of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] in June 1996, the country became known simply as '''[[Ukraine]]''', which is the name used to this day.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Founding: 1917\u20131922 ===\n[[File:Bolsheviks Kharkov Ukraine anrc 04262a.jpg|thumb|Bolshevik commissars in Ukraine (1919).]]\n\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Map of Ukraine for Paris Peace Conference.jpg\n| caption1 = Territories claimed by the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (1917\u20131920).\n| image2 = Europe location UkrSSR 1922.png\n| caption2 = Boundaries of the Ukrainian SSR (1922).\n}}\nAfter the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], several factions sought to create an independent Ukrainian state, alternately cooperating and struggling against each other. Numerous more or less socialist-oriented factions participated in the formation of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UPR) among which were [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Menshevik]]s, Socialists-Revolutionaries, and many others. The most popular faction was initially the local [[Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionary Party]] that composed the local government together with Federalists and Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks boycotted any government initiatives most of the time, instigating several armed riots in order to establish the Soviet power without any intent for consensus.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nImmediately after the [[October Revolution]] in [[Petrograd]], Bolsheviks instigated the [[Kiev Bolshevik Uprising]] to support the Revolution and secure Kiev. Due to a lack of adequate support from the local population and anti-revolutionary Central Rada, however, the Kiev Bolshevik group split. Most moved to [[Kharkiv]] and received the support of the eastern Ukrainian cities and industrial centers. Later, this move was regarded as a mistake by some of the [[Narkom|People's Commissars]] ([[Yevgenia Bosch]]). They issued an ultimatum to the [[Central Rada]] on 17 December to recognise the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] of which the Rada was very critical. The Bolsheviks convened a separate congress and declared the first Soviet Republic of Ukraine on 24 December 1917 claiming the [[Central Rada]] and its supporters outlaws that need to be eradicated. Warfare ensued against the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) for the installation of the Soviet regime in the country and with the direct support from [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] the Ukrainian National forces were practically overran. The government of Ukraine appealed to foreign capitalists, finding the support in the face of the Central Powers as the others refused to recognise it. After the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the [[Russian SFSR]] yielded all the captured Ukrainian territory as the Bolsheviks were forced out of Ukraine. The government of the Soviet Ukraine was dissolved after its last session on 20 November 1918.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAfter re-taking Kharkiv in February 1919, a second Soviet Ukrainian government was formed, consisting mostly of Russians, Jews, and non-Ukrainians. The government enforced Russian policies that did not adhere to local needs. 3,000 workers were dispatched from Russia to take grain from local farms by force if necessary to feed Russian cities, and were met with resistance. The Ukrainian language was also censured from administrative and educational use. Eventually fighting both White forces in the east and republic forces in the west, Lenin ordered the liquidation of the second Soviet Ukrainian government in August 1919.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Subtelny|first1=Orest|title=Ukraine: A History|page=365|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=l5uiWHgRphQC&pg=PA475&dq=soviet+partisans+western+ukraine&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR5IPEjuTLAhVBlxoKHUuhAcsQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=365&f=false}}</ref>\n\nEventually, after the creation of the [[Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine]] in Moscow, a third Ukrainian Soviet government was formed on 21 December 1919 that initiated new hostilities against Ukrainian nationalists as they lost their military support from the defeated Central Powers. Eventually, the [[Red Army]] ended up controlling much of the Ukrainian territory after the Polish-Soviet [[Peace of Riga]]. On 30 December 1922, along with the [[Russian SFSR|Russian]], [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian]], and [[Transcaucasian SFSR|Transcaucasian]] republics, the Ukrainian SSR was one of the founding members of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== {{anchor|interbellum}} Interwar years: 1922\u20131939 ===<!--Do not change anchor name, a link with articles.

The first task of the Soviet authorities was to reestablish political control over the republic which had been entirely lost during the war. This was an immense task, considering the widespread human and material losses. During World War II [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union lost]] about 8.6 million combatants and around 18 million civilians, of these, 6.8 million were Ukrainian civilians and military personnel. Also, an estimated 3.9 million Ukrainians were evacuated to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] during the war, and 2.2 million Ukrainians were sent to forced labour camps by the Germans.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe material devastation was huge; [[Adolf Hitler]]'s orders to create \"a zone of annihilation\" in 1943, coupled with the Soviet military's [[scorched-earth]] policy in 1941, meant Ukraine lay in ruins. These two policies led to the destruction of 28 thousand villages and 714 cities and towns. 85 percent of [[Kiev]]'s city centre was destroyed, as was 70 percent of the city centre of the second-largest city in Ukraine, [[Kharkiv]]. Because of this, 19 million people were left homeless after the war.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=684}} The republic's industrial base, as so much else, was destroyed.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|pp=684\u2013685}} The Soviet government had managed to evacuate 544 industrial enterprises between July and November 1941, but the rapid German advance led to the destruction or the partial destruction of 16,150 enterprises. 27,910 thousand [[Collective farming|collective farms]], 1,300 machine tractor stations and 872 state farms were destroyed by the Germans.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=685}}\n\n[[File:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|The [[Curzon Line]] expanded the territory of the Ukrainian SSR to include western Ukraine, previously controlled by [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]].]]\nWhile the war brought to Ukraine an enormous physical destruction, victory also led to territorial expansion.

In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]].

The Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] (CPU) openly criticised Stalin's russification policies in a meeting in June 1953. On 4 June 1953, [[Oleksii Kyrychenko]] succeeded [[Leonid Melnikov]] as First Secretary of the CPU; this was significant since Kyrychenko was the first ethnic Ukrainian to lead the CPU since the 1920s. The policy of de-Stalinisation took two main features, that of centralisation and decentralisation from the centre. In February 1954 the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) [[transferred Crimea]] as a gift to Ukraine from the Russians; even if only 22 percent of the Crimean population were ethnic Ukrainian.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|pp=702\u2013703}} 1954 also witnessed the massive state-organised celebration of the 300th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]]; the treaty which brought Ukraine under Russian rule three centuries before. The event was celebrated to prove the old and brotherly love between Ukrainians and Russians, and proof of the Soviet Union as a \"family of nations\"; it was also another way of legitimising [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=703}}\n\nThe [[Khrushchev Thaw|\"Thaw\"]]{{spaced ndash}}the policy of deliberate liberalisation{{spaced ndash}}was characterised by four points: amnesty for all those convicted of state crime during the war or the immediate post-war years; amnesties for one-third of those convicted of state crime during Stalin's rule; the establishment of the first Ukrainian mission to the [[United Nations]] in 1958; and the steady increase of Ukrainians in the rank of the CPU and government of the Ukrainian SSR. Not only were the majority of CPU Central Committee and Politburo members ethnic Ukrainians, three-quarters of the highest ranking party and state officials were ethnic Ukrainians too. The policy of partial [[Ukrainisation]] also led to a cultural thaw within Ukraine.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=703}}\n\nIn October 1964, Khrushchev was deposed by a joint Central Committee and Politburo plenum and succeeded by another collective leadership, this time led by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], born in Ukraine, as First Secretary and [[Alexei Kosygin]] as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=708}} Brezhnev's rule would be marked by social and economic stagnation, a period often referred to as the [[Era of Stagnation]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|pp=708\u2013709}} The new regime introduced the policy of ''rastsvet'', ''sblizhenie'' and ''sliianie'' (\"flowering\", \"drawing together\" and \"merging\"/\"fusion\"), which was the policy of uniting the different Soviet nationalities into one [[Soviet people|Soviet nationality]] by merging the best elements of each nationality into the new one. This policy turned out to be, in fact, the reintroduction of the russification policy.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=709}} The reintroduction of this policy can be explained by Khrushchev's promise of [[communism in 20 years]]; the unification of Soviet nationalities would take place, according to [[Vladimir Lenin]], when the Soviet Union reached the [[Stateless communism|final stage of communism, also the final stage of human development]]. Some all-Union Soviet officials were calling for the abolition of the \"pseudosovereign\" Soviet republics, and the establishment of one nationality.

The result of the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|1991 independence referendum]] held on 1 December 1991 proved to be a surprise.  An overwhelming majority, 92.3%, voted for independence. The referendum carried in the majority of all oblasts. Notably, the [[Crimea]], which had originally been a territory of the RSFSR until 1954, supported the referendum by a 54 percent majority. Over 80 percent of the population of [[Eastern Ukraine]] voted for independence. Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union led to an almost immediate recognition from the international community.

The republic was one of 15 constituent republics composing the Soviet Union from its entry into the union in 1922 until its dissolution in 1991. All of the political power and authority in the USSR was in the hands of Communist Party authorities, with little real power being concentrated in official government bodies and organs. In such a system, lower-level authorities directly reported to higher level authorities and so on, with the bulk of the power being held at the highest echelons of the Communist Party.<ref name=eou-c>{{cite web|last=Yurchenko|first=Oleksander|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\\C\\O\\ConstitutionoftheUkrainianSovietSocialistRepublic.htm|title=Constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|work=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]|accessdate=20 April 2011|year=1984}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Akt nezalezhnosti.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Declaration of Independence]], as printed on the ballot for the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|referendum on 1 December 1991]]]]\nOriginally, the legislative authority was vested in the [[Central Executive Committee of Ukraine]] that for many years was headed by [[Grigoriy Petrovsky]].

It is, however, important to note that in 1944 the Ukrainian SSR was permitted to establish bilateral relations with countries and maintain its own standing army.<ref name=eou-c/> This clause was used to permit the republic's membership in the [[United Nations]]. Accordingly, representatives from the \"Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\" and 50 other nations founded the UN on 24 October 1945.

It was not separately a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], [[Comecon]], the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] and the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]], and since 1949, the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n[[File:Kharkov 1981 Vedmedik.jpg|thumb|Central [[Kharkiv]] during the 1980s]]\n{{main|Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n\nLegally, the Soviet Union and its fifteen union republics constituted a [[federal system]], but the country was functionally a highly centralised state, with all major decision-making taking place at the [[Kremlin]], the capital and seat of government of the country. The constituent republic were essentially [[unitary state]]s, with lower levels of power being directly subordinate to higher ones. Throughout its 72-year existence, the administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR changed numerous times, often incorporating regional reorganisation and annexation on the part of Soviet authorities during World War II.\n\nThe most common administrative division was the [[oblast]] (province), of which there were 25 upon the republic's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Provinces were further subdivided into [[raion]]s (districts) which numbered 490. The rest of the administrative division within the provinces consisted of cities, [[urban-type settlement]]s, and villages. Cities in the Ukrainian SSR were a separate exception, which could either be subordinate to either the provincial authorities themselves or the district authorities of which they were the administrative center. Two cities, the capital [[Kiev]], and [[Sevastopol]] in Crimea, treated separately because it housed an underground nuclear submarine base, were designated \"cities with special status.\" This meant that they were directly subordinate to the central Ukrainian SSR authorities and not the provincial authorities surrounding them.\n\n=== Historical formation ===\n[[File:Ukraine 1946-1954.png|thumb|left|The 25 [[oblast]]s of Ukraine through 1946 to 1954.

At the end of the [[World War I]] in 1918, Ukraine was invaded by the [[Soviet Russia]] as the Russian puppet government of the Ukrainian SSR and without official declaration it ignited the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]]. Government of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] from very beginning was managed by the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] that was created in [[Moscow]] and was originally formed out of the Bolshevik organisational centers in Ukraine. Occupying the eastern city of [[Kharkiv]], the Soviet forces chose it as the republic's seat of government, colloquially named in the media as \"Kharkov \u2013 Pervaya Stolitsa (the first capital)\" with implication to the era of [[Soviet regime]].<ref>{{cite web |title=My Kharkiv |url=http://www.collegium.kharkov.ua/ua/pg/kharkov/character.html |publisher=Kharkiv Collegium |accessdate=20 April 2011 |language=Ukrainian |year=2008}}</ref> Kharkiv was also the city where the first Soviet Ukrainian government was created in 1917 with strong support from Russian SFSR authorities. However, in 1934, the capital was moved from Kharkiv to [[Kiev]], which remains the capital of Ukraine today, although at first Kharkiv retained some government offices and buildings for some time after the move.\n\nDuring the 1930s, there were significant numbers of ethnic minorities living within the Ukrainian SSR. National Districts were formed as separate territorial-administrative units within higher-level provincial authorities. Districts were established for the republic's three largest minority groups, which were the [[Jews]], [[Russians]], and [[Poles]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Magocsi |first=Paul Robert |title=Ukraine, An Illustrated HIstory |year=207 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |location=Seattle |isbn=978-0-295-98723-1 |pages=229}}</ref> Other ethnic groups, however, were allowed to petition the government for their own national autonomy. In 1924 on the territory of Ukrainian SSR was formed the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Upon the 1940 conquest of Bessarabia and Bukovina by Soviet troops the Moldavian ASSR was passed to the newly formed [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]], while [[Budjak|Budzhak]] and Bukovina were secured by the Ukrainian SSR. Following the creation of the Ukrainian SSR significant numbers of ethnic Ukrainians found themselves living outside the Ukrainian SSR.<ref name=\"ukrainianweek43727\"/> In 1920s the Ukrainian SSR was forced to cede several territories to Russia in [[Severia]], [[Sloboda Ukraine]] and Azov littoral including such cities like [[Belgorod]], [[Taganrog]] and [[Starodub]]. In the 1920s the administration of the Ukrainian SSR insisted in vain on reviewing the border between the Ukrainian Soviet Republics and the [[Russian Soviet Republic]] based on the 1926 [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] that showed that 4.5 millions of Ukrainians were living on Russian territories bordering Ukraine.<ref name=\"ukrainianweek43727\">[http://ukrainianweek.com/History/43727 Unknown Eastern Ukraine], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (14 March 2012)</ref> A forced end to [[Ukrainization|Ukrainisation]] in southern Russian Soviet Republic led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the [[Soviet Census (1937)|1937 Soviet Census]].<ref name=\"ukrainianweek43727\"/>\n\nUpon signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Nazi Germany and Soviet Union partitioned [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and its Eastern Borderlands were secured by the Soviet buffer republics with Ukraine securing the territory of Eastern Galicia.

Despite the human toll of [[Collectivization|Collectivisation of agriculture]] in the Soviet Union, especially in Ukraine,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Soviet planners still believed in the effectiveness of collective farming. The old system was reestablished; the numbers of [[kolkhoz|collective farm]]s in Ukraine increased from 28 thousand in 1940 to 33 thousand in 1949, comprising 45 million hectares; the numbers of [[sovkhoz|state farm]]s barely increased, standing at 935 in 1950, comprising 12.1 million hectares. By the end of the [[Fourth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Fourth Five-Year Plan]] (in 1950) and the [[Fifth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Fifth Five-Year Plan]] (in 1955), agricultural output still stood far lower than the 1940 level. The slow changes in agriculture can be explained by the low productivity in collective farms, and by bad weather-conditions, which the Soviet planning system could not effectively respond to. Grain for human consumption in the post-war years decreased, this in turn led to frequent and severe food shortages.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 693}}\n\nThe increase of [[Agriculture of the Soviet Union|Soviet agricultural production]] was tremendous, however, the [[Soviet people|Soviet]]-Ukrainians still experienced food shortages due to the inefficiencies of a [[Planned economy|highly centralised economy]]. During the peak of Soviet-Ukrainian agriculture output in the 1950s and early-to-mid-1960s, human consumption in Ukraine, and in the rest of the [[Soviet Union]], actually experienced short intervals of decrease. There are many reasons for this inefficiency, but its origins can be traced back to the single-purchaser and -producer [[market system]] set up by [[Joseph Stalin]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 706}}{{qn|date=November 2018}} Khrushchev tried to improve the agricultural situation in the Soviet Union by expanding the total crop size \u2013 for instance, in the Ukrainian SSR alone \"the amount of land planted with [[maize|corn]] grew by 600 percent\". At the height of this policy, between 1959 and 1963, one-third of Ukrainian [[arable land]] grew this crop. This policy decreased the total production of [[wheat]] and [[rye]]; Khrushchev had anticipated this, and the production of wheat and rye moved to [[Soviet Central Asia]]{{when|date=November 2018}} as part of the [[Virgin Lands Campaign]].  Khrushchev's agricultural policy failed, and in 1963 the Soviet Union had to import food from abroad. The total level of agricultural productivity in Ukraine decreased sharply during this period, but recovered in the 1970s and 1980s during [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 708}}\n\n==== Industry ====\nDuring the [[post-war]] years, Ukraine's industrial productivity doubled its pre-war level.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p=705}} In 1945 industrial output totalled only 26 percent of the 1940 level. The Soviet r\u00e9gime, which still believed in the [[planned economy]], introduced the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1946. The Fourth Five-Year Plan would prove to be a remarkable success, and can be likened to the \"[[Wirtschaftswunder|wonders of West German]] and Japanese reconstruction\", but without foreign capital; the Soviet reconstruction is historically an impressive achievement. In 1950 industrial gross output had already surpassed 1940-levels. While the Soviet r\u00e9gime still emphasised [[heavy industry]] over [[light industry]], the light-industry sector also grew. The increase in capital investment and the expansion of the labour force also benefited Ukraine's economic recovery.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 692}} In the prewar years, 15.9 percent of the Soviet budget went to Ukraine, in 1950, during the Fourth Five-Year Plan this had increased to 19.3 percent. The workforce had increased from 1.2 million in 1945 to 2.9 million in 1955; a increase of 33.2 percent over the 1940-level.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 692}} The end result of this remarkable growth was that by 1955 Ukraine was producing 2.2 times more than in 1940, and the republic had become one of the leading producers of certain commodities in Europe. Ukraine was the largest per-capita producer in Europe of [[pig iron]] and [[sugar]], and the second-largest per-capita producer of steel and of [[iron ore]], and was the third largest per-capita producer of [[coal]] in Europe.{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 693}}\n\n[[File:Chernobyl nuclear plant5.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] left many former plant-employees homeless.]]\nFrom 1965 until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, industrial growth in Ukraine decreased, and by the 1970s it [[Era of Stagnation|started to stagnate]]. Significant economic decline did not become apparent before the 1970s. During the [[Fifth Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Fifth Five-Year Plan]] (1951\u20131955), industrial development in Ukraine grew by 13.5 percent, while during the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (Soviet Union)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] (1981\u20131985) industry grew by a modest 3.5 percent. The double-digit growth seen in all branches of the economy in the [[post-war]] years had disappeared by the 1980s, entirely replaced by low growth-figures. An ongoing problem throughout the republic's existence was the planners' emphasis on heavy industry over [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]].{{sfn|Magocsi|1996|p= 705}}\n\nThe [[urbanisation]] of Ukrainian society in the post-war years led to an increase in [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]]. Between 1956 and 1972, to meet this increasing demand, the government built five [[water reservoir]]s along the [[Dnieper River]]. Aside from improving Soviet-Ukrainian [[water transport]], the reservoirs became the sites for new [[power stations]], and [[hydroelectric energy]] flourished in Ukraine in consequence. The [[Natural gas industry|natural-gas industry]] flourished as well, and Ukraine became the site of the first post-war production of gas in the Soviet Union; by the 1960s Ukraine's biggest gas field was producing 30 percent of the USSR's total gas production. The government was not able to meet the people's ever-increasing demand for energy consumption, but by the 1970s, the Soviet government had conceived an intensive nuclear power program. According to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government would build 8 [[nuclear power plant]]s in Ukraine by 1989. As a result of these efforts, Ukraine became highly diversified in energy consumption.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Magocsi\n | first1 = Paul Robert\n | author-link1 = Paul Robert Magocsi\n | orig-year = 1996\n | chapter = Post-Stalinist Soviet Ukraine\n | title = A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TA1zVKTTsXUC\n | edition = 2\n | location = Toronto\n | publisher = University of Toronto Press\n | publication-date = 2010\n | page = 706\n | isbn = 9781442610217\n | quote = [...] the Soviet Union launched an intensive nuclear power program in the 1970s.

It was part of a mixed-use complex that includes the hotel [[Novotel|Novotel Clarke Quay]] (formerly Hotel New Otani) and Somerset Residences.\n\n==History==\nDeveloped by the Wuthelam Group in collaboration with Daimaru Inc, Liang Court opened in January 1984 as the first major shopping mall along River Valley Road. At that time of opening, it had Japanese department store and supermarket chain Daimaru, lifestyle bookstore Kinokuniya, Taiwanese restaurant Shin Yeh, karaoke chain Party World, consumer electronics chain SAFE Superstore and more than 60 speciality tenants mostly catering to Japanese expatriates. Above Liang Court were two 25-storey tower blocks occupied by Hotel New Otani Singapore and serviced apartment Somerset Liang Court, which opened in November 1984. In 2000, Rainforest Cafe opened in the lower floors but was closed in 2004 due to declining patronage.\n\nIn 2003, Daimaru closed down due to declining sales and restructuring. Its supermarket section was taken over by Meidi-Ya and department store section taken over by electronics chain Audio House and smaller shops. Hotel New Otani's management was taken over by Accor Hotels in December 2004, and was subsequently renamed Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay. The mall changed hands twice, having been sold to Pidemco Land in 1999 and subsequently sold to the Asia Retail Management Fund in 2006.\n\nUnder ARMF management, the mall underwent major refurbishment works in 2007, coupled with a repositioning of its image. The space once taken up by Daimaru was reconfigured into smaller shops, and Audio House was relocated to Level 4. The basement shops were replaced by Japanese restaurants and shops catering to Japanese expatriates. Refurbishment works were completed in 2010.\n\nUniqlo opened at the mall's ground floor in November 2013. In August 2016, Audio House closed down its only mall-based store. Following declining business, the mall was sold to a joint venture between CapitaLand and City Developments Limited in March 2019. Kinokuniya closed its store in April 2019, following the end of its 32-year lease, with various shops and restaurants following suit by the end of that year.\n\n===Redevelopment===\nIn November 2019, CapitaLand and its subsidiary [[The Ascott Limited|Ascott REIT]], along with City Developments Limited announced that Liang Court will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, integrated development featuring two residential towers with 700 condo units, a retail mall, a hotel managed by [[Marriott International]] under the Moxy brand and a 192-unit Somerset serviced residence. The new development is expected to open in phases from 2024, with the Moxy Hotel opening in 2025. All remaining tenants vacated by 31 March, with the majority relocating to the nearby refurbished Great World City.

Its supermarket section was taken over by Meidi-Ya and department store section taken over by electronics chain Audio House and smaller shops. Hotel New Otani's management was taken over by Accor Hotels in December 2004, and was subsequently renamed Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay. The mall changed hands twice, having been sold to Pidemco Land in 1999 and subsequently sold to the Asia Retail Management Fund in 2006.\n\nUnder ARMF management, the mall underwent major refurbishment works in 2007, coupled with a repositioning of its image. The space once taken up by Daimaru was reconfigured into smaller shops, and Audio House was relocated to Level 4. The basement shops were replaced by Japanese restaurants and shops catering to Japanese expatriates. Refurbishment works were completed in 2010.\n\nUniqlo opened at the mall's ground floor in November 2013. In August 2016, Audio House closed down its only mall-based store. Following declining business, the mall was sold to a joint venture between CapitaLand and City Developments Limited in March 2019. Kinokuniya closed its store in April 2019, following the end of its 32-year lease, with various shops and restaurants following suit by the end of that year.\n\n===Redevelopment===\nIn November 2019, CapitaLand and its subsidiary [[The Ascott Limited|Ascott REIT]], along with City Developments Limited announced that Liang Court will be redeveloped into a mixed-use, integrated development featuring two residential towers with 700 condo units, a retail mall, a hotel managed by [[Marriott International]] under the Moxy brand and a 192-unit Somerset serviced residence. The new development is expected to open in phases from 2024, with the Moxy Hotel opening in 2025. All remaining tenants vacated by 31 March, with the majority relocating to the nearby refurbished Great World City. Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay will cease operations from 2 April.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=21 November 2019 | url=https://www.capitaland.com/international/en/about-capitaland/newsroom/news-releases/international/2019/nov/ascott-residence-trust-joins-cdl-capitaLand-consortium-to-redevelop-liang-court-site-with-partial-sale-of-its-gfa-for-sgd-163-3-million.html | title=Ascott Residence Trust joins CDL-CapitaLand Consortium to redevelop Liang Court site | language=en | website=CapitaLand}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of shopping malls in Singapore]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n\n{{Singapore malls}}\n\n[[Category:1984 establishments in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2020 disestablishments in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Shopping malls in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Singapore River]]\n", "name_user": "TheGreatSG'rean", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Court"}
