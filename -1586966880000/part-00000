But, the system became decadent as it missed the advancements that were taking place in Europe during and after the [[Renaissance]], resulting in serious educational backwardness. Corrective measures were initiated by the British administration for making liberal, universal education available in this area through a network of schools to university system on the European pattern. [[File:Stamp featureing spread education.jpg|thumb|Stamp Issued by Department of Education, Government of United Province, British India, 1940]]  However, a real turning point came due to the efforts of educationalists like Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malviya]] and [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]], who championed the cause of learning and supported British efforts to spread it.\n\nskillshop technologies also providing technical knowledge in school.\n[[File:Au science faculty.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Allahabad University]], established 1887]]\n\n===Post-independence===\n[[File:BHU Entrance.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Statue of Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] at the entrance of [[Banaras Hindu University]], established 1916]]\nAfter independence, the state of U.P. has continued to make investment over the years in all sectors of education and has achieved significant success in overcoming general educational backwardness and illiteracy. The increase in overall literacy rate is due to persistent multi-pronged efforts made by the state government: to enrol and retain children, specially of weaker sections, in schools; to effectively implement the adult education programmes; and to establish centres of higher education. As a result, U.P. is ranked amongst the first few States to have successfully implemented the ''Education For All'' policy. The following is indicative of the gradual progress:\n\nIn 1981, the literacy rate in U.P. was 28% and it increased to 42% in 1991. In 1991, the adult literacy rate (per cent literates among those aged 15 and above) was 38% and increased to 49% in 1998, an increase of 11 per centage in the seven-year period. But, the differential between female and male literacy remained high: while in 1991, male literacy was 56% and female literacy 25%, eight years later in 1999, as per survey estimates, the male literacy became 73% and female literacy 43% (NFHS II).\n\nOne more notable feature in the state has been the persistence of higher levels of illiteracy in the younger age group, more so in females, especially in the rural areas. In the late 1980s, the incidence of illiteracy in the 10\u201314 age group was as high as 32% for rural males and 61% for rural females; and more than two-thirds of all rural girls in the 12\u201314 age group never went to school. Only 25% of the girls in 7+ age group were able to read and write in 1991 and this figure went down to 19% for rural areas: it was 11% for the scheduled castes, 8% for scheduled castes in rural areas and 8% for the entire rural population in the most educationally backward districts. In terms of completion of basic or essential educational attainment (the primary or the secondary education), in 1992\u20131993, only 50% of literate males and 40% of literate females could complete the cycle of eight years of schooling (the primary and middle stages). Possibly, [[Bihar]] is the only state in India which lags behind U.P. in education.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe problems of state's education system are complex. Due to public apathy the public schools are run inefficiently. Privately run schools (including those run by Christian missionaries) are functional, but expensive and so beyond the reach of ordinary people.\n\nIn order to make the population totally literate, steps are being taken by the government to involve public participation, including the help of NGOs and other organisations. There are also special programmes, like the [[World Bank]] aided DPEP. As a result, progress in adult education has been made and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090119205740/http://upgov.nic.in/upinfo/census01/cen01-5.htm census] of 2001 indicates a male literacy rate of 70.23% and a female literacy rate of 42.98%.\n\nPresently, there are 866,361 primary schools, 8,459 higher secondary schools, 758 degree colleges and 26 universities in the state. Some of the oldest educational institutions \u2013 founded by the British, the pioneer educationalists and other social/religious reformers \u2013 are still functional. In addition, a number of highly competitive ivy league centres of higher or technical education have been established since Independence.\n\n==Higher education==\nConsidering the size of Uttar Pradesh, it is not surprising that it has a [[List of educational institutions of Uttar Pradesh|large number]] of academic and research institutes. These institutes are either under the jurisdiction of the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh|State Government]], the [[Government of India|Central Government]], or are privately run. The state has two [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]] \u2013 at [[IIT Kanpur|Kanpur]] and [[IIT (BHU) Varanasi|Varanasi]], an [[IIM Lucknow|IIM]] at Lucknow, an [[Lucknow University|LU]] at Lucknow, an [[Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology|NIT]] and an [[Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad|IIIT]] at [[Allahabad]]. A good number of State and Central Government universities are founded in Uttar Pradesh to provide Higher Education in various course works.\n\nThe [[Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology]]: The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOP&NG), Government of India set up the institute at Jais, Rae Bareli district, Uttar Pradesh through an Act of Parliament.

The Institute is associated with leading International Universities/Institutions specializing in the domain of Petroleum Technology.\n\nAlongside above mentioned institutes of higher learning, in Uttar Pradesh, a range of Government Degree College has been set up by the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] for providing Higher Education to scholars who are interested in different course work (undergraduate, postgraduate and research) and program ([[Humanities]], Science and Commerce) in higher studies.

But, the system became decadent as it missed the advancements that were taking place in Europe during and after the [[Renaissance]], resulting in serious educational backwardness. Corrective measures were initiated by the British administration for making liberal, universal education available in this area through a network of schools to university system on the European pattern. [[File:Stamp featureing spread education.jpg|thumb|Stamp Issued by Department of Education, Government of United Province, British India, 1940]]  However, a real turning point came due to the efforts of educationalists like Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malviya]] and [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]], who championed the cause of learning and supported British efforts to spread it.\n\nskillshop technologies also providing technical knowledge in school.\n[[File:Au science faculty.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Allahabad University]], established 1887]]\n\n===Post-independence===\n[[File:BHU Entrance.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Statue of Pandit [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] at the entrance of [[Banaras Hindu University]], established 1916]]\nAfter independence, the state of U.P. has continued to make investment over the years in all sectors of education and has achieved significant success in overcoming general educational backwardness and illiteracy. The increase in overall literacy rate is due to persistent multi-pronged efforts made by the state government: to enrol and retain children, specially of weaker sections, in schools; to effectively implement the adult education programmes; and to establish centres of higher education. As a result, U.P. is ranked amongst the first few States to have successfully implemented the ''Education For All'' policy. The following is indicative of the gradual progress:\n\nIn 1981, the literacy rate in U.P. was 28% and it increased to 42% in 1991. In 1991, the adult literacy rate (per cent literates among those aged 15 and above) was 38% and increased to 49% in 1998, an increase of 11 per centage in the seven-year period. But, the differential between female and male literacy remained high: while in 1991, male literacy was 56% and female literacy 25%, eight years later in 1999, as per survey estimates, the male literacy became 73% and female literacy 43% (NFHS II).\n\nOne more notable feature in the state has been the persistence of higher levels of illiteracy in the younger age group, more so in females, especially in the rural areas. In the late 1980s, the incidence of illiteracy in the 10\u201314 age group was as high as 32% for rural males and 61% for rural females; and more than two-thirds of all rural girls in the 12\u201314 age group never went to school. Only 25% of the girls in 7+ age group were able to read and write in 1991 and this figure went down to 19% for rural areas: it was 11% for the scheduled castes, 8% for scheduled castes in rural areas and 8% for the entire rural population in the most educationally backward districts. In terms of completion of basic or essential educational attainment (the primary or the secondary education), in 1992\u20131993, only 50% of literate males and 40% of literate females could complete the cycle of eight years of schooling (the primary and middle stages). Possibly, [[Bihar]] is the only state in India which lags behind U.P. in education.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe problems of state's education system are complex. Due to public apathy the public schools are run inefficiently. Privately run schools (including those run by Christian missionaries) are functional, but expensive and so beyond the reach of ordinary people.\n\nIn order to make the population totally literate, steps are being taken by the government to involve public participation, including the help of NGOs and other organisations. There are also special programmes, like the [[World Bank]] aided DPEP. As a result, progress in adult education has been made and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090119205740/http://upgov.nic.in/upinfo/census01/cen01-5.htm census] of 2001 indicates a male literacy rate of 70.23% and a female literacy rate of 42.98%.\n\nPresently, there are 866,361 primary schools, 8,459 higher secondary schools, 758 degree colleges and 26 universities in the state. Some of the oldest educational institutions \u2013 founded by the British, the pioneer educationalists and other social/religious reformers \u2013 are still functional. In addition, a number of highly competitive ivy league centres of higher or technical education have been established since Independence.\n\n==Higher education==\nConsidering the size of Uttar Pradesh, it is not surprising that it has a [[List of educational institutions of Uttar Pradesh|large number]] of academic and research institutes. These institutes are either under the jurisdiction of the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh|State Government]], the [[Government of India|Central Government]], or are privately run. The state has two [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]] \u2013 at [[IIT Kanpur|Kanpur]] and [[IIT (BHU) Varanasi|Varanasi]], an [[IIM Lucknow|IIM]] at Lucknow, an [[Lucknow University|LU]] at Lucknow, an [[Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology|NIT]] and an [[Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad|IIIT]] at [[Allahabad]].

The longest and heaviest SUV ever to enter mass production, the Excursion was marketed as a direct competitor of the 2500-series (<big>\u00be</big>-ton) [[Chevrolet Suburban#Ninth generation (2000\u20132006)|Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL]]<ref>{{cite journal|date=November 1999|editor-last=McCosh|editor-first=Dan|title=Big, bigger, biggest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet|journal=Popular Science|volume=255|issue=5|page=48|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />  Introduced for the 2000 model year, a single generation was produced through the 2005 model year (a short 2006 production run was made for Mexico).     \n\nDerived from the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck, the Ford Excursion was marketed primarily in North America; a limited number were sold for export.  Following the discontinuation of the Excursion, Ford introduced the extended-length [[Ford Expedition#Expedition EL/Max|Ford Expedition EL/MAX]]; while matching the Chevrolet Suburban in terms of size, the Expedition EL/MAX shifted its chassis commonality from the Super Duty to the F-150.  As of current production, Ford has not produced another SUV derived from the Super Duty model line.  \n\nThroughout its production, the Ford Excursion was assembled at the [[Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] alongside Super Duty pickup trucks; the final example was produced on September 30, 2005.\n\n==Origin==\nFor 1978, Ford introduced the second-generation [[Ford Bronco#Second generation (1978\u20131979)|Ford Bronco]].  To compete directly against the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy]] and [[Dodge Ramcharger]], the Bronco became a full-size SUV, adopting the chassis and powertrain of the F-100 pickup truck (lowering its production costs); continuing the most popular design of its predecessor, the second-generation Bronco was produced strictly as a three-door wagon (with a lift-off hardtop).      \n\nAfter the 1975 discontinuation of the [[International Harvester Travelall]], the Suburban became the sole full-size SUV produced in a four-door bodystyle (far larger than the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]]).  During the 1980s and early 1990s, four-door Broncos were developed; in place of production vehicles, a limited number of license-built conversions (mating a Bronco body with F-Series crew cabs) were sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-ford-classic-350-centurion-vehicles-creates-a-frankenstein-suburban-fighter/|title=Curbside Classic: Ford Classic 350 \u2013 Centurion Vehicles Creates A Frankenstein Suburban Fighter|last=Snitkoff|first=Edward|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228070650/http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|title=This is the 4-Door Ford Bronco You Didn\u2019t Know Existed|date=2016-02-28|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>  Ford produced its first four-door SUV for 1991, as the [[Ford Explorer#First generation (1991\u20131994)|Ford Explorer]] replaced the [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]; both model lines were derived from the compact [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ranger]] pickup truck.     \n\nFor 1997, the Ford Bronco was replaced by the [[Ford Expedition]]; coinciding with changing segment demands, the Expedition was offered solely as a five-door wagon.  While changing its body configuration, the Expedition retained model commonality with the F-Series with its Bronco predecessor.  Sized between the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and Suburban, the Expedition was fitted with three-row seating (offered by the Suburban).        \n\nFor 1999, Ford expanded the F-Series model range, with the F-250 and F-350 becoming the Super Duty series.  Intended for work usage and towing, Super Duty F-Series trucks received a heavier-duty chassis and suspension along with a distinct body design.  To compete against the 2500-series Suburban, Ford began development of a heavy-duty SUV derived from the F-250 Super Duty pickup truck.     \n\n==Design overview==\n\n===Chassis===\nThe Ford Excursion was produced sharing the platform architecture of the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck. Sharing quite a bit of its chassis components and dimensions with the F-250 Super Cab, 8' Bed. The Excursion shares a common width, wheelbase, and front/rear track width with its F-250 counterpart. Other shared assemblies include the front and most of the rear suspension (the leaf springs and front spring hanger bracket were specific to the Excursion), along with the steering gear. From where the front sway bar mounts to the frame, back,is specific to the Excursion. And from this point back the frame is a little taller and much wider than its F-250 cousin.  The rear axle for all Excursions was a [[Sterling 10.5 axle]]. The [[four wheel drive]] models were equipped with a NV273 [[transfer case]] and [[Dana 50]] front axle. Gear ratios of 3:73 and 4:30 were offered.\n\nDuring the development of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]]) to become severely overridden in a head-on collision. In the test, the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus (reducing the chance of survival for its driver).<ref name=\"bradsher\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad|url-access=registration|title=High and mighty: the dangerous rise of the SUV|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58648-203-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad/page/199 199]|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper \"blocker beam\"; the device was initially tested by the French transportation ministry in 1971.<ref name=\"bradsher\" /> For the rear of the chassis, Ford chose to include a trailer hitch as standard equipment in production to reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.\n\n==== Powertrain ====\nDuring its entire production, the Excursion was offered with both gasoline and diesel engines.  The standard engine was a 5.4L Triton V8 with a 6.8L V10 offered as an option.  At its launch, the optional diesel engine was the Navistar-produced 7.3L Powerstroke V8; a 6.0L V8 was introduced during 2003, retaining the Powerstroke name.\n\nAll four engines were paired with an automatic transmission.  The 4-speed 4R100 automatic was fitted to the 5.4., 6.8, and 7.3L engines, with a 5-speed 5R110W automatic fitted to the 6.0L engine.  \n\nThough using the <big>\u00be</big>-ton chassis of the F-250, the Excursion was rated with a [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] of {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} when equipped with gasoline engines and {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} with equipped with diesel engines.  As its GVWR was above {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on|}}, the Excursion was exempt from EPA fuel economy ratings; reviewers cited fuel economy in the range of 12-15mpg with the V10 gasoline engine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2000/lweitzman_ford_excursion_2000.html |title=The Ford Excursion, It doesn't get any Bigger |first=Larry |last=Weitzman |publisher=Theautochannel.com|year=2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>  While its GVWR exempted it from emissions standards applied to light-duty vehicles, Ford designed the powertrains of the Excursion to meet [[United States vehicle emission standards#Phase 1: 1994\u20131999|low-emissions vehicle]] (LEV) status.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.klik.com.my/item/story/479106/ford-excursion-makes-a-grand-debut|title=Ford Excursion makes a grand debut {{!}} KLiK|website=www.klik.com.my|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>    \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Engine\n!Configuration\n!Fuel\n!Production\n!Horsepower output\n!Torque output\n!Transmission\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#5.4|Triton]] V8''\n|{{Convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V8\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gasoline\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2000\u20132005\n|{{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|350|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" |4-speed automatic\nFord [[Ford C6 transmission#4R100|4R100]]\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#6.8|Triton]] V10''\n|{{Convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V10\n|{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#7.3|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|444|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV V8 turbo\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Diesel\n|2000\u20132003.5\n|{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#6.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV 4V V8 turbo\n|2003.5-2005\n|{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed automatic\n\nFord 5R110W TorqShift<ref>2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 Ford Truck/SUV source books</ref>\n|}\n\n===Body design===\nWhile the Ford Expedition shared design influences from the popular Ford Explorer, the Excursion adopted a high degree of commonality from its F-250 Super Duty counterpart.  With the exception of its eggcrate grille (styled similar to the Ford Expedition and the third-generation Explorer), the front bodywork and two front doors are shared entirely with the Super Duty pickups, the rear doors are very similar to the Super Duty Crew Cab doors, but have more of a curve on the back side edge, thus being specific to the Excursion.  Styled similar to the Bronco (with flush-mounted glass), the Excursion is fitted with a third-row seat and rear cargo area behind the second-row door; dependent on configuration, the vehicle could accommodate to nine passengers.  In place of a conventional liftgate, the cargo door was configured as a 3-way design, pairing an upper liftgate with two lower dutch doors (similar to the 1992-2005 [[Chevrolet Astro]]); the taillamps were sourced from the E-Series van. \n\nDuring its production, the Excursion saw few major changes to its interior or exterior.  For 2002, the instrument panel was updated, receiving a digital odometer.  For 2005, the eggcrate grille was replaced by the three-bar grille used on Super Duty trucks.\n\nCoinciding with its design commonality with the Ford Super Duty crew cab, the Excursion is one of the only mass-produced SUVs ever produced with four full-length passenger doors (along with the Expedition MAX and Lincoln Navigator L, the Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC and Cadillac counterparts, and the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Excursion, 12.

The base trim was XL (marketed nearly exclusively for fleet sales), XLT (standard trim in retail markets), and Limited (highest trim line). Following its use across many Ford light trucks, an Eddie Bauer trim package was introduced for the Excursion for 2003 (differing from the Limited primarily in appearance). \n\n'''XLT''': Included three rows of seating, leather-wrapped steering wheel with speed control, a security system, keyless entry, {{convert|16|inch|abbr=on|cm}} chrome steel rims or optional alloy rims, trailer towing, and an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD player with six premium speakers, and air conditioning.\n\n'''Limited''': Included same features as XLT, but adds a power driver's seat, rear audio controls, illuminated running boards, {{convert|16|in|abbr=on|cm}} alloy rims, front-speed sensitive windshield wipers, five power points, ten cupholders, heated front seats, leather seats, and an optional rear entertainment system with DVD player.\n\n==Reception==\nFor its 2000 model year launch, the Ford Excursion was described by [[Popular Science]] as the \"biggest sport utility on the planet.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet |title=Big, bigger, biggest |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1999 |volume=255 |issue=5 |page=48 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}</ref>  2000 would be the most successful model year for the Excursion, with nearly 69,000 examples sold.  After largely meeting sales projections at its launch<ref name=\":1\" />, demand for the model line was affected by the [[2000s energy crisis|energy crisis of the 2000s]].  While able to produce 70,000 examples yearly<ref name=\":1\" />, sales from 2001 onward struggled to reach half of that capacity, becoming the lowest-selling SUV sold by Ford or Lincoln-Mercury.      \n\nThe large size of the Excursion led to it being dubbed the ''Ford Valdez'' by [[Sierra Club|The Sierra Club]] in 1999 (in reference to the [[Exxon Valdez]] supertanker).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0399/et0399s4.html|title=ET 3/99: Ford's new gas-guzzling SUV wins the \"Exxon Valdez\" award from the Sierra Club|website=www.sdearthtimes.com|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>  In 2007, [[TIME Magazine]] selected it as one of the ''Fifty Worst Cars of All Time''.<ref name=\"time\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658538,00.html|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time - TIME|date=2007-09-07|work=Time|access-date=2020-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===F-250 Tropivan===\nFrom 1998 to 2012, a second-party SUV conversion of the Ford F-250 was sold in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o NA \u2013 F-250 Tropivan |url= https://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/avaliacao-na-f-250-tropivan/ |website=Not\u00edcias Automotivas |language=pt-BR |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> Similar in design and layout to the Excursion, the F-250 Tropivan differed primarily in its being a second-party conversion (similar to the Centurion Classic). In contrast to the Excursion, two different wheelbases of the model were produced.\n\nAs with all Super Duty trucks in Brazil, the Tropivan had a different engine selection throughout its production run that included a 4.2&nbsp;L Essex gasoline V6 and two diesels: a 3.9&nbsp;L Cummins B-series and the 4.2&nbsp;L straight-6 MWM Sprint 6.07TCA.\n\n===Aftermarket===\nDuring and since its production, the Excursion has become a basis for several types of aftermarket vehicles.  As a result of its body commonality with the Super Duty model range, the bodywork of the Excursion led to aftermarket conversions of Ford medium-duty truck chassis (Ford F-650 and F-750) to SUVs; to accommodate the longer wheelbase, the body typically is fitted with an extra set of doors.  At the other end of the size scale, the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#VelociRaptor SUV|Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV]] was created by mating the rear bodywork of the Excursion with the bodywork of the first-generation [[Ford Raptor]] (a practice similar to the creation of the 1990s Centurion Classic C350).  Other conversions involve fitting 2000-2005 Excursions with the front fascias of 2006-2016 Super Duty pickup trucks (as the Excursion shares its chassis with the F-250).   \n\nThe Excursion also served as a basis for stretch limousines; coinciding with its heavier-duty chassis, many examples were stretched (unofficially) longer than the 120-inch limit imposed by Ford on the Lincoln Town Car sedan.      \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Expedition SUV Limo (2783513262).jpg|Ford Excursion stretch limousine\nFile:ROCMP Ford Excursion limited Armored Car Display at CKS Memorial Hall Square 20140607a.jpg|Ford Excursion armored car in use by [[Republic of China Military Police]] (Taiwan)\nFile:Ford F650 4X4 Truck - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|6-door Ford F-650 Super Duty SUV in Australia (Ford Excursion bodywork)\n</gallery>\n\n==Yearly U.S. sales==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Following the discontinuation of the Excursion, Ford introduced the extended-length [[Ford Expedition#Expedition EL/Max|Ford Expedition EL/MAX]]; while matching the Chevrolet Suburban in terms of size, the Expedition EL/MAX shifted its chassis commonality from the Super Duty to the F-150.  As of current production, Ford has not produced another SUV derived from the Super Duty model line.  \n\nThroughout its production, the Ford Excursion was assembled at the [[Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] alongside Super Duty pickup trucks; the final example was produced on September 30, 2005.\n\n==Origin==\nFor 1978, Ford introduced the second-generation [[Ford Bronco#Second generation (1978\u20131979)|Ford Bronco]].  To compete directly against the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy]] and [[Dodge Ramcharger]], the Bronco became a full-size SUV, adopting the chassis and powertrain of the F-100 pickup truck (lowering its production costs); continuing the most popular design of its predecessor, the second-generation Bronco was produced strictly as a three-door wagon (with a lift-off hardtop).      \n\nAfter the 1975 discontinuation of the [[International Harvester Travelall]], the Suburban became the sole full-size SUV produced in a four-door bodystyle (far larger than the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]]).  During the 1980s and early 1990s, four-door Broncos were developed; in place of production vehicles, a limited number of license-built conversions (mating a Bronco body with F-Series crew cabs) were sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-ford-classic-350-centurion-vehicles-creates-a-frankenstein-suburban-fighter/|title=Curbside Classic: Ford Classic 350 \u2013 Centurion Vehicles Creates A Frankenstein Suburban Fighter|last=Snitkoff|first=Edward|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228070650/http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|title=This is the 4-Door Ford Bronco You Didn\u2019t Know Existed|date=2016-02-28|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>  Ford produced its first four-door SUV for 1991, as the [[Ford Explorer#First generation (1991\u20131994)|Ford Explorer]] replaced the [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]; both model lines were derived from the compact [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ranger]] pickup truck.     \n\nFor 1997, the Ford Bronco was replaced by the [[Ford Expedition]]; coinciding with changing segment demands, the Expedition was offered solely as a five-door wagon.  While changing its body configuration, the Expedition retained model commonality with the F-Series with its Bronco predecessor.  Sized between the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and Suburban, the Expedition was fitted with three-row seating (offered by the Suburban).        \n\nFor 1999, Ford expanded the F-Series model range, with the F-250 and F-350 becoming the Super Duty series.  Intended for work usage and towing, Super Duty F-Series trucks received a heavier-duty chassis and suspension along with a distinct body design.  To compete against the 2500-series Suburban, Ford began development of a heavy-duty SUV derived from the F-250 Super Duty pickup truck.     \n\n==Design overview==\n\n===Chassis===\nThe Ford Excursion was produced sharing the platform architecture of the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck. Sharing quite a bit of its chassis components and dimensions with the F-250 Super Cab, 8' Bed. The Excursion shares a common width, wheelbase, and front/rear track width with its F-250 counterpart. Other shared assemblies include the front and most of the rear suspension (the leaf springs and front spring hanger bracket were specific to the Excursion), along with the steering gear. From where the front sway bar mounts to the frame, back,is specific to the Excursion. And from this point back the frame is a little taller and much wider than its F-250 cousin.  The rear axle for all Excursions was a [[Sterling 10.5 axle]]. The [[four wheel drive]] models were equipped with a NV273 [[transfer case]] and [[Dana 50]] front axle. Gear ratios of 3:73 and 4:30 were offered.\n\nDuring the development of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]]) to become severely overridden in a head-on collision. In the test, the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus (reducing the chance of survival for its driver).<ref name=\"bradsher\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad|url-access=registration|title=High and mighty: the dangerous rise of the SUV|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58648-203-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad/page/199 199]|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper \"blocker beam\"; the device was initially tested by the French transportation ministry in 1971.<ref name=\"bradsher\" /> For the rear of the chassis, Ford chose to include a trailer hitch as standard equipment in production to reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.\n\n==== Powertrain ====\nDuring its entire production, the Excursion was offered with both gasoline and diesel engines.  The standard engine was a 5.4L Triton V8 with a 6.8L V10 offered as an option.  At its launch, the optional diesel engine was the Navistar-produced 7.3L Powerstroke V8; a 6.0L V8 was introduced during 2003, retaining the Powerstroke name.\n\nAll four engines were paired with an automatic transmission.  The 4-speed 4R100 automatic was fitted to the 5.4., 6.8, and 7.3L engines, with a 5-speed 5R110W automatic fitted to the 6.0L engine.  \n\nThough using the <big>\u00be</big>-ton chassis of the F-250, the Excursion was rated with a [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] of {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} when equipped with gasoline engines and {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} with equipped with diesel engines.  As its GVWR was above {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on|}}, the Excursion was exempt from EPA fuel economy ratings; reviewers cited fuel economy in the range of 12-15mpg with the V10 gasoline engine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2000/lweitzman_ford_excursion_2000.html |title=The Ford Excursion, It doesn't get any Bigger |first=Larry |last=Weitzman |publisher=Theautochannel.com|year=2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>  While its GVWR exempted it from emissions standards applied to light-duty vehicles, Ford designed the powertrains of the Excursion to meet [[United States vehicle emission standards#Phase 1: 1994\u20131999|low-emissions vehicle]] (LEV) status.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.klik.com.my/item/story/479106/ford-excursion-makes-a-grand-debut|title=Ford Excursion makes a grand debut {{!}} KLiK|website=www.klik.com.my|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>    \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Engine\n!Configuration\n!Fuel\n!Production\n!Horsepower output\n!Torque output\n!Transmission\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#5.4|Triton]] V8''\n|{{Convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V8\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gasoline\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2000\u20132005\n|{{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|350|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" |4-speed automatic\nFord [[Ford C6 transmission#4R100|4R100]]\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#6.8|Triton]] V10''\n|{{Convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V10\n|{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#7.3|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|444|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV V8 turbo\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Diesel\n|2000\u20132003.5\n|{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#6.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV 4V V8 turbo\n|2003.5-2005\n|{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed automatic\n\nFord 5R110W TorqShift<ref>2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 Ford Truck/SUV source books</ref>\n|}\n\n===Body design===\nWhile the Ford Expedition shared design influences from the popular Ford Explorer, the Excursion adopted a high degree of commonality from its F-250 Super Duty counterpart.  With the exception of its eggcrate grille (styled similar to the Ford Expedition and the third-generation Explorer), the front bodywork and two front doors are shared entirely with the Super Duty pickups, the rear doors are very similar to the Super Duty Crew Cab doors, but have more of a curve on the back side edge, thus being specific to the Excursion.  Styled similar to the Bronco (with flush-mounted glass), the Excursion is fitted with a third-row seat and rear cargo area behind the second-row door; dependent on configuration, the vehicle could accommodate to nine passengers.  In place of a conventional liftgate, the cargo door was configured as a 3-way design, pairing an upper liftgate with two lower dutch doors (similar to the 1992-2005 [[Chevrolet Astro]]); the taillamps were sourced from the E-Series van. \n\nDuring its production, the Excursion saw few major changes to its interior or exterior.  For 2002, the instrument panel was updated, receiving a digital odometer.  For 2005, the eggcrate grille was replaced by the three-bar grille used on Super Duty trucks.\n\nCoinciding with its design commonality with the Ford Super Duty crew cab, the Excursion is among one of the only mass-produced SUVs ever produced with four full-length passenger doors (along with the Expedition MAX and Lincoln Navigator L, the Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC and Cadillac counterparts, and the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Excursion, 12.

The base trim was XL (marketed nearly exclusively for fleet sales), XLT (standard trim in retail markets), and Limited (highest trim line). Following its use across many Ford light trucks, an Eddie Bauer trim package was introduced for the Excursion for 2003 (differing from the Limited primarily in appearance). \n\n'''XLT''': Included three rows of seating, leather-wrapped steering wheel with speed control, a security system, keyless entry, {{convert|16|inch|abbr=on|cm}} chrome steel rims or optional alloy rims, trailer towing, and an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD player with six premium speakers, and air conditioning.\n\n'''Limited''': Included same features as XLT, but adds a power driver's seat, rear audio controls, illuminated running boards, {{convert|16|in|abbr=on|cm}} alloy rims, front-speed sensitive windshield wipers, five power points, ten cupholders, heated front seats, leather seats, and an optional rear entertainment system with DVD player.\n\n==Reception==\nFor its 2000 model year launch, the Ford Excursion was described by [[Popular Science]] as the \"biggest sport utility on the planet.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet |title=Big, bigger, biggest |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1999 |volume=255 |issue=5 |page=48 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}</ref>  2000 would be the most successful model year for the Excursion, with nearly 69,000 examples sold.  After largely meeting sales projections at its launch<ref name=\":1\" />, demand for the model line was affected by the [[2000s energy crisis|energy crisis of the 2000s]].  While able to produce 70,000 examples yearly<ref name=\":1\" />, sales from 2001 onward struggled to reach half of that capacity, becoming the lowest-selling SUV sold by Ford or Lincoln-Mercury.      \n\nThe large size of the Excursion led to it being dubbed the ''Ford Valdez'' by [[Sierra Club|The Sierra Club]] in 1999 (in reference to the [[Exxon Valdez]] supertanker).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0399/et0399s4.html|title=ET 3/99: Ford's new gas-guzzling SUV wins the \"Exxon Valdez\" award from the Sierra Club|website=www.sdearthtimes.com|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>  In 2007, [[TIME Magazine]] selected it as one of the ''Fifty Worst Cars of All Time''.<ref name=\"time\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658538,00.html|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time - TIME|date=2007-09-07|work=Time|access-date=2020-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===F-250 Tropivan===\nFrom 1998 to 2012, a second-party SUV conversion of the Ford F-250 was sold in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o NA \u2013 F-250 Tropivan |url= https://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/avaliacao-na-f-250-tropivan/ |website=Not\u00edcias Automotivas |language=pt-BR |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> Similar in design and layout to the Excursion, the F-250 Tropivan differed primarily in its being a second-party conversion (similar to the Centurion Classic). In contrast to the Excursion, two different wheelbases of the model were produced.\n\nAs with all Super Duty trucks in Brazil, the Tropivan had a different engine selection throughout its production run that included a 4.2&nbsp;L Essex gasoline V6 and two diesels: a 3.9&nbsp;L Cummins B-series and the 4.2&nbsp;L straight-6 MWM Sprint 6.07TCA.\n\n===Aftermarket===\nDuring and since its production, the Excursion has become a basis for several types of aftermarket vehicles.  As a result of its body commonality with the Super Duty model range, the bodywork of the Excursion led to aftermarket conversions of Ford medium-duty truck chassis (Ford F-650 and F-750) to SUVs; to accommodate the longer wheelbase, the body typically is fitted with an extra set of doors.  At the other end of the size scale, the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#VelociRaptor SUV|Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV]] was created by mating the rear bodywork of the Excursion with the bodywork of the first-generation [[Ford Raptor]] (a practice similar to the creation of the 1990s Centurion Classic C350).  Other conversions involve fitting 2000-2005 Excursions with the front fascias of 2006-2016 Super Duty pickup trucks (as the Excursion shares its chassis with the F-250).   \n\nThe Excursion also served as a basis for stretch limousines; coinciding with its heavier-duty chassis, many examples were stretched (unofficially) longer than the 120-inch limit imposed by Ford on the Lincoln Town Car sedan.      \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Expedition SUV Limo (2783513262).jpg|Ford Excursion stretch limousine\nFile:ROCMP Ford Excursion limited Armored Car Display at CKS Memorial Hall Square 20140607a.jpg|Ford Excursion armored car in use by [[Republic of China Military Police]] (Taiwan)\nFile:Ford F650 4X4 Truck - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|6-door Ford F-650 Super Duty SUV in Australia (Ford Excursion bodywork)\n</gallery>\n\n==Yearly U.S. sales==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at [[West Kildonan Collegiate]]. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either \"flunked or dropped out and came back\", and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had \"discipline and determination\" because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his \"lack of studiousness\", and finished his schooling at [[Garden City Collegiate]]. He went on to study business administration at what is now [[Red River College]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mbteach.org/extras/teacher%20appreciation/randy%20bachman.html|title=randy bachman|publisher=The Manitoba Teachers' Society|date=January 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Profession musical career==\n===The Guess Who===\nIn 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to record and tour until the end of the decade, after Randy agreed to sell the rights to the \"BTO\" name to the remaining band members.\n\n===1979-1980===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other pars of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After Bachman-Turner Overdrive broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988 they reformed and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]]. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called \"Every Song Tells A Story\", where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] performed throughout Canada as [[Bachman & Cummings (band)|Bachman & Cummings]] in the summer of 2006, while on tour with [[The Carpet Frogs]]. Bachman and Fred Turner completed a new [[Bachman & Turner]] album that was released in September 2010. The album's single titled \"Rollin' Along\", was released in June 2010 on iTunes. The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010\u201311) under their Bachman & Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The pair released the next single, \"Rock n' Roll Is the Only Way Out\" on their official website.<ref name=GibsonPart2/><ref>Wawzenek, Bryan.

The album was influenced by classic 1960s [[blues rock]] and features musical contributions from other musicians including: [[Neil Young]], [[Joe Bonamassa]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band|Robert Randolph]], and [[Jeff Healey]]. Later in March 2018, Randy Bachman released a tribute to George Harrison containing cover version of the latter's hits.

He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at [[West Kildonan Collegiate]]. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either \"flunked or dropped out and came back\", and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had \"discipline and determination\" because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his \"lack of studiousness\", and finished his schooling at [[Garden City Collegiate]]. He went on to study business administration at what is now [[Red River College]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mbteach.org/extras/teacher%20appreciation/randy%20bachman.html|title=randy bachman|publisher=The Manitoba Teachers' Society|date=January 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Profession musical career==\n===The Guess Who===\nIn 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to tour, after Randy agreed to rights the band held to the name.\n\n===1979-1980===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other pars of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After Bachman-Turner Overdrive broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988 they reformed and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]].

Many families are related with it. Sultan Hasan Ali Khan of Boi also belong to the same tribe. This family tree was published in the year of 1920 By Khuda Bakhsh Khan Banbah, not at the time of partition of India and Pakistan.\n\nMost people knows that Abdullah Al Asghar was died in early age but this is not correct. Some authentic historians are agreed that he was not died at the age of six. Al Masudi, <ref> Tareekh e Masudi </ref> tells that he was died at the age of 67.\n\nTahir Almaki<ref> Haqiqi Ahle Bait yani Rasoolalah Ki Ghar Walian </ref> gives the reference of Al Masoodi on his own research in his book.

The major and chief branch of Jabrati is from the descendants of Usman ibn Affan's son Abdullah whose mother was Ruqayya, the daughter of [[Muhammad]].\n\nHashmatullah Lakhnavi,<ref>Tareekh e Jamu</ref> Molana Nadvi,<ref>Arab O Hind Kay Tauluqat</ref> Mohammadudin Fouq,<ref>Tareekh e Aqwam e Kashmir</ref> Sher Bahadur Khan Panni <ref>Tareekh e Hazara</ref> are also agreed that Abdullah Al Asghar did not died at the early age and Banbahs are not the local residents of Kashmir.\n\nIn the book ''Sultan Bahoo'' the author Sultan Muhammad Najib ur Rehman gives a family tree of  \"Bibi Pak Daman (Bibi Rasti)\"  the mother of Shah Rukn e Alam (Multan). He gives the family tree as a proof that Bibi Rasti (Bibi Pak Daman) was not the mother of Sultan Bahoo. She was the daughter of Sultan Jamal ud Din Muhammad Al-Farghani. The family tree is given in the pictures below named by Shajra Bani Ruqayya 3-4.\n\nThe family tree which is available at Muzaffarabad International Library and Gujarkhan municipal corporation office, According to this family tree which is dated on 1905 A.D. The family is migrated from Badakshan to Kashmir. Molana Akbar Shah Khan Najeeb Abadi Says in his book Tareek-e-Islam That, when Abbasi's got the power and they became in rule they ordered to kill all of Bani Umayya's. But some of them succeed to escape and spread in Koh-e-Sulaiman, Sind, Punjab and Kashmir and did not showed their family name and identity, in fact, they changed their identity to save themselves. \n\nIn \"Tareekh Aqwame Kashmir\" Muhammad ud Deen Fouq says that in the history \"Sultan Muzaffar Khan\" the founder of \"Muzaffarabad\" Azad Kashmir was the first man who is known by the name \"Banbah\".\n\nAccording to the family tree, Sultan Kashif arrived in Kashmir from Badakshan. History tells us that at the time of Mehdi Abbasi, one of the grandsons of Ameer M\u00e1aviyah who was escaped to Khurasan, came to the palace and met Mehdi Abbasi and ask him to kill the muqanea, the fake prophet in Khurasan.\n \nAccording to \"Tareekh e Hazara\" by Sher Bahadur Khan Panni, Sultan Kashif arrived in Kashmir from Badakshan at the time of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, and settled in Kurmung, Kamal Khan was the governor of the Kurmung from the Turk's rule, He married his daughter to Kashif Khan. But after a few years he killed him. Kashif Khan had a son from Kamal Khan's daughter, named Qasim Khan. Sultan Muzaffar Khan was descendant of Qasim Khan in the 16th generation.\nThe last picture in the bottom is a small portion of \"Tareekh e Hazara\". in this portion the author discussed \"Banbah Tribe\" in details.\n\nThis is another evidence to proof that the Banbah tribe is not from the hill Rajpoot origin.

This was the first feature film role for star [[James Naughton]], who portrays a [[stock broker]] whose new jogging hobby turns into an obsession to excel at [[long distance running]], straining his career and his relationship with his wife ([[Lindsay Wagner]]).\n\nThe film is Shebib's fourth feature. Commercially unsuccessful, reviews of ''Second Wind'' were mixed, tending to praise the cinematography and acting, but usually faulting the script. ''Second Wind'' won a [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] award and two [[Canadian Screen Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Mathieson ([[James Naughton]]) is a 30-year-old stockbroker for whom everything has come easily. One day, he sees a TV report about a 26-year's old running champion and listens intently to remarks from that athlete's coach. Inspired, Mathieson begins jogging, soon discovering he's not in great shape\u2014yet Mathieson persists, fascinated by the notion of trying something difficult for the first time in his life. He trains obsessively to be a winner. This creates friction with his wife, Linda ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who does not understand why her husband prefers spending time alone to spending time with her. His new hobby also creates problems at work, distracted when he should be focused on a major deal, allowing an ambitious coworker to usurp his stature as the firm's golden boy. As if that were not enough, an attractive woman named Paula ([[Tedde Moore]]) hits on him one day while he is out jogging, then tries to seduce him, testing his fidelity to his long-suffering wife. It's almost too late for his marriage by the time he learns that he's been risking \"the right things in the wrong place.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[James Naughton]] as Roger Mathieson\n*[[Lindsay Wagner]] as Linda Mathieson\n* [[Ken Pogue|Kenneth Pogue]] as Pete\n* [[Tedde Moore]] as Paula\n* Tom Harvey as Frank\n* [[Louis Del Grande]] as Howie\n* [[Gerard Parkes]] as Packard\n* [[Jonathan Welsh]] as Simon\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Graham\n* Allan Levson as Kevin\n* Vivian Reis as Winnie\n* Robert Goodier as broker\n* Mike Hurley as runner\n* Robyn Jaffe as Rodger's secretary\n* Robert Slee as broker\n* John D.

It started out as a problem created by [[Kodak]] coming out with a new stock (\"they never ask us, the people who use it\"), which made it impossible to make use of [[photographic processing|force processing]]. For Morris to not lose the \"extra stop\" ([[f-stop]]) gained by force processing, he had to look for other means, \"and that other means is a fast lens.\" With it, Morris said that the less light is used, \"you find that you don't really have to fill anything because it fills itself.\"<blockquote>There was a scene in a kitchen in ''Second  Wind'' that I shot virtually with existing light. The sun was shining through the kitchen window and it was hitting the floor and  bouncing up and filling the whole room. I had seen it and hadn't done much about it because I thought maybe the director doesn't go for that sort of thing, but much to my surprise Don Shebib said \"Wow, look at that!\" So I did shoot it without any other light. I couldn't  have done it without high speed lenses.<ref name=\"Irwin\" /></blockquote>Ordinarily, explained Morris, there is a certain difficulty with repeated takes under the shifting effects of the sun, the angles of sunlight and strength making match shots tricky.<ref name=\"Edwards\">{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=Natalie (interviewer) |title=On hand too. |journal=[[Cinema Canada]] |date=February 1976 |pages=29\u201331 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/485/557 |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[Hagood Hardy]]'s theme for ''Second Wind'' appears on his LP ''Maybe Tomorrow'' ([[Attic Records]], 1976).<ref>{{cite web |title=Hagood Hardy \u2013 Maybe Tomorrow |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hagood-Hardy-Maybe-Tomorrow/master/413417 |website=discogs.com |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Second Wind'' had its premiere at Plaza 2 in Toronto on 9 April 1976.<ref name=Item /> Its American premiere took place at the [[University of Iowa]] student-run Refocus film, video and photography festival on 17 April 1976, with Shebib in attendance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Redford, 'President's Men' open REFOCUS festival |url=http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/1976/di1976-04-15.pdf |accessdate=29 April 2019 |work=[[Daily Iowan]] |date=15 April 1976}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nAmerican film producer and sales agent [[Arnold Kopelson]] was tasked with selling ''Second Wind'' internationally during its screening at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].<ref name=\"Tadros\">{{cite journal |last1=Tadros |first1=Connie |title=Cannes (1): commercial results. |journal=[[Cinema Canada]] |date=June-July 1976 |issue=29 |pages=21-23 |url=https://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/download |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref> Executive producer Les Weinstein worried that \"the film had become just one of many for the sales agent and was not being adequately pushed.\"<ref name=\"Tadros\" /> \n\n===Home media===\nA VHS cassette was released in 1993 by [[VidAmerica]], Inc.

Walsh hails the direction, the script, the cinematography and especially the cast, who are \"little-known but solidly professional performers who put it across to near perfection\", reserving particular praise for Naughton. \"Shebib provides him with top direction and solid support in all departments. Cameraman Reginald Morris\u2019s cinematography is slick and sophisticated. Hagood Hardy\u2019s inspired musical score knows just when to shut up and when to come on strong.\" And writer Hal Ackerman \"skillfully steers a course between plot excesses and banality\".<ref name=\"Walsh\" /> Six years later, Walsh reaffirmed that ''Second Wind'' was \"a finely-wrought film\" and considered it \"the precursor\" of films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=Secret too good to keep |url=http://reelingback.com/articles/secret_too_good_to_keep |website=Reeling Back |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nClive Denton, while less effusive, nevertheless also praised the film for its music, cinematography and direction, calling the script \"well-structured\", and \"often sharp and witty\", though he felt there was some \"sketchiness\" to the family relationship, saying the script is \"below its best level\" with the wife and the son seems like a \"perky little visitor\" rather than their own child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Clive |title=Don Shebib's Second Wind |journal=Cinema Canada |date=April 1976 |pages= 53\u201354 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/547/619 |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> [[Marni Jackson]] thought the story was \"a good idea\" and called the film \"dutifully pretty,\" but called the characters \"so diaphanous you can see daylight through them,\" concluding the project suffered from a low budget, \"which says more about the Canadian film-making climate than Shebib.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Maurice \u00c9lia echoed many of Jackson's impressions: the story itself is quite original and a source of inspiration in some sense, and, for the first time (on the screen or off), Toronto actually looks good (perhaps to the point of exaggeration).<ref name=\"Elia\" /> The film begins well, but loses its way due to an ineptly written script littered with the kind of dialogue which undermines the credibility of the supporting characters: Paula is a sketch at best and the couple's son barely exists at all; even Lindsay Wagner's character is effectively a secondary character made up of unacceptable rejoinders.<ref name=\"Elia\" />\n\nJohn Reeves said that ''Second Wind'' is well filmed and acted, but likewise faulted the script as unbelievable: the film does not accurately show the realities of training for competition, and thereby relegates itself to the realm of [[melodrama]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reeves |first1=John |title=The soup opera route |journal=Cinema Canada |date=May 1976 |issue= 28 |pages= 22\u201323}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \"innocuous saga,\" and faulting it for not explaining why the protagonist \"refuses to explain the character of his obsession to his wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Wind |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/second-wind/review/117081/ |website=TV Guide |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Retrospective====\nPeter Hanson describes ''Second Wind'' as \"amiably predictable\", a kind of cinematic \"comfort food\", made when \"small movies about the everyday lives of ordinary people were made regularly, even if those pictures sometimes emerged from the fringes of the industry\".<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Peter |title=Second Wind (1976) |url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2018/02/second-wind-1976.html |website=Every 70's Movie |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>  The characters are \"drawn fairly well\" (Hanson notes that Hal Ackerman went on to become a popular screenwriting teacher at [[UCLA]]'s film school), \"and some of the dialogue clicks, especially passages of sarcastic banter.\"<blockquote>More importantly, the overall narrative has a pleasing shape, fully exploring Roger's dalliance with athletic endeavor. Therefore, fretting that the picture lacks surprise somewhat misses the point, since the focus is Roger testing his limits. Naughton, never the deepest of players, lends likeability and sincerity, while Wagner mostly runs her fingers through her hair.

This was the first feature film role for star [[James Naughton]], who portrays a [[stock broker]] whose new jogging hobby turns into an obsession to excel at [[long distance running]], straining his career and his relationship with his wife ([[Lindsay Wagner]]).\n\nThe film is Shebib's fourth feature. Commercially unsuccessful, reviews of ''Second Wind'' were mixed, tending to praise the cinematography and acting, but usually faulting the script. ''Second Wind'' won a [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] award and two [[Canadian Screen Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Mathieson ([[James Naughton]]) is a 30-year-old stockbroker for whom everything has come easily. One day, he sees a TV report about a 26-year's old running champion and listens intently to remarks from that athlete's coach. Inspired, Mathieson begins jogging, soon discovering he's not in great shape\u2014yet Mathieson persists, fascinated by the notion of trying something difficult for the first time in his life. He trains obsessively to be a winner. This creates friction with his wife, Linda ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who does not understand why her husband prefers spending time alone to spending time with her. His new hobby also creates problems at work, distracted when he should be focused on a major deal, allowing an ambitious coworker to usurp his stature as the firm's golden boy. As if that were not enough, an attractive woman named Paula ([[Tedde Moore]]) hits on him one day while he is out jogging, then tries to seduce him, testing his fidelity to his long-suffering wife. It's almost too late for his marriage by the time he learns that he's been risking \"the right things in the wrong place.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[James Naughton]] as Roger Mathieson\n*[[Lindsay Wagner]] as Linda Mathieson\n* [[Ken Pogue|Kenneth Pogue]] as Pete\n* [[Tedde Moore]] as Paula\n* Tom Harvey as Frank\n* [[Louis Del Grande]] as Howie\n* [[Gerard Parkes]] as Packard\n* [[Jonathan Welsh]] as Simon\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Graham\n* Allan Levson as Kevin\n* Vivian Reis as Winnie\n* Robert Goodier as broker\n* Mike Hurley as runner\n* Robyn Jaffe as Rodger's secretary\n* Robert Slee as broker\n* John D.

It started out as a problem created by [[Kodak]] coming out with a new stock (\"they never ask us, the people who use it\"), which made it impossible to make use of [[photographic processing|force processing]]. For Morris to not lose the \"extra stop\" ([[f-stop]]) gained by force processing, he had to look for other means, \"and that other means is a fast lens.\" With it, Morris said that the less light is used, \"you find that you don't really have to fill anything because it fills itself.\"<blockquote>There was a scene in a kitchen in ''Second  Wind'' that I shot virtually with existing light. The sun was shining through the kitchen window and it was hitting the floor and  bouncing up and filling the whole room. I had seen it and hadn't done much about it because I thought maybe the director doesn't go for that sort of thing, but much to my surprise Don Shebib said \"Wow, look at that!\" So I did shoot it without any other light. I couldn't  have done it without high speed lenses.<ref name=\"Irwin\" /></blockquote>Ordinarily, explained Morris, there is a certain difficulty with repeated takes under the shifting effects of the sun, the angles of sunlight and strength making match shots tricky.<ref name=\"Edwards\">{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=Natalie (interviewer) |title=On hand too. |journal=[[Cinema Canada]] |date=February 1976 |pages=29\u201331 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/485/557 |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[Hagood Hardy]]'s theme for ''Second Wind'' appears on his LP ''Maybe Tomorrow'' ([[Attic Records]], 1976).<ref>{{cite web |title=Hagood Hardy \u2013 Maybe Tomorrow |url=https://www.discogs.com/Hagood-Hardy-Maybe-Tomorrow/master/413417 |website=discogs.com |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Second Wind'' had its premiere at Plaza 2 in Toronto on 9 April 1976.<ref name=Item /> Its American premiere took place at the [[University of Iowa]] student-run Refocus film, video and photography festival on 17 April 1976, with Shebib in attendance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Redford, 'President's Men' open REFOCUS festival |url=http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/1976/di1976-04-15.pdf |accessdate=29 April 2019 |work=[[Daily Iowan]] |date=15 April 1976}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nAmerican film producer and sales agent [[Arnold Kopelson]] was tasked with selling ''Second Wind'' internationally during its screening at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].<ref name=\"Tadros\">{{cite journal |last1=Tadros |first1=Connie |title=Cannes (1): commercial results. |journal=[[Cinema Canada]] |date=June-July 1976 |issue=29 |pages=21-23 |url=https://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/download |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref> Executive producer Les Weinstein worried that \"the film had become just one of many for the sales agent and was not being adequately pushed.\"<ref name=\"Tadros\" /> \n\n===Home media===\nA VHS cassette was released in 1993 by [[VidAmerica]], Inc.

Walsh hails the direction, the script, the cinematography and especially the cast, who are \"little-known but solidly professional performers who put it across to near perfection\", reserving particular praise for Naughton. \"Shebib provides him with top direction and solid support in all departments. Cameraman Reginald Morris\u2019s cinematography is slick and sophisticated. Hagood Hardy\u2019s inspired musical score knows just when to shut up and when to come on strong.\" And writer Hal Ackerman \"skillfully steers a course between plot excesses and banality\".<ref name=\"Walsh\" /> Six years later, Walsh reaffirmed that ''Second Wind'' was \"a finely-wrought film\" and considered it \"the precursor\" of films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=Secret too good to keep |url=http://reelingback.com/articles/secret_too_good_to_keep |website=Reeling Back |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nClive Denton, while less effusive, nevertheless also praised the film for its music, cinematography and direction, calling the script \"well-structured\", and \"often sharp and witty\", though he felt there was some \"sketchiness\" to the family relationship, saying the script is \"below its best level\" with the wife and the son seems like a \"perky little visitor\" rather than their own child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Clive |title=Don Shebib's Second Wind |journal=Cinema Canada |date=April 1976 |pages= 53\u201354 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/547/619 |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> [[Marni Jackson]] thought the story was \"a good idea\" and called the film \"dutifully pretty,\" but called the characters \"so diaphanous you can see daylight through them,\" concluding the project suffered from a low budget, \"which says more about the Canadian film-making climate than Shebib.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Maurice \u00c9lia echoed many of Jackson's impressions: the story itself is quite original and a source of inspiration in some sense, and, for the first time (on the screen or off), Toronto actually looks good (perhaps to the point of exaggeration).<ref name=\"Elia\" /> The film begins well, but loses its way due to an ineptly written script littered with the kind of dialogue which undermines the credibility of the supporting characters: Paula is a sketch at best and the couple's son barely exists at all; even Lindsay Wagner's character is effectively a secondary character made up of unacceptable rejoinders.<ref name=\"Elia\" />\n\nJohn Reeves said that ''Second Wind'' is well filmed and acted, but likewise faulted the script as unbelievable: the film does not accurately show the realities of training for competition, and thereby relegates itself to the realm of [[melodrama]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reeves |first1=John |title=The soup opera route |journal=Cinema Canada |date=May 1976 |issue= 28 |pages= 22\u201323}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \"innocuous saga,\" and faulting it for not explaining why the protagonist \"refuses to explain the character of his obsession to his wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Wind |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/second-wind/review/117081/ |website=TV Guide |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Retrospective====\nPeter Hanson describes ''Second Wind'' as \"amiably predictable\", a kind of cinematic \"comfort food\", made when \"small movies about the everyday lives of ordinary people were made regularly, even if those pictures sometimes emerged from the fringes of the industry\".<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Peter |title=Second Wind (1976) |url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2018/02/second-wind-1976.html |website=Every 70's Movie |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>  The characters are \"drawn fairly well\" (Hanson notes that Hal Ackerman went on to become a popular screenwriting teacher at [[UCLA]]'s film school), \"and some of the dialogue clicks, especially passages of sarcastic banter.\"<blockquote>More importantly, the overall narrative has a pleasing shape, fully exploring Roger's dalliance with athletic endeavor. Therefore, fretting that the picture lacks surprise somewhat misses the point, since the focus is Roger testing his limits. Naughton, never the deepest of players, lends likeability and sincerity, while Wagner mostly runs her fingers through her hair.
