{"title_page": "Ad serving", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n'''Ad serving''' describes the technology and service that places [[Advertising|advertisement]]s on [[Website|Web site]]s. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Web sites and advertisers to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money, and monitor progress of different [[advertising campaign]]s. Ad servers are divided into two types\u2014publisher ad servers and advertiser (or third party) ad servers.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn ad server is a Web server that stores advertising content used in online marketing and delivers that content onto various digital platforms such as Websites, social media outlets and mobile apps. An ad server is merely the technology in which the advertising material is stored and is the means of distributing that material into appropriate advertising slots online. Ad serving technology companies provide software to Websites and advertising companies to serve ads, count them, choose the ads that will make the Web site or advertiser the most money and monitor the progress of different online advertising campaigns. The purpose of ad serving is to deliver ads to users, to manage the advertising space of a Web site and, in the case of third party ad servers, to provide an independent counting and [[web tracking|tracking]] system for advertisers/marketers. Ad servers also act as a system in which advertisers can count clicks/impressions in order to generate reports, which helps to determine the return on investment for an advertisement on a particular Web page.\n\nThere are separate ad servers that publishers and third party (e.g. advertisers, marketers) use. Essentially, there is no difference in the technology that the ad servers provide, the key difference being the accessibility of data for optimized tracking and convenience. Advertisers and marketers use a centralized ad server that enables them to draw progress reports on demand and update their creative content in one place, rather than using individual publisher ad servers in which they will have to manage content across multiple servers with different publishers. Without this centralized hub which controls advertisers' rotation and distribution of content across the Web, there becomes issues around tracking and management of advertising material. If an advertiser had to make contact with each individual publisher whose ad server they are using, this would mean multiple sets of data to track and would also mean they need to update their creative content for each individual channel. This provides less-accurate, less-timely, and ultimately inconvenient results for advertisers. Publishers have separate ad servers to communicate advertising material across their domains only. This enables convenience for the publisher, as they will have access only to the advertising content they require for their publication rather than sort through an ad server containing all the advertising content in which Marketers/Advertisers are using.\n\n== History ==\nThe first central ad server was released by FocaLink Media Services and introduced on July 17, 1995,<ref>[http://www.zinman.com/images/FocalinkPressRelease.JPG Hyperlink Advertising Explodes on the World Wide Web], company press release</ref> for controlling the delivery of online advertising or banner ads.

The company was founded by Tom Shields and John Danner, and based in [[San Mateo, California]]. In 1998, the company went public on [[NASDAQ]] (NETG), and was purchased by [[DoubleClick]] in 1999. NetGravity AdServer was then renamed to DART Enterprise. In March 2008 Google acquired DoubleClick. Google has continued to improve and invest in DART Enterprise.

The ad server/ad management platform was renamed AdConductor and is still used by the company today.{{who|date=March 2018}}{{when|date=March 2018}}  The company was founded by Jarvis Coffin, David Stein and Bob Hanna, and based in [[Katonah, New York]].

All of these functions are an integral part of running an online advertising campaign in making sure that the advertising content is being displayed where and for whom it is intended. It also helps with analysis to see just how effective the campaign is and whether or not the content is generating the desired results.  Ad serving also offers more advanced functions for more sophisticated advertising campaigns. Advanced functions include frequency capping, [[Creative sequencing|sequencing ads]] (also referred to as surround sessions), [[search engine optimization]] and targeting (See Ad targeting and optimization, below). Frequency capping is limiting how many times a user will see the content. Advertisers are also able to limit ads by setting a cap on money-spending.\n\n== Ad targeting and optimization ==\nOne aspect of ad-serving technology is automated and semi-automated means of optimizing bid prices, placement, targeting, or other characteristics.  Significant methods include:\n* [[Behavioral targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 using a profile of prior behavior on the part of the viewer to determine which ad to show during a given visit. For example, targeting car ads on a portal to a viewer that was known to have visited the automotive section of a general media site.<ref name=\"Chen 2014 429\u2013449\">{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jianqing|author2=Jan Stallaert|title=An Economic Analysis of Online Advertising Using Behavioral Targeting|journal=MIS Quarterly|year=2014|volume=38|issue=2|pages=429\u2013449}}</ref> \n* [[Contextual advertising|Contextual targeting]]&nbsp;\u2014 (also known as Semantic Marketing) refers to the optimum ad placement as a result of analysing information from the entire Web page where the ad is being served. This concept was introduced as a way of improving the \u2018keyword approach' to ad placement where issues surrounding ambiguity in relation to a word's meaning in the prescribed context.  The concept of analysing the \u2018entire' Webpage in order to promote relevant advertising material is to benefit both the viewer of advertising content and the source of the ad. Keywords (or Adwords) are not always relevant in the context in which the word is intended. Therefore, by analysing the entire page rather than just the keyword, the ambiguity is removed and a more relevant and accurate ad is promoted into the advertising slot on the Web page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/divyank-turakhia-directi-tctv/|title=From Bootstrapping To $300M In Value: Meet The Founder Of Directi (TCTV)|last=Wauters|first=Robin|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n* Creative optimization&nbsp;\u2014 using experimental or predictive methods to explore the optimum creative for a given ad placement and exploiting that determination in further impressions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affiliate marketing]]\n*[[Ad exchange|Ad Exchange]]\n* [[Compensation methods]]\n* [[Contextual advertising]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Landing page]]\n* [[List of advertising networks]]\n* [[Pay-per-click]]\n* [[Pay per play]]\n* [[Website monetization]]\n* [[View-through rate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n'''Ad serving''' describes the technology and service that places [[Advertising|advertisement]]s on [[Website|Web site]]s.

Car\u00eame is often considered one of the first internationally renowned [[celebrity chef]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nAbandoned by his parents in Paris in 1794 at the height of the [[French Revolution]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=Brendan |year=2012 |title=Lives of Notorious Cooks |publisher=Chomu Press |isbn=978-1907681202 }}</ref> he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian [[chophouse]] in exchange for room and board. In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous ''[[Pastry chef|p\u00e2tissier]]'' with a shop near the [[Palais-Royal]]. The post-revolutionary Palais-Royal was a high profile, fashionable neighborhood filled with vibrant life and bustling crowds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Ian |title=Cooking for Kings, the Life of Antonin Car\u00e8me, the First Celebrity Chef |publisher=Walker & Company |year=2003 |pages=35\u201336 |isbn=978-0802714367 }}</ref> Bailly recognized his talent and ambition. By the time he was prepared to leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave his new employer when a better offer came along. Car\u00eame opened his own shop, the ''P\u00e2tisserie de la rue de la Paix'', which he maintained until 1813.\n\nCar\u00eame gained fame in Paris for his ''[[pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly had displayed in the p\u00e2tisserie window. He made these confections, which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modeled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural history books which he studied at the nearby [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly.<ref>Kelly (2004), Chapter 2.</ref> He is credited with the inventions of ''gros nougats''<ref>One of the pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es at the dinner served to the Prince Regent and the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, 18 January 1817 ([http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/princeregent3a.html Channel 4 reportage]) was \"Un gros nougat \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\"; the [[Royal Pavilion]] in sugar was also featured.</ref> and ''grosses meringues'', ''croquantes'', made of almonds and honey, and ''[[Sally Lunn bun#Origins|solilemmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Bernier |title=Antonin Car\u00eame (1783\u20131833): La sensualit\u00e9 en Europe |location=Paris |publisher=B.

While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses.\n\nNapoleon was famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of social relations in the world of diplomacy. In 1804, he gave money to [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] to purchase [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], a large estate outside Paris. The ch\u00e2teau was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took Car\u00eame with him.\n\nCar\u00eame was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole year\u2019s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. Car\u00eame passed the test and completed his training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoleon, Car\u00eame went to London for a time and served as ''chef de cuisine'' to the [[Prince Regent]], later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Returning to the continent, he accepted the invitation of Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to come to St. Petersburg, but stayed so briefly that he prepared not even a single meal for the Tsar. Upon returning to Paris, he became chef to banker [[James Mayer Rothschild]].<ref>[http://www.soupsong.com/rcareme.html Lady Morgan English fish soup (Creation of the great French Chef Marie Antoine Careme, 1784\u20131833)]</ref>\n\nCar\u00eame died in his Paris house on the Rue Neuve Saint Roche at the age of 48, due perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the coal burning stoves over which he cooked.<ref>Kelly, p. 79, 206</ref> He is remembered as the founder of the haute cuisine concept and is interred in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | title=CAREME Marie Antoine dit Antonin (1784-1833) | access-date=2015-02-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005314/http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | archive-date=2018-12-01 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nIn his first major position, Car\u00eame worked as ''chef de cuisine'' to Talleyrand, who encouraged Car\u00eame in the development of a new refined food style using herbs, fresh vegetables, and simplified sauces with few ingredients. Talleyrand became a famous host during the [[Congress of Vienna]]\u2014 by the time the congress disbanded, not only the map of Europe but also the culinary tastes of its upper classes had been thoroughly revised.\n\nCar\u00eame's impact on culinary matters ranged from trivial to theoretical. He is credited with creating the standard chef's hat, the ''[[Toque (French)#Culinary use|toque]]'', he devised new sauces and dishes, and he published a classification of all sauces into groups based on four [[mother sauces]].<ref name=\"Car\u00eame1854\">{{cite book|last=Car\u00eame|first=Marie Antonin|year=1854|title=L'art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle|volume=3|publisher=Au Depot de librairie|location=Paris|language=French|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0543991261|page=1|accessdate=7 December 2013}}</ref> He is also frequently credited with replacing the practice of ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' (serving all dishes at once) with ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' (serving each dish in the order printed on the menu) after he returned from service in the Russian court,<ref>\"...Service \u00e0 la russe [,] the style Car\u00eame helped to import from Russia...\": Kelly, p. 13</ref> but others say he was a diehard supporter of ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise''.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Car\u00eame made a final stand for the elaborate ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'', arguing for its superiority with his elaborate ''pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es'' |first=John |last=Fischer |title=Table Service |journal=Gastronomica |year=2001 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=90\u201391 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2001.1.3.90 }}</ref>\n\n==Works by Car\u00eame==\nCar\u00eame wrote several books on cookery,  above all the encyclopedic ''L'Art de la Cuisine Fran\u00e7aise'' (5 vols, 1833\u201334, of which he had completed three before his death), which included, aside from hundreds of recipes, plans for menus and opulent table settings, a history of French cookery, and instructions for organizing kitchens.\n\n* ''Le P\u00e2tissier royal parisien, ou Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et pratique de la p\u00e2tisserie moderne, suivi d'observations utiles au progr\u00e8s de cet art, et d'une revue critique des grands bals de 18\n* ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais, ou Parall\u00e8le de la cuisine ancienne et moderne, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sous rapport de l'ordonnance des menus selon les quatre saisons.''

Car\u00eame is often considered one of the first internationally renowned [[celebrity chef]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nAbandoned by his parents in Paris in 1794 at the height of the [[French Revolution]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Connell |first=Brendan |year=2012 |title=Lives of Notorious Cooks |publisher=Chomu Press |isbn=978-1907681202 }}</ref> he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian [[chophouse]] in exchange for room and board. In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous ''[[Pastry chef|p\u00e2tissier]]'' with a shop near the [[Palais-Royal]]. The post-revolutionary Palais-Royal was a high profile, fashionable neighborhood filled with vibrant life and bustling crowds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Ian |title=Cooking for Kings, the Life of Antonin Car\u00e8me, the First Celebrity Chef |publisher=Walker & Company |year=2003 |pages=35\u201336 |isbn=978-0802714367 }}</ref> Bailly recognized his talent and ambition. By the time he was prepared to leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave his new employer when a better offer came along. Car\u00eame opened his own shop, the ''P\u00e2tisserie de la rue de la Paix'', which he maintained until 1813.\n\nCar\u00eame gained fame in Paris for his ''[[pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly had displayed in the p\u00e2tisserie window. He made these confections, which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. He modeled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural history books which he studied at the nearby [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly.<ref>Kelly (2004), Chapter 2.</ref> He is credited with the inventions of ''gros nougats''<ref>One of the pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es at the dinner served to the Prince Regent and the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, 18 January 1817 ([http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/princeregent3a.html Channel 4 reportage]) was \"Un gros nougat \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise\"; the [[Royal Pavilion]] in sugar was also featured.</ref> and ''grosses meringues'', ''croquantes'', made of almonds and honey, and ''[[Sally Lunn bun#Origins|solilemmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Bernier |title=Antonin Car\u00eame (1783\u20131833): La sensualit\u00e9 en Europe |location=Paris |publisher=B.

While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses.\n\nNapoleon was famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of social relations in the world of diplomacy. In 1804, he gave money to [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] to purchase [[Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay]], a large estate outside Paris. The ch\u00e2teau was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. When Talleyrand moved there, he took Car\u00eame with him.\n\nCar\u00eame was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole year\u2019s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. Car\u00eame passed the test and completed his training in Talleyrand's kitchens. After the fall of Napoleon, Car\u00eame went to London for a time and served as ''chef de cuisine'' to the [[Prince Regent]], later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. Returning to the continent, he accepted the invitation of Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to come to St. Petersburg, but stayed so briefly that he prepared not even a single meal for the Tsar. Upon returning to Paris, he became chef to banker [[James Mayer Rothschild]].<ref>[http://www.soupsong.com/rcareme.html Lady Morgan English fish soup (Creation of the great French Chef Marie Antoine Careme, 1784\u20131833)]</ref>\n\nCar\u00eame died in his Paris house on the Rue Neuve Saint Roche at the age of 48, due perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the coal burning stoves over which he cooked.<ref>Kelly, p. 79, 206</ref> He is remembered as the founder of the haute cuisine concept and is interred in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | title=CAREME Marie Antoine dit Antonin (1784-1833) | access-date=2015-02-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201005314/http://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=1948 | archive-date=2018-12-01 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nIn his first major position, Car\u00eame worked as ''chef de cuisine'' to Talleyrand, who actively encouraged Car\u00eame in the development of a new refined food style using herbs, fresh vegetables, and simplified sauces with few ingredients. Talleyrand became a famous host during the [[Congress of Vienna]]\u2014by the time the congress disbanded, not only the map of Europe but also the culinary tastes of its upper classes had been thoroughly revised.\n\nCar\u00eame's impact on culinary matters ranged from trivial to theoretical. He is credited with creating the standard chef's hat, the ''[[Toque (French)#Culinary use|toque]]'', he designed new sauces and dishes, and he published a classification of all sauces into groups based on four [[mother sauces]].<ref name=\"Car\u00eame1854\">{{cite book|last=Car\u00eame|first=Marie Antonin|year=1854|title=L'art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle|volume=3|publisher=Au Depot de librairie|location=Paris|language=French|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0543991261|page=1|accessdate=7 December 2013}}</ref> He is also frequently credited with replacing the practice of ''[[service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]]'' (serving all dishes at once) with ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' (serving each dish in the order printed on the menu) after he returned from service in the Russian court,<ref>\"...Service \u00e0 la russe [,] the style Car\u00eame helped to import from Russia...\": Kelly, p. 13</ref> but others say he was a diehard supporter of ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise''.<ref>{{cite journal |quote=Car\u00eame made a final stand for the elaborate ''service \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise'', arguing for its superiority with his elaborate ''pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es'' |first=John |last=Fischer |title=Table Service |journal=Gastronomica |year=2001 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=90\u201391 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2001.1.3.90 }}</ref>\n\n==Works by Car\u00eame==\nCar\u00eame wrote several books on cookery,  above all the encyclopedic ''L'Art de la Cuisine Fran\u00e7aise'' (5 vols, 1833\u201334, of which he had completed three before his death), which included, aside from hundreds of recipes, plans for menus and opulent table settings, a history of French cookery, and instructions for organizing kitchens.\n\n* ''Le P\u00e2tissier royal parisien, ou Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et pratique de la p\u00e2tisserie moderne, suivi d'observations utiles au progr\u00e8s de cet art, et d'une revue critique des grands bals de 18\n* ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais, ou Parall\u00e8le de la cuisine ancienne et moderne, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sous rapport de l'ordonnance des menus selon les quatre saisons.''

Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.<ref name=\"RG15\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG16\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.<ref name=\"RG17\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG18\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n== Order of

Vincent]] between a Liberal fleet under the command of British naval officer [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] against a [[Miguelist|Miguelite]] fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the [[Liberal Wars]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the Liberal fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelites fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelites fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelites fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelites fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelites prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.<ref name=\"RG15\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG16\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.<ref name=\"RG17\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG18\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n== Order of

It was released on 3 March 2010 by [[Parlophone]] internationally and by [[Virgin Records]] in the United States. Conceived from an unfinished project called ''Carousel'', the album was recorded from June 2008 to November 2009, and was produced primarily by group co-creator [[Damon Albarn]]. It features guest appearances by such artists as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Gruff Rhys]], [[De La Soul]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[Mos Def]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Mark E. Smith]], [[Paul Simonon]], [[Bashy]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Yukimi Nagano]], and the [[Hypnotic Brass Ensemble]].\n\n''Plastic Beach'' received mostly positive reviews, and was later named one of the decade's best albums by several critics. The album debuted at number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]], selling approximately 74,432 copies in its first week. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 112,000 copies sold in its first week; it also reached number one in several other countries.\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Carousel''===\nCreators of [[Gorillaz]], musician [[Damon Albarn]] and artist [[Jamie Hewlett]], began working on a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called ''Carousel'',<ref name=\"Q 2007\" /> which evolved into ''Plastic Beach'', the group's third studio album.<ref name=\"guardian 2009\">{{cite news|last=Morley|first=Paul|url=http://audio.theguardian.tv/audio/kip/music/series/paul-morley-showing-off/1259329339795/8827/AlbarnMorleyFINAL.mp3|title=Paul Morley's Showing Off...

[...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. It was a strange kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important.\"<ref name=\"guardian 2009\" />\n\nAlbarn says the album maintains a lot of the melancholy from ''Carousel''.<ref name=\"guardian 2009\" /> He worked hard on making his lyrics and melodies clear on the album.<ref name=\"guardian 2009\" /> \"Loads of orchestral stuff\" was recorded but only a fraction made it onto the final album.<ref name=\"guardian 2009\" /> On 14 January 2009 [[Damon Albarn]] appeared on [[BBC Radio 1]] with animated bass player [[Murdoc Niccals]], and played a selection of songs including four demos for ''Plastic Beach'': \"Electric Shock\", which features Derby-based Orchestra [[sinfonia ViVA]] (a song which does not appear on the album, although certain elements of it were used in \"[[Rhinestone Eyes]]\"), the demo for \"[[Stylo (song)|Stylo]]\" (which was named \"Binge\" at that point) and the demo for \"Broken\".\n\n==Release and promotion==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Gorillaz Plastic Beach.svg|thumb|175px|alt=On a black background is red uppercase text in a thick wavy font.

On 14 January 2010, Albarn made an appearance as a guest DJ on [[BBC Radio 1]], premiering demos of three new Gorillaz songs&nbsp;\u2014 \"Electric Shock\", \"Broken\" and \"Stylo\".<ref name=Newsbeat>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7829000/7829878.stm |title=Gorillaz tracks debuted by Damon |accessdate=17 January 2009 |last=Cochrane |first=Greg |date=15 January 2009 |work=[[Newsbeat]] |publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5my25IejA?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7829000/7829878.stm |archivedate=22 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> \"Stylo\" was heavily edited for its final version, while \"Broken\" remained mostly unchanged. \"Electric Shock\" did not make the album, though samples of the song were used in \"Rhinestone Eyes\", as well as the intro orchestral separated into bonus track \"Three Hearts, Seven Seas, Twelve Moons\".\n\nOn 20 January 2010, the official Gorillaz website was heavily revamped to fit the ''Plastic Beach'' theme. Over a period of time, numerous short clips were posted on the site, mainly showing various shots of a large Plastic Beach<!-- The place, not the album --> model backed by segments of new Gorillaz music. Out of the 13 short clips, only two of the clips had audio that would eventually end up on the album. The tracks were \"White Flag\" and \"Pirate's Progress\" (an extended version of the Orchestral Intro found on the album). Also on the website was a countdown timer, which on 23 February 2010 counted down to zero. After a significant delay, a new full Kong studios-esque interactive ''Plastic Beach'' \"Beachsite\" was uploaded onto the website, opening certain sections of Plastic Beach<!-- The place, not the album --> to be visited by guests.\n\nOn 21 January 2010, Gorillaz member Murdoc \"took over\" [[NME Radio]] and [[Yahoo!]] Radio. He played a 45-minute set of songs while providing exposition on the story of Gorillaz. A total of four broadcasts were uploaded online, leading to the release of the album. All four were available on the official Gorillaz website.\n\nSimilar to the previous album, short animated \"idents\" have been released for fictional band members Murdoc, 2D, Russel, and the Noodle cyborg. The first depicts Murdoc fleeing from an unknown, rifle-wielding assailant (featuring a clip of \"Three Hearts, Seven Seas, Twelve Moons\" in the background), and the second depicts 2D's abduction and transportation to Plastic Beach by a masked figure, who according to the Boogeyman (with a snippet of the instrumental version of \"Rhinestone Eyes\"). The track can be found as a bonus track along with \"Pirate's Progress\" on the iTunes Deluxe edition. Russel's ident has him stomping off of the edge of a pier and diving into the ocean, presumably headed to Plastic Beach for reasons unknown. The fourth features a zoom in on Cyborg Noodle with its face plate open. A fifth ident was also released, showing a luxury cruise sail being bombarded by torpedoes coming from planes flying above it. A crew member rushes over to cabin 13 to warn a passenger, who is revealed to be Noodle (wearing the oni mask), that the cruise is under attack by pirates and he was told to escort her to the lifeboats. Noodle then grabs her briefcase and opens it, revealing a gun, and passes the crew member while heading out, presumably to face the pirates. Noodle's ident acts as a trailer to the \"On Melancholy Hill\" music video, which was released on 15 June.\n\nOn 26 February 2010, a \"minimix\" of the album was made available on the official website to download for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillaz.com/f/album-mix/ |title=Plastic Beach \u2013 Album Mixtape 2010 |publisher=Gorillaz |accessdate=28 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228165749/http://gorillaz.com/f/album-mix/ |archivedate=28 February 2010  }}</ref> The minimix is an eight-minute composition of songs from the album, a number of which had not been previously released.\n\n\"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\", \"Rhinestone Eyes\" and \"White Flag\" were premiered on the Australian radio station [[Triple J]] on 28 February 2010, in respective order, at one-hour intervals.

It was released on 3 March 2010 by [[Parlophone]] internationally and by [[Virgin Records]] in the United States. Conceived from an unfinished project called ''Carousel'', the album was recorded from June 2008 to November 2009, and was produced primarily by group co-creator [[Damon Albarn]]. It features guest appearances by such artists as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Gruff Rhys]], [[De La Soul]], [[Bobby Womack]], [[Mos Def]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]], [[Mark E. Smith]], [[Paul Simonon]], [[Bashy]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Yukimi Nagano]], and the [[Hypnotic Brass Ensemble]].\n\n''Plastic Beach'' received mostly positive reviews, and was later named one of the decade's best albums by several critics. The album debuted at number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]], selling approximately 74,432 copies in its first week. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 112,000 copies sold in its first week; it also reached number one in several other countries.\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Carousel''===\nCreators of [[Gorillaz]], musician [[Damon Albarn]] and artist [[Jamie Hewlett]], began working on a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called ''Carousel'',<ref name=\"Q 2007\" /> which evolved into ''Plastic Beach'', the group's third studio album.<ref name=\"guardian 2009\">{{cite news|last=Morley|first=Paul|url=http://audio.theguardian.tv/audio/kip/music/series/paul-morley-showing-off/1259329339795/8827/AlbarnMorleyFINAL.mp3|title=Paul Morley's Showing Off...

There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever.

I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it.

Over a period of time, numerous short clips were posted on the site, mainly showing various shots of a large Plastic Beach<!-- The place, not the album --> model backed by segments of new Gorillaz music. Out of the 13 short clips, only two of the clips had audio that would eventually end up on the album. The tracks were \"White Flag\" and \"Pirate's Progress\" (an extended version of the Orchestral Intro found on the album). Also on the website was a countdown timer, which on 23 February 2010 counted down to zero. After a significant delay, a new full Kong studios-esque interactive ''Plastic Beach'' \"Beachsite\" was uploaded onto the website, opening certain sections of Plastic Beach<!-- The place, not the album --> to be visited by guests.\n\nOn 21 January 2010, Gorillaz member Murdoc \"took over\" [[NME Radio]] and [[Yahoo!]] Radio. He played a 45-minute set of songs while providing exposition on the story of Gorillaz. A total of four broadcasts were uploaded online, leading to the release of the album. All four were available on the official Gorillaz website.\n\nSimilar to the previous album, short animated \"idents\" have been released for fictional band members Murdoc, 2D, Russel, and the Noodle cyborg. The first depicts Murdoc fleeing from an unknown, rifle-wielding assailant (featuring a clip of \"Three Hearts, Seven Seas, Twelve Moons\" in the background), and the second depicts 2D's abduction and transportation to Plastic Beach by a masked figure, who according to the Boogeyman (with a snippet of the instrumental version of \"Rhinestone Eyes\"). The track can be found as a bonus track along with \"Pirate's Progress\" on the iTunes Deluxe edition. Russel's ident has him stomping off of the edge of a pier and diving into the ocean, presumably headed to Plastic Beach for reasons unknown. The fourth features a zoom in on Cyborg Noodle with its face plate open. A fifth ident was also released, showing a luxury cruise sail being bombarded by torpedoes coming from planes flying above it. A crew member rushes over to cabin 13 to warn a passenger, who is revealed to be Noodle (wearing the oni mask), that the cruise is under attack by pirates and he was told to escort her to the lifeboats. Noodle then grabs her briefcase and opens it, revealing a gun, and passes the crew member while heading out, presumably to face the pirates. Noodle's ident acts as a trailer to the \"On Melancholy Hill\" music video, which was released on 15 June.\n\nOn 26 February 2010, a \"minimix\" of the album was made available on the official website to download for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillaz.com/f/album-mix/ |title=Plastic Beach \u2013 Album Mixtape 2010 |publisher=Gorillaz |accessdate=28 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228165749/http://gorillaz.com/f/album-mix/ |archivedate=28 February 2010  }}</ref> The minimix is an eight-minute composition of songs from the album, a number of which had not been previously released.\n\n\"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\", \"Rhinestone Eyes\" and \"White Flag\" were premiered on the Australian radio station [[Triple J]] on 28 February 2010, in respective order, at one-hour intervals.
