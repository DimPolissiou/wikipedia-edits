It is the 2019 entry in the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise. The show follows Devon Daniels (Rorrie D. Travis), Ravi Shaw (Jazz Baduwalia), Zoey Reeves (Jacqueline Scislowski), Nate Silva (Abraham Rodriguez) and Steel (voiced by [[Jamie Linehan]]) as they are recruited by Grid Battleforce to defend the Morphing Grid from Evox.\n\n==Beast Morpher Power Rangers==\nThe Beast Morpher Rangers are a government-funded team formed by Grid Battleforce by mixing Morph-X substance with animal DNA. Blaze and Roxy were the original candidates for the Red and Yellow Rangers until Evox corrupted the Morph-X and infected their bodies; cloning them into his loyal Avatars while the real ones are rendered comatose. Following this, Devon and Zoey took their place by accident. However, their Morph-X that were semi-corrupted by Evox causing them to receive varying weaknesses. The Rangers transform with using Beast-X Morphers in conjunction with Morph-X Keys and each wield a Beast-X Blaster and Saber, which can be combined to form the Beast-X Cannon. In season 2, Nate developed the Beast-X Visors, which allow Devon, Ravi, and Zoe to combine with their Beast Bot partners and assume Beast-X Mode to enhance their animal powers.\n\n===Devon Daniels===\n'''Devon Daniels''' is the leader of the Beast Morpher Rangers and the son of Mayor Adam Daniels. Originally, he wasn't meant to be the Red Ranger as he wasn't associated with Grid Battleforce. After he snuck in and witnessed Evox's first attack, he became the Red Ranger.\nHe's the Mayor's son\n\nAs the Red Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with [[cheetah]] DNA, which allows him to move at superhuman speeds. Due to Evox's corruption however, he will instantly become frozen whenever he sees or hear anything related to dogs.\n\nDevon controls the Racer Zord which has a car mode, a cheetah mode, and a humanoid battle mode. While piloting the Racer Zord, Devon can access the Cheetah Beast Blaster to destroy Gigadrones. In season 2, Devon gains control of the Beast-X King Zord which has a motorcycle form, a [[lion]] form, and a Megazord form.\n\nDevon temporarily acquired a battlizer called Red Fury Mode, which enhanced his strength. As it ran on Fury Cells that slowly corrupted him however, he was forced to discard it.\n\nDevon Daniels is portrayed by Rorrie D. Travis.<ref name=\"BeastMorphersCast\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/powerrangers/2018/08/18/power-rangers-beast-morphers-cast-revealed|title='Power Rangers Beast Morphers' Cast Revealed|website=comicbook.com|date=August 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Ravi Shaw===\n'''Ravi Shaw''' is a Grid Battleforce cadet and son of Commander Shaw. Ravi was in a relationship with Roxy before he broke up with her to embrace his duties as a Ranger. He later feels guilty for pushing her aside after her Avatar's creation left her comatose. He is the only original candidate who survived Evox's first attack.\n\nAs the Blue Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with [[gorilla]] DNA, which gives him superhuman strength. Due to Evox's corruption, Ravi will overheat and become enraged whenever he overuses his powers; attacking friend and foe alike.\n\nRavi controls the Wheeler Zord which has a truck mode and a gorilla mode.\n\nRavi Shaw is portrayed by Jasmeet \"Jazz\" Baduwalia.<ref name=\"BeastMorphersCast\" />\n\n===Zoey Reeves===\n'''Zoey Reeves''' is a former [[Washerwoman|laundry girl]] at Grid Battleforce who became the Yellow Ranger after Roxy was rendered comatose. Zoey displays an optimistic approach to solving problems.\n\nAs the Yellow Beast Morpher Ranger, she was fused with [[Hare|jackrabbit]] DNA, which gives her powerful jumping and kicking abilities. Due to Evox's corruption, Zoey will become exhausted over time and must consume carrots to replenish her energy.\n\nZoey controls the Chopper Zord which has a helicopter mode and a jackrabbit mode.\n\nZoey Reeves is portrayed by Jacqueline Scislowski.<ref name=\"BeastMorphersCast\" />\n\n===Nate Silva===\nNate Silva is a child prodigy, chief researcher, and head of technology at Grid Battleforce. He developed Morph-X for use as a clean, sustainable energy source and created the Beast Morpher Rangers' powers and arsenal. Being a genius, Nate is a quick thinker in situations that require it; such as when he gave Devon, Ravi, and Zoey their powers to protect the Morphing Grid.\n\nWhen he was kidnapped by the Avatars and forced to build a robot body for Evox, Nate was able to subvert the plot by fusing himself with [[mantis]] DNA, which allows him to use martial arts, and become the Gold Ranger. Following this, he officially joined the other Rangers in the field.\n\nNate pilots the Wrecker Zord which has a [[mobile crane|crane truck]] mode, a mantis mode, and a humanoid warrior mode.\n\nNate Silva is portrayed by Abraham Rodriguez.<ref name=\"BeastMorphersCast\" />\n\n===Steel===\n'''Steel''' is a [[stag beetle]]/[[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]]-like android whom Nate built after he was captured by Cybervillain Blaze and Cybervillain Roxy and forced to build a robot body for the Evox from the parts that Scrozzle stole from the hangar that a deactivated Slicerdrone was briefly held in. When Nate subverted their plot, he inadvertently fused said robot body with scarab beetle DNA and his human DNA. As a result, \"Steel\" became the Silver Ranger as well as a \"brother\" of sorts to Nate.\n\nAs the Silver Beast Morpher Ranger, he was fused with scarab DNA, granting him superhuman stamina.\nSteel controls the Jet Zord which has a jet mode and a scarab beetle mode.\n\nSteel is performed by Reid McGowan and voiced by [[Jamie Linehan]].<!--REMOVE WHEN THEIR RESPECTFUL DEBUT HAPPENS\n\n===Legendary Rangers===\n* '''[[Jason Lee Scott]]''' - He is the Red Ranger from [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thathashtagshow.com/2019/05/02/exclusive-austin-st-john-set-to-return-for-team-up-in-power-rangers-beast-morphers/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Austin St. John Set To Return For Team-Up In POWER RANGERS: Beast Morphers|last=Deckelmeier|first=Joe|date=2019-05-02|website=That Hashtag Show|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''[[Zack Taylor]]''' - He is the Black Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''[[Billy Cranston]]''' - He is the Blue Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''Aisha Campbell''' - She is the second Yellow Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''[[Kimberly Ann Hart]]''' - She is the Pink Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n* '''Connor McKnight''' - He is the Red Dino Ranger from [[Power Rangers Dino Thunder]].\n* '''Ethan James''' - He is the Blue Dino Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Kira Ford''' - She is the Yellow Dino Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''[[Tommy Oliver]]''' - He is the Black Dino Thunder Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Trent Fernandez-Mercer''' - He is the White Dino Thunder Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Thunder.\n* '''Tyler Navarro''' - He is the Red Dino Charge Ranger from [[Power Rangers Dino Charge]].<ref name=\"DinoCharge\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/power-rangers-dino-charge-beast-morphers-teamup/|title=Power Rangers Dino Charge Cast Returning For Beast Morphers|website=Power Rangers NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''Chase Randall''' - He is the Black Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/power-rangers-dino-charge-beast-morphers-teamup/|title=Power Rangers Dino Charge Cast Returning For Beast Morphers|website=Power Rangers NOW|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n* '''Koda''' - A [[caveman]] who is the Blue Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\" />\n* '''Riley Griffin''' - He is the Green Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n* '''Shelby Watkins''' - She is the Pink Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.\n* '''Sir Ivan of Zandar''' - A [[knight]] from medieval times is the Gold Dino Charge Ranger from Power Rangers Dino Charge.<ref name=\"DinoCharge\" />-->\n\n==Grid Battleforce==\n'''Grid Battleforce''' is a secret organization that was created to use Morph-X and to keep their enemies from gaining control of the Morphin Grid.\n\n===Commander Shaw===\n'''Commander Shaw''' is the head commander of Grid Battleforce and Ravi's mother.\n\nCommander Shaw is portrayed by [[Teuila Blakely]].\n\n===Beast Bots===\nThe Beasts Bots are the robotic partners of the Beast Morpher Rangers. Each one was developed based on their Rangers' animal motifs. When combined with the Rangers' Zords, the Beast Bots provide a Beast Mode while their heads take on the form of control devices. In season two, Nate developed the Beast-X Visor, which can digitize the Beast Bots and transform them into armor for their Ranger partners' Beast-X Modes.\n\n* '''Cruise''' (voiced by Kelson Henderson) - He is the cheetah-like partner of Devon who suffers from short-term memory loss.

While he acts sternly, he cares for his children and has childish moments.\n\nIn \"Beast King Rampage,\" General Burke headed up the development of the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X Towers without Commander Shaw's knowledge and with Mayor Daniels' approval. Furthermore, he rehired Megan to assist in it's engineering.\n\nGeneral Burke is portrayed by [[Mark Wright (actor)|Mark Wright]].\n\n===Blaze===\n'''Blaze''' is a karate instructor at Riptide Gym and the original Red Ranger candidate. He develops a rivalry with Devon when they get into a karate match, during which Devon defeated him. While becoming the Red Ranger, Blaze gets put into a coma when Evox corrupts the process and creates an avatar based on him. When his avatar is destroyed, Blaze comes out of his coma and shows some respect to Devon; becoming fast friends.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent death, Blaze continued his karate instructor job. He and Roxy were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them for their DNA. Following Trapperdrone's destruction, Blaze and Roxy learned that Scrozzle created robot clones of them.\n\nBlaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.\n\n===Roxy===\n'''Roxy''' is the original Yellow Ranger candidate and Ravi's girlfriend. Before the series took place, they were in a relationship until Ravi broke up with her to focus on their ranger duties. While becoming the Yellow Ranger, Roxy gets put into a coma when Evox corrupts the process and creates an Avatar based on her.\n\nWhen her avatar is destroyed, Roxy comes out of her coma. As she wakes up, she reveals that her mind was still connected to her evil counterpart. As such, she learned that Scrozzle was building a robot body for Evox so that he can teleport to Coral Harbor and destroy it. Roxy and Ravi got back together again afterwards.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent destruction, Roxy goes to work for her Aunt Regina at Collins Industries. She and Blaze were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them. Following Trapperdrone's destruction, Roxy and Blaze learned that Scrozzle created robot clones of them.\n\nRoxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.\n\n===Megan===\n'''Megan''' is a Grid Battleforce technician who attempted to steal Nate's job through dishonest means, such as blackmailing Zoey to get close to him before sabotaging one of his experiments to make him look incompetent. After her deception was revealed, she was immediately fired.\n\nIn season two, Megan returned months later after joining General Burke's secret project to create the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X towers; overseeing the designing and programming herself. After Evox's minions corrupted it with a virus, Megan reconciled with Nate and the Rangers before helping them regain control of the Zord. Following this, she is welcomed back to Grid Battleforce.\n\nMegan is portrayed by Madeleine Adams.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Adam Daniels===\n'''Adam Daniels''' is Devon's father and the strict but responsible [[Mayor]] of Coral Harbor who cares for his son. He was initially against the use of Morph-X as villains from other dimensions have attacked while targeting the Morphin Grid for its vast power, until he learned Grid Battleforce created the Beast Morpher Rangers to protect it and changed his mind. During the season one finale, he became possessed by Evox after braving the Cyber Dimension to save his son.\n\nAdam Daniels is portrayed by Kevin Copeland.\n\n===Muriel Reeves===\n'''Muriel Reeves''' is the mother of Zoey and a [[Journalist|reporter]] for News Channel 10.\n\nMuriel Reeves is portrayed by Sia Trokenheim.\n\n===Regina Collins===\n'''Regina Collins''' is Roxy's aunt and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Collins Industries.\n\nRegina Collins is portrayed by [[Miriama Smith]].\n\n==Villains==\n===Evox===\n'''Evox''' is a sentient [[computer virus]] that speaks through the avatar of a [[king cobra]] that he can project into the real world. Evox infiltrated Grid Battleforce's computer systems so he could take over the Morphin Grid. His actions caused the creations of evil [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] clones of Blaze and Roxy, put the real ones into comas, and corrupted the Rangers' animal DNA. With help from Devon, Ravi, and Zoey, Nate was able to disconnect Evox from the system and teleported him and the Cybervillains to another dimension. The three of them landed in the Cyber Dimension, where they formed an alliance with Scrozzle, and later Vargoyle, in order to obtain enough Morph-X to send Evox back to Coral Harbor.\n\nAfter stealing a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle begins to work on a robot body for Evox. Once he has it, Evox takes on the Rangers and overpowers them; destroying most of their Zords, though the Racer Zord survived. Believing the Rangers couldn't threaten him anymore, Evox starts to teleport back to the real world. However, Nate blocks him in the Cyber-Dimension and Devon's able to use the Racer Zord to destroy the stolen tower as well as Evox's body. Despite this, Evox survived by possessing Mayor Daniels, who came to the Cyber Dimension to rescue his son.\n\nEver since, Evox has secretly worked to collect Morph-X once more to continue his plans and maintain control over his host. As Scrozzle warns, he has to ensure he has enough or else he'll transform back to his true form unwillingly.\n\nEvox is voiced by Richard Ewing.\n\n===Cybervillain Blaze===\n'''Cybervillain Blaze''' is the Evil Crimson Ranger and an Avatar of the human Blaze. While Blaze was in the middle of becoming the Red Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing him into a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on him to serve him. Cybervillain Blaze inherited his human template's rivalry with Devon after he was humiliated at the Riptide Gym.\n\nAfter a series of schemes and plots, he and Cybervillain Roxy succeeded in stealing a Morph-X Tower so Scrozzle could use it to build Evox a robot body and send him back to Coral Harbor. When the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension to destroy the tower, Blaze piloted a Megazord Scrozzle built to stop them; only to be defeated by Devon in the Racer Zord. As a result of the avatar's defeat, the real Blaze awakens from his coma.\n\nCybervillain Blaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/new-power-rangers-beast-morphers-cast-announced/|title=New Power Rangers Beast Morphers Cast Announced|website=PowerRangersNow|author=Staff|date=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cybervillain Roxy===\n'''Cybervillain Roxy''' is the Evil Yellow Ranger and an Avatar of the human Roxy. While Roxy was in the middle of becoming the Yellow Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing her in a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on her to serve her. As Roxy's human counterpart was originally in a relationship with Ravi before he broke up with her to focus on his Ranger duties, the Avatar used this to her advantage to weaken Ravi's resolve on various occasions.\n\nWhen Evox concocts a plan to teleport a Morph-X Tower to the Cyber Dimension, Cybervillain Roxy engages the Blue Ranger so Cybervillain Blaze can steal three mega transporters required for the plan. After destroying her morpher, Ravi succeeds in destroying Cybervillain Roxy; allowing the real Roxy to awaken from her coma.\n\nCybervillain Roxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\"/>\n\n===Scrozzle===\n'''Scrozzle''' is a robot and the de facto ruler of the Cyber Dimension after he hid out there from Vargoyle. When Evox and the Cybervillains arrived in the Cyber Dimension, Scrozzle reluctantly formed an alliance with them; lending them his gadgetry skills, Tronics, Robotrons, and Gigadrones.\n\nHe uses his talents to create teleporters to travel between the Cyber Dimension and Coral Harbor, re-purpose Morph-X Keys for the Cybervillains to transform, create Robotrons via the Robotron-Maker, and create giant Gigadrones that feed on Morph-X. Scrozzle dislikes having to work with the Cybervillains as he views them as incompetent, though he did work with them once to betray Vargoyle.\n\nAfter the Cybervillains successfully stole a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle began construction on Evox's new robot body before preparing to teleport him back to the real world. However, the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension and foiled the latter plot, though Scrozzle was able to escape with his Robotron-Maker.\n\nScrozzle later planned his revenge against the Rangers by attacking them on Christmas and turn them into ornaments. He nearly succeeded, but Steel and the Beast Bots were able to foil his plan by freeing the Rangers. In response, Scrozzle unleashed Infernodrone and piloted it directly. Scrozzle was seemingly destroyed when Cruise used the Racer Zord to destroy Infernodrone.\n\nIn season 2 however, Scrozzle survived his apparent destruction by ejecting from Infernodrone so he can continue serving Evox. In between seasons, they commandeered a crystalline dimension as their new base. To fill out their ranks, Scrozzle scanned Blaze and Roxy for their DNA so he could combine it with back-up data on the fallen Cybervillains and spare robot parts to create robot versions of them. To ensure they survive, he also programmed the machine that built them to recreate their bodies when they fall in battle.\n\nScrozzle is voiced by [[Campbell Cooley]].\n\n===Vargoyle===\nVargoyle is a [[Raygun|laser gun]]-themed robot who was built by Scrozzle. After using several Fury Cells on himself, he became more evil than his creator and turned on him; forcing Scrozzle to take refuge in the Cyber Dimension.\n\nVargoyle is not seen in the series until late into season one, when he finally catches up to Scrozzle to take the remaining Fury Cells. After defeating the Cybervillains, Evox recruits him into his ranks while offering a reward if he proved himself against the Rangers. Once he did, Vargoyle received an upgrade originally meant for the Avatars, who put aside their differences to get payback. Vargoyle continued to prove himself to Evox by easily defeating the Rangers in a second fight and building a weapon from a blueprint he stole from the Avatars for his master plan. After creating Shockatron and Shockadrone to distract the Rangers, Vargoyle used his Memory Pulsator to alter Coral Harbor's citizens' memories so the Avatars could steal three mega-transporters. Though the Rangers failed to stop the Avatars, Devon was able to destroy Vargoyle after he was betrayed by his allies.\n\nVargoyle is voiced by Jamie Linehan.\n\n===Robo-Blaze===\n'''Robo-Blaze''' is a robot clone created by Scrozzle from Cybervillain Blaze's back-up data, spare robot parts, and the real Blaze's DNA.

It can fire explosive needles, possesses super-strength, and drain Morph-X. Needledrone tried to steal Morph-X from a Morph-X Tower, only to be stopped by the Beast Wheeler Zord. Needledrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Shoveldrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Shoveltron's arms and missiles. After getting Shoveltron's data from Scrozzle, Shoveldrone was dispatched to assist its Robotron counterpart in attacking Coral Harbor. While Zoey and Ravi fight Shoveltron, Devon used the Beast Racer Zord to fight Shoveldrone. After Shoveltron was destroyed, Shoveldrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Slicerdrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone equipped with Slicertron's saw arm. In addition to its saw attacks, it can also project a shield, absorb Morph-X with its optics, and shoot bullets from its left arm. After getting Slicertron's data from Scrozzle, Slicerdrone was dispatched to help the Robotron fight the Rangers. The Beast Racer Zord shut down Slicerdrone, which was then transported to a secret hangar. In \"Hangar Heist,\" Nate conducted research on the deactivated Slicerdrone in order to develop a device capable of detecting incoming Gigadrones early. However, Cybervillain Roxy and Meltatron raid the hangar to reboot Slicerdrone to destroy the Rangers. When the Beast Racer Zord redirects Meltadrone's acid attack onto the hangar doors, Slicerdrone emerges and joins the battle. Both of them are destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Meltadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Meltatron's spray arm and chest. Like Meltatron, it can spray an acid mist. When Devon tried to use the Beast Racer Zord to free his fellow Rangers from the hangar holding Slicerdrone, Scrozzle used Meltatron's data to create Meltadrone and stop him. Despite melting the Zord's swords, Devon tricks the Meltadrone into melting the hangar doors open to free the other Rangers and Slicerdrone. Ravi and Zoey summon their Zords to form the Beast-X Megazord and destroy Meltadrone and Slicerdrone.\n* '''Raildrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Railtron's data capable of shooting a beam from his chest and combining with two Gigatronics to perform a powerful ramming attack. To assist Raildrone, Scrozzle also dispatched two Gigatronics. They temporarily overpowered the Beast-X Megazord until the Rangers shot Raildrone and the Gigatronics down and destroyed them.\n* '''Vacuudrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created from Vacuutron's data. Like its Robotron counterpart, it is armed with a vacuum arm capable of draining Morph-X powered machinery. Scrozzle created Vacuudrone to drain Morph-X towers before it was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Antennadrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Antennatron's data to destroy the Rangers. While it wields an antenna staff like its Robotron counterpart, it can fire missiles that release Gigatronics to aid it. Devon engaged Antennadrone in his Racer Zord, but was overpowered until Nate and Steel arrived in the Wrecker Zord and Jet Zord respectively to aid him. After Nate and Steel defeated the Gigatronics, Devon was able to destroy Antennadrone.\n* '''Drilldrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with Drilltron's drill arms. It can dig underground at super-speed and fire lasers. While Cybervillain Roxy and Drilltron were burrowing from below a Morph-X Tower, the former ordered Scrozzle to create Drilldrone and send it to an entirely different tower as part of a diversion. Overhearing this, Ravi tells Devon and Zoey to intercept it. Taking the Racer and Chopper Zords, Devon and Zoey were ambushed by Drilldrone, which blasted them from below. After Ravi destroyed Drilltron, he was able to join his allies in the Wheeler Zord and help them form the Beast-X Megazord to destroy Drilldrone.\n* '''Tooldrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created from Tooltron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's wrenches and lasers. Tooldrone was dispatched to attack the Rangers. It nearly disabled the Wrecker Zord before Steel arrived in the Jet Zord. Tooldrone was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n** '''Tooldrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Tooldrone carried this Gigadrone in its back to assist it, only to be destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Clonedrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Clonetron's data. Like its Robotron counterpart, it can disguise itself and fire lasers from its chest. After Clonetron blasted the Zord computer, Scrozzle created Clonedrone to take advantage of the Zord-less Rangers. Nate and Steel were able to fix the computer enough to get the Beast Racer Zord deployed so it could confront the Gigadrone. When Ravi and Zoey joined the fight, Clonedrone assumed the Beast Racer Zord's appearance in an attempt to confuse them. After a moment's hesitation, Zoey blasted both of them, revealing Clonedrone before the Rangers formed the Beast-X Megazord to destroy it.\n* '''Tubadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron capable of firing sonic blasts. Scrozzle dispatched this Gigadrone to attack a Morph-X Tower while the Rangers were busy with Tubatron. Once they defeated the Robotron, they intercepted the Gigadrone with a recording of Tubatron's soundwaves to counter its attacks. Devon used the Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone's horns before the Rangers destroyed it with the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Spikedrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Spiketron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's trident hand as well as missiles. While the Rangers were fighting Spiketron, Scrozzle created Spikedrone to attack Coral Harbor. Though Devon and Zoey were able to eventually intercept it, their attacks couldn't faze it. When it unleashed a Delta Model Gigadrone, Ravi entered the battle and helped the other Rangers form the Beast-X Megazord. Due to being low on Morph-X however, the Gigadrones blasted it apart. In response, Nate and Steel intervened in their zords, weakening Spikedrone enough for Ravi to use his Zord's gorilla mode to destroy it.\n** '''Spikedrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Spikedrone carried this Gigadrone within its body to assist it and overpowered the Beast-X Megazord before it was destroyed by the Wrecker and Jet Zords.\n* '''Tubadrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron 2.0 capable of firing sonic blasts.

Despite this, Devon was able to use his Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone 2.0.\n* '''Burnerdrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with a flamethrower for a right hand and wields a candlewick-like blade in battle. After Burnertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Burnerdrone to melt a Morph-X Tower. When Devon intercepted it, Burnerdrone summoned a pair of Gigatronics to assist it. After Devon destroyed them, Nate and Steel arrived in the Striker Megazord and destroyed Burnerdrone before putting out the fire on the Morph-X Tower.\n* '''Turbodrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Turbotron's data equipped with arm blades and Turbotron's chest fan and wings, though it also has electrical optic beams. After Turbotron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Turbodrone to draw the Rangers away from Vargoyle. From the sky, Turbotron used its lightning attacks to keep Devon away while it attacked a Morph-X Tower. As Turbodrone was too high for Devon to reach, he used the Wheeler Zord's gorilla mode as a springboard to get up to the Gigadrone and destroy it.\n* '''Shockadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Shockatron's data that can absorb energy and wields two cotton candy sticks for redirecting energy attacks. While the Rangers were fighting Shockatron, Scrozzle used its data to create Shockadrone and send it as a distraction so that Vargoyle could put the Memory Pulsator in place for a future plot. Nate, Steel, and Devon fought Shockadrone with their respective zords; eventually wearing it down before destroying it.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 1''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone with an arm cannon that was dispatched following Vargoyle's destruction. It was quickly destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 2''' - A \"bobblehead\" Beta Model Gigadrone sent to distract the Rangers while Cybervillain Blaze secured the three mega transporters Evox needed for his latest plot. It was destroyed by the combined efforts of the Racer Zord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Infernodrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with a chest-mounted flamethrower. Following Infernotron's destruction, Scrozzle used its data to create Infernodrone and piloted it directly. As the Rangers were trapped at the time, the Beast Bots had to control the zords by themselves while Steel worked to free the Rangers. Despite releasing two Gigatronics to aid it, Cruise was able to destroy them before destroying Infernodrone itself, though Scrozzle ejected at the last minute.\n* '''Drilldrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with the same abilities as the previous version along with shoulder-mounted drills. It was teleported underground to assist Scrozzle in stealing subterranean stores of Morph-X and deployed four Gigatronics as backup before it was destroyed by the Wrecker Zord.\n* '''Trapperdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot lasers from its wrist-mounted blasters. When Trappertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Trapperdrone to destroy the Rangers. It targeted a Morph-X Tower, but was easily destroyed by the Beast-X Ultrazord's Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Gamerdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot blaster bolts from its projector head and form a dome around itself to drain Morph-X from anything within it. When Gamertron was destroyed, her data was used to create Gamerdrone. As the Beast-X Ultrazord was losing Morph-X inside Gamerdrone's dome, the Rangers destroyed it quickly with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Keydrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart while also wielding Gamerdrone's dome projector. After Keytron failed to weaken Grid Battleforce's defenses and was destroyed, Scrozzle created Keydrone to destroy it. Despite temporarily disabling the Rangers' Ultrazord, the Rangers were able to destroy Keydrone with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Digidrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone. After Digitron was destroyed, Scrozzle saved his data before using it to create Digidrone alongside Controladrone to assist it in battle before it was destroyed by the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Controladrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone that possesses similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart. Controladrone was created using Controlatron's data and deployed by Scrozzle alongside Digidrone to steal Morph-X and fight the Rangers. During the battle, it took control of the Wheeler Zord until Zoey destroyed its puppet. While Digidrone was destroyed by the Striker Megazord, Controladrone was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Alphadrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron with a trident arm. It fought and was destroyed by the Racer Zord.\n* '''Betadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron that wields a dumbbell-esque [[club (weapon)|war club]]. It was destroyed by Gammadrone after Devon tricked the latter into attacking the former.\n* '''Gammadrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron with a [[kickboxing]] inspired fighting style. It was destroyed by the Beast-X King Ultrazord.\n* '''Deltadrone''' - A Delta Model Gigadrone created by Boxertron with a [[boxing]] inspired fighting style.

Blaze and Roxy were the original candidates for the Red and Yellow Rangers until Evox corrupted the Morph-X and infected their bodies; cloning them into his loyal Avatars while the real ones are rendered comatose. Following this, Devon and Zoey took their place by accident. However, their Morph-X that were semi-corrupted by Evox causing them to receive varying weaknesses. The Rangers transform with using Beast-X Morphers in conjunction with Morph-X Keys and each wield a Beast-X Blaster and Saber, which can be combined to form the Beast-X Cannon. In season 2, Nate developed the Beast-X Visors, which allow Devon, Ravi, and Zoe to combine with their Beast Bot partners and assume Beast-X Mode to enhance their animal powers.\n\n===Devon Daniels===\n'''Devon Daniels''' is the leader of the Beast Morpher Rangers and the son of Mayor Adam Daniels.

While he acts sternly, he cares for his children and has childish moments.\n\nIn \"Beast King Rampage,\" General Burke headed up the development of the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X Towers without Commander Shaw's knowledge and with Mayor Daniels' approval. Furthermore, he rehired Megan to assist in it's engineering.\n\nGeneral Burke is portrayed by [[Mark Wright (actor)|Mark Wright]].\n\n===Blaze===\n'''Blaze''' is a karate instructor at Riptide Gym and the original Red Ranger candidate. He develops a rivalry with Devon when they get into a karate match, during which Devon defeated him. While becoming the Red Ranger, Blaze gets put into a coma when Evox corrupts the process and creates an avatar based on him. When his avatar is destroyed, Blaze comes out of his coma and shows some respect to Devon; becoming fast friends.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent death, Blaze continued his karate instructor job. He and Roxy were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them for their DNA.

As she wakes up, she reveals that her mind was still connected to her evil counterpart. As such, she learned that Scrozzle was building a robot body for Evox so that he can teleport to Coral Harbor and destroy it. Roxy and Ravi got back together again afterwards.\n\nFollowing Evox's apparent destruction, Roxy goes to work for her Aunt Regina at Collins Industries. She and Blaze were briefly trapped by Trappertron so that Scrozzle can scan them. Following Trapperdrone's destruction, Roxy and Blaze learned that Scrozzle created robot clones of them.\n\nRoxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.\n\n===Megan===\n'''Megan''' is a Grid Battleforce technician who attempted to steal Nate's job through dishonest means, such as blackmailing Zoey to get close to him before sabotaging one of his experiments to make him look incompetent. After her deception was revealed, she was immediately fired.\n\nIn season two, Megan returned months later after joining General Burke's secret project to create the Beast-X King Zord to protect the global Morph-X towers; overseeing the designing and programming herself. After Evox's minions corrupted it with a virus, Megan reconciled with Nate and the Rangers before helping them regain control of the Zord. Following this, she is welcomed back to Grid Battleforce.\n\nMegan is portrayed by Madeleine Adams.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Adam Daniels===\n'''Adam Daniels''' is Devon's father and the strict but responsible [[Mayor]] of Coral Harbor who cares for his son. He was initially against the use of Morph-X as villains from other dimensions have attacked while targeting the Morphin Grid for its vast power, until he learned Grid Battleforce created the Beast Morpher Rangers to protect it and changed his mind. During the season one finale, he became possessed by Evox after braving the Cyber Dimension to save his son.\n\nAdam Daniels is portrayed by Kevin Copeland.\n\n===Muriel Reeves===\n'''Muriel Reeves''' is the mother of Zoey and a [[Journalist|reporter]] for News Channel 10.\n\nMuriel Reeves is portrayed by Sia Trokenheim.\n\n===Regina Collins===\n'''Regina Collins''' is Roxy's aunt and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Collins Industries.\n\nRegina Collins is portrayed by [[Miriama Smith]].\n\n==Villains==\n===Evox===\n'''Evox''' is a sentient [[computer virus]] that speaks through the avatar of a [[king cobra]] that he can project into the real world. Evox infiltrated Grid Battleforce's computer systems so he could take over the Morphin Grid. His actions caused the creations of evil [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] clones of Blaze and Roxy, put the real ones into comas, and corrupted the Rangers' animal DNA. With help from Devon, Ravi, and Zoey, Nate was able to disconnect Evox from the system and teleported him and the Cybervillains to another dimension. The three of them landed in the Cyber Dimension, where they formed an alliance with Scrozzle, and later Vargoyle, in order to obtain enough Morph-X to send Evox back to Coral Harbor.\n\nAfter stealing a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle begins to work on a robot body for Evox. Once he has it, Evox takes on the Rangers and overpowers them; destroying most of their Zords, though the Racer Zord survived. Believing the Rangers couldn't threaten him anymore, Evox starts to teleport back to the real world. However, Nate blocks him in the Cyber-Dimension and Devon's able to use the Racer Zord to destroy the stolen tower as well as Evox's body. Despite this, Evox survived by possessing Mayor Daniels, who came to the Cyber Dimension to rescue his son.\n\nEver since, Evox has secretly worked to collect Morph-X once more to continue his plans and maintain control over his host. As Scrozzle warns, he has to ensure he has enough or else he'll transform back to his true form unwillingly.\n\nEvox is voiced by Richard Ewing.\n\n===Cybervillain Blaze===\n'''Cybervillain Blaze''' is the Evil Crimson Ranger and an Avatar of the human Blaze. While Blaze was in the middle of becoming the Red Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing him into a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on him to serve him. Cybervillain Blaze inherited his human template's rivalry with Devon after he was humiliated at the Riptide Gym.\n\nAfter a series of schemes and plots, he and Cybervillain Roxy succeeded in stealing a Morph-X Tower so Scrozzle could use it to build Evox a robot body and send him back to Coral Harbor. When the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension to destroy the tower, Blaze piloted a Megazord Scrozzle built to stop them; only to be defeated by Devon in the Racer Zord. As a result of the avatar's defeat, the real Blaze awakens from his coma.\n\nCybervillain Blaze is portrayed by Colby Strong.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.powerrangersnow.com/new-power-rangers-beast-morphers-cast-announced/|title=New Power Rangers Beast Morphers Cast Announced|website=PowerRangersNow|author=Staff|date=September 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cybervillain Roxy===\n'''Cybervillain Roxy''' is the Evil Yellow Ranger and an Avatar of the human Roxy. While Roxy was in the middle of becoming the Yellow Beast Morpher Ranger, Evox corrupted the process; placing her in a coma and creating an evil Avatar based on her to serve her. As Roxy's human counterpart was originally in a relationship with Ravi before he broke up with her to focus on his Ranger duties, the Avatar used this to her advantage to weaken Ravi's resolve on various occasions.\n\nWhen Evox concocts a plan to teleport a Morph-X Tower to the Cyber Dimension, Cybervillain Roxy engages the Blue Ranger so Cybervillain Blaze can steal three mega transporters required for the plan. After destroying her morpher, Ravi succeeds in destroying Cybervillain Roxy; allowing the real Roxy to awaken from her coma.\n\nCybervillain Roxy is portrayed by Liana Ramirez.<ref name=\"SupportingCast\"/>\n\n===Scrozzle===\n'''Scrozzle''' is a robot and the de facto ruler of the Cyber Dimension after he hid out there from Vargoyle. When Evox and the Cybervillains arrived in the Cyber Dimension, Scrozzle reluctantly formed an alliance with them; lending them his gadgetry skills, Tronics, Robotrons, and Gigadrones.\n\nHe uses his talents to create teleporters to travel between the Cyber Dimension and Coral Harbor, re-purpose Morph-X Keys for the Cybervillains to transform, create Robotrons via the Robotron-Maker, and create giant Gigadrones that feed on Morph-X. Scrozzle dislikes having to work with the Cybervillains as he views them as incompetent, though he did work with them once to betray Vargoyle.\n\nAfter the Cybervillains successfully stole a Morph-X Tower, Scrozzle began construction on Evox's new robot body before preparing to teleport him back to the real world. However, the Rangers stormed the Cyber Dimension and foiled the latter plot, though Scrozzle was able to escape with his Robotron-Maker.\n\nScrozzle later planned his revenge against the Rangers by attacking them on Christmas and turn them into ornaments. He nearly succeeded, but Steel and the Beast Bots were able to foil his plan by freeing the Rangers. In response, Scrozzle unleashed Infernodrone and piloted it directly. Scrozzle was seemingly destroyed when Cruise used the Racer Zord to destroy Infernodrone.\n\nIn season 2 however, Scrozzle survived his apparent destruction by ejecting from Infernodrone so he can continue serving Evox. In between seasons, they commandeered a crystalline dimension as their new base. To fill out their ranks, Scrozzle scanned Blaze and Roxy for their DNA so he could combine it with back-up data on the fallen Cybervillains and spare robot parts to create robot versions of them. To ensure they survive, he also programmed the machine that built them to recreate their bodies when they fall in battle.\n\nScrozzle is voiced by [[Campbell Cooley]].\n\n===Vargoyle===\nVargoyle is a [[Raygun|laser gun]]-themed robot who was built by Scrozzle. After using several Fury Cells on himself, he became more evil than his creator and turned on him; forcing Scrozzle to take refuge in the Cyber Dimension.\n\nVargoyle is not seen in the series until late into season one, when he finally catches up to Scrozzle to take the remaining Fury Cells. After defeating the Cybervillains, Evox recruits him into his ranks while offering a reward if he proved himself against the Rangers. Once he did, Vargoyle received an upgrade originally meant for the Avatars, who put aside their differences to get payback. Vargoyle continued to prove himself to Evox by easily defeating the Rangers in a second fight and building a weapon from a blueprint he stole from the Avatars for his master plan. After creating Shockatron and Shockadrone to distract the Rangers, Vargoyle used his Memory Pulsator to alter Coral Harbor's citizens' memories so the Avatars could steal three mega-transporters. Though the Rangers failed to stop the Avatars, Devon was able to destroy Vargoyle after he was betrayed by his allies.\n\nVargoyle is voiced by Jamie Linehan.\n\n===Robo-Blaze===\n'''Robo-Blaze''' is a robot clone created by Scrozzle from Cybervillain Blaze's back-up data, spare robot parts, and the real Blaze's DNA.

After Shoveltron was destroyed, Shoveldrone was destroyed by the Beast Racer Zord.\n* '''Slicerdrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone equipped with Slicertron's saw arm. In addition to its saw attacks, it can also project a shield, absorb Morph-X with its optics, and shoot bullets from its left arm. After getting Slicertron's data from Scrozzle, Slicerdrone was dispatched to help the Robotron fight the Rangers. The Beast Racer Zord shut down Slicerdrone, which was then transported to a secret hangar. In \"Hangar Heist,\" Nate conducted research on the deactivated Slicerdrone in order to develop a device capable of detecting incoming Gigadrones early. However, Cybervillain Roxy and Meltatron raid the hangar to reboot Slicerdrone to destroy the Rangers. When the Beast Racer Zord redirects Meltadrone's acid attack onto the hangar doors, Slicerdrone emerges and joins the battle. Both of them are destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Meltadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone armed with Meltatron's spray arm and chest. Like Meltatron, it can spray an acid mist. When Devon tried to use the Beast Racer Zord to free his fellow Rangers from the hangar holding Slicerdrone, Scrozzle used Meltatron's data to create Meltadrone and stop him. Despite melting the Zord's swords, Devon tricks the Meltadrone into melting the hangar doors open to free the other Rangers and Slicerdrone. Ravi and Zoey summon their Zords to form the Beast-X Megazord and destroy Meltadrone and Slicerdrone.\n* '''Raildrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Railtron's data capable of shooting a beam from his chest and combining with two Gigatronics to perform a powerful ramming attack.

After Nate and Steel defeated the Gigatronics, Devon was able to destroy Antennadrone.\n* '''Drilldrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone armed with Drilltron's drill arms. It can dig underground at super-speed and fire lasers. While Cybervillain Roxy and Drilltron were burrowing from below a Morph-X Tower, the former ordered Scrozzle to create Drilldrone and send it to an entirely different tower as part of a diversion. Overhearing this, Ravi tells Devon and Zoey to intercept it. Taking the Racer and Chopper Zords, Devon and Zoey were ambushed by Drilldrone, which blasted them from below. After Ravi destroyed Drilltron, he was able to join his allies in the Wheeler Zord and help them form the Beast-X Megazord to destroy Drilldrone.\n* '''Tooldrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone created from Tooltron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's wrenches and lasers. Tooldrone was dispatched to attack the Rangers. It nearly disabled the Wrecker Zord before Steel arrived in the Jet Zord. Tooldrone was destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n** '''Tooldrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Tooldrone carried this Gigadrone in its back to assist it, only to be destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Clonedrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Clonetron's data. Like its Robotron counterpart, it can disguise itself and fire lasers from its chest. After Clonetron blasted the Zord computer, Scrozzle created Clonedrone to take advantage of the Zord-less Rangers. Nate and Steel were able to fix the computer enough to get the Beast Racer Zord deployed so it could confront the Gigadrone. When Ravi and Zoey joined the fight, Clonedrone assumed the Beast Racer Zord's appearance in an attempt to confuse them. After a moment's hesitation, Zoey blasted both of them, revealing Clonedrone before the Rangers formed the Beast-X Megazord to destroy it.\n* '''Tubadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron capable of firing sonic blasts. Scrozzle dispatched this Gigadrone to attack a Morph-X Tower while the Rangers were busy with Tubatron. Once they defeated the Robotron, they intercepted the Gigadrone with a recording of Tubatron's soundwaves to counter its attacks. Devon used the Racer Zord to destroy Tubadrone's horns before the Rangers destroyed it with the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Spikedrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Spiketron's data armed with its Robotron counterpart's trident hand as well as missiles. While the Rangers were fighting Spiketron, Scrozzle created Spikedrone to attack Coral Harbor. Though Devon and Zoey were able to eventually intercept it, their attacks couldn't faze it. When it unleashed a Delta Model Gigadrone, Ravi entered the battle and helped the other Rangers form the Beast-X Megazord. Due to being low on Morph-X however, the Gigadrones blasted it apart. In response, Nate and Steel intervened in their zords, weakening Spikedrone enough for Ravi to use his Zord's gorilla mode to destroy it.\n** '''Spikedrone's Delta Model Gigadrone''' - Spikedrone carried this Gigadrone within its body to assist it and overpowered the Beast-X Megazord before it was destroyed by the Wrecker and Jet Zords.\n* '''Tubadrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone created from Tubatron 2.0 capable of firing sonic blasts.

After Burnertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Burnerdrone to melt a Morph-X Tower. When Devon intercepted it, Burnerdrone summoned a pair of Gigatronics to assist it. After Devon destroyed them, Nate and Steel arrived in the Striker Megazord and destroyed Burnerdrone before putting out the fire on the Morph-X Tower.\n* '''Turbodrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Turbotron's data equipped with arm blades and Turbotron's chest fan and wings, though it also has electrical optic beams. After Turbotron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Turbodrone to draw the Rangers away from Vargoyle. From the sky, Turbotron used its lightning attacks to keep Devon away while it attacked a Morph-X Tower. As Turbodrone was too high for Devon to reach, he used the Wheeler Zord's gorilla mode as a springboard to get up to the Gigadrone and destroy it.\n* '''Shockadrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone created from Shockatron's data that can absorb energy and wields two cotton candy sticks for redirecting energy attacks. While the Rangers were fighting Shockatron, Scrozzle used its data to create Shockadrone and send it as a distraction so that Vargoyle could put the Memory Pulsator in place for a future plot. Nate, Steel, and Devon fought Shockadrone with their respective zords; eventually wearing it down before destroying it.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 1''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone with an arm cannon that was dispatched following Vargoyle's destruction. It was quickly destroyed by the Beast-X Megazord.\n* '''Unidentified Gigadrone 2''' - A \"bobblehead\" Beta Model Gigadrone sent to distract the Rangers while Cybervillain Blaze secured the three mega transporters Evox needed for his latest plot. It was destroyed by the combined efforts of the Racer Zord and the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Infernodrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with a chest-mounted flamethrower. Following Infernotron's destruction, Scrozzle used its data to create Infernodrone and piloted it directly.

Despite releasing two Gigatronics to aid it, Cruise was able to destroy them before destroying Infernodrone itself, though Scrozzle ejected at the last minute.\n* '''Drilldrone 2.0''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with the same abilities as the previous version along with shoulder-mounted drills. It was teleported underground to assist Scrozzle in stealing subterranean stores of Morph-X and deployed four Gigatronics as backup before it was destroyed by the Wrecker Zord.\n* '''Trapperdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot lasers from its wrist-mounted blasters. When Trappertron was destroyed, Scrozzle created Trapperdrone to destroy the Rangers. It targeted a Morph-X Tower, but was easily destroyed by the Beast-X Ultrazord's Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Gamerdrone''' - A Beta Model Gigadrone that can shoot blaster bolts from its projector head and form a dome around itself to drain Morph-X from anything within it. When Gamertron was destroyed, her data was used to create Gamerdrone. As the Beast-X Ultrazord was losing Morph-X inside Gamerdrone's dome, the Rangers destroyed it quickly with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Keydrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone with similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart while also wielding Gamerdrone's dome projector. After Keytron failed to weaken Grid Battleforce's defenses and was destroyed, Scrozzle created Keydrone to destroy it. Despite temporarily disabling the Rangers' Ultrazord, the Rangers were able to destroy Keydrone with the Beast-X Ultra Strike.\n* '''Digidrone''' - An Alpha Model Gigadrone. After Digitron was destroyed, Scrozzle saved his data before using it to create Digidrone alongside Controladrone to assist it in battle before it was destroyed by the Striker Megazord.\n* '''Controladrone''' - A Gamma Model Gigadrone that possesses similar abilities as its Robotron counterpart. Controladrone was created using Controlatron's data and deployed by Scrozzle alongside Digidrone to steal Morph-X and fight the Rangers.

So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent.

The game is based on previous [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] that were created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' was first released for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[early access]] beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by [[Microsoft Studios]] for the [[Xbox One]] via its [[Xbox Game Preview]] program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. A [[free-to-play]] mobile version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the [[PlayStation 4]]. ''Battlegrounds'' is one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling]] and [[List of most-played video games|most-played video games]] of all time. {{As of|2019|12}}, the PC and console versions of the game have sold over 60{{nbsp}}million units, in addition to ''PUBG Mobile'' having crossed 600{{nbsp}}million downloads.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was attributed to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese [[video game clone|clones]] also being produced following its success. The game also received several [[Game of the Year]] nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular [[esport]]. The game has also been banned in some countries for allegedly being harmful and addictive to young players.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlegrounds'' is a [[player versus player]] [[shooter game]] in which up to one hundred players fight in a [[battle royale game|battle royale]], a type of large-scale [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing deathmatch]] where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people.

The Gamescom 2017 event demonstrated the issues surrounding the logistics of running a large ''Battlegrounds'' tournament with a large number of players involved, and they had worked alongside ESL to explore how to do this effectively in the future.

Battlegrounds''''' ('''''PUBG''''') is an online multiplayer [[battle royale game]] developed and published by [[PUBG Corporation]], a [[subsidiary]] of South Korean video game company [[Bluehole (company)|Bluehole]]. The game is based on previous [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] that were created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' was first released for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s [[early access]] beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by [[Microsoft Studios]] for the [[Xbox One]] via its [[Xbox Game Preview]] program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. A [[free-to-play]] mobile version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the [[PlayStation 4]]. ''Battlegrounds'' is one of the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling]] and [[List of most-played video games|most-played video games]] of all time. {{As of|2019|12}}, the PC and console versions of the game have sold over 60{{nbsp}}million units, in addition to ''PUBG Mobile'' having crossed 600{{nbsp}}million downloads.\n\n''Battlegrounds'' received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was attributed to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese [[video game clone|clones]] also being produced following its success. The game also received several [[Game of the Year]] nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular [[esport]]. The game has also been banned in some countries for allegedly being harmful and addictive to young players.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Battlegrounds'' is a [[player versus player]] [[shooter game]] in which up to one hundred players fight in a [[battle royale game|battle royale]], a type of large-scale [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing deathmatch]] where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.<ref name=\"polygon guide\" />\n\nEach match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately {{convert|8|xx|8|km|mi}}, {{convert|6|xx|6|km|mi}}, and {{convert|4|xx|4|km|mi}} in size.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Forward |first1=Jordan |title=PUBG new map \u2013 all the latest details on the upcoming snow map, Vikendi |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-maps |website=PCGames |accessdate=March 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331152850/https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-new-maps |archive-date=March 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.<ref name=\"polygon guide\" /> Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay.

Greene said that they would not actively pursue esports until after the game was fully released and that all major [[Software bug|bugs]] were eliminated. The Gamescom 2017 event demonstrated the issues surrounding the logistics of running a large ''Battlegrounds'' tournament with a large number of players involved, and they had worked alongside ESL to explore how to do this effectively in the future. Further, Greene stated there was also the need to establish a format for presenting a ''Battlegrounds'' match to make it interesting to spectators, which he thought would take some time to develop given the nature of the emergent gameplay, comparing it to established first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arena esport games.<ref>{{Cite web

The station was to have the call-sign 2EU, based on the initials of '''E'''lectrical '''U'''tilities. However, before the licence, ''PMG - Broadcasting Station Licence'' No.12, was issued on 7 November 1924, Electrical Utilities advised the PMG that it wished to reverse the initials in the call-sign - thus the licence was issued to 2UE.<ref>copy of the original licence in the collections of Bruce Carty, [[Gosford]], [[New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n====2UE====\n2UE opened on 26 January 1925. The founder of Electrical Utilities and 2EU/2UE was Cecil \"Pa\" Stevenson, who was also 2UE's chief engineer, and one of the most prominent personalities in Australia's early broadcasting history.  Prior to opening 2UE, he had operated experimental station 2IY, as well as working alongside a couple of other early experimenters.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\">Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio History'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/son-2eu-passes</ref>\n\nThe original studio was in the dining room of Stevenson's [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] home; and an 80 feet (24.384 metres) transmitting tower was installed in his back yard. All the equipment was homemade; the studio and equipment costing \u00a3750 ($1,500) to build, and \u00a39 ($18) per week to operate. Within a short time the studios were moved to Stevenson's radio store in [[George Street, Sydney]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nMost programming was provided by [[78 rpm]] recordings or [[player piano]] rolls. It is reputed that whilst changing records or rolls, Stevenson would whistle so as to prevent dead air.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> 2UE was originally on the air daily from 8.00&nbsp;pm to 10.00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\">Walker, R.R., ''The Magic Spark: 50 Years of Radio in Australia'', 1973, The Hawthorn Press, Melbourne</ref> The station is reputed to have broadcast Australia's first radio advertisement.  A local butcher was so disconcerted with the sounds between recordings and piano rolls that he paid Stevenson one shilling (10\u00a2) to substitute his whistling with short talks about the quality of the butcher's meat. One shilling then became the station's standard advertising rate.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\">Griffen-Foley, Bridget, ''Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney</ref>\n\nThere are records of early 2UE broadcasts being picked-up in the US and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n2UE is the oldest current commercial radio station in Australia.<ref>Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio \nHistory'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>2UE was not the first B Class or commercial station in Australia. This honour goes to either [[2CM]] or [[2BE (Sydney)|2BE]], according to one's definition of a B Class station. They both broadcast out of Sydney, and both of these stations were short-lived. Bruce Carty claims that the first B Class station was 2CM, whilst R.R. Walker plumps for 2BE. The second-oldest current commercial radio station on the air is [[2HD]] Newcastle, which made its first broadcast just one day after 2UE.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, through Cecil Stevenson, 2UE experimented with sending pictures by radio using radiovision or [[Television|mechanical television]]. The [[television in Australia|experiments]] were short-lived due to the lack of receivers to pick up\nthe transmissions.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> (Melbourne stations [[3UZ]] and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] also both conducted similar experimental transmissions in 1929.)\n\n===1930s===\n====Broadcast Services Association====\nAs a cost saving measure in the depths of the [[Great Depression]], in December 1935 it was announced that an organisation to be known as Broadcasting Service Association, Limited, would co-ordinate and provide combined production resources for 2UE and [[2GB]], but without owning or operating either station.  On 7 January 1937, it was announced that the two stations would operate as the ''Red Network'' and the ''Blue Network''; a concept which was copied from the US's [[NBC]] network, which operated a [[NBC Red Network|Red Network]] and [[NBC Blue Network|Blue Network]] at this time. However, the concept never transpired in Australia, because in February 1937 2GB announced that it was going to form its own national network, and that eventually led to the formation of the [[Macquarie Media|Macquarie Network]] in 1938<ref>see also [[The Labor Daily]] \u2013 http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/237442801</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230799639 |title=Radio Network System |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=8457 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 February 1937 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> which was at first jointly managed by 2GB and 2UE.<ref name=company>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229134023 |title=Radio Company Formed |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=1841 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 July 1938 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n====Major Broadcasting Network====\nIn 1938 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] Melbourne launched the [[Major Broadcasting Network]] which for many decades was Australia's second most important radio network, after the Macquarie Network. The main person behind the formation of the Major Network was [[David Thomas Worrall|David Worrall]], manager of 3DB, and a most important figure in broadcasting history.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/worrall-david-thomas-12074</ref><ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\nThe Major Network's Sydney outlet later changed from 2UE to [[2CH]] and then to [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] before 2UE yet again became the Major Network outlet in Sydney in September 1950<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230472085 |title=Drug addict's struggle back to happiness |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=12,681 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1950 |accessdate=29 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\nThe Network broadcast a wide range of live variety programs including quizzes and [[radio drama|dramas]] including [[soap operas]], mostly emanating from the 3DB or 2UE studios.<ref>Jones, Colin, ''Something in the Air: A History of Radio in Australia'', Kangaroo Press, 1995.</ref>\n\nThe formation of the Major Network actually happened after two earlier attempts by David Worrall to form a network with 2UE as the Sydney station. In 1933, a loose grouping, but the first Australian attempt to form a commercial network, was attempted, known as the Federal Network. Then, in 1933 the Associated Broadcasters of Australia was formed but, again, did not last long.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\n====Accommodation====\nIn 1938 2UE and 2GB, as partners in the newly formed Broadcast Services Association moved their studios and offices to Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney,<ref name=company/> with 2UE on the 4th and 5th floors and [[2GB]] on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\nIn 1930 a new transmitter was installed at [[Lilli Pilli, New South Wales|Lilli Pilli]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Ownership====\nIn 1933\u201334 Stevenson sold the station to Associated Newspapers Ltd, publishers of [[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]].<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Time Signal====\nIn 1938 the station was commencing its broadcasts at 6.00&nbsp;am with ''The Alarm Clock''.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nFrom 1939, 2UE became the first Australian station to broadcast six pips from the Australian [[observatory]] as an hourly [[time signal]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> For many decades all Australian stations carried the six pip time signal first heard on 2UE, and some stations still do.\n\n====Drama====\nThe 2UE Dramatic Players were established in the 1930s providing a number of dramas and serials on a [[repertory theatre|repertory]] basis. The Players were led by [[George Edwards (actor)|George Edwards]], arguably the most prominent radio actor and producer of the time.  Some time later, Paul Jacklin<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacklin-paul-seymour-12687</ref> was appointed as 2UE's head of production.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/> Malcolm \"Max\" Afford<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/afford-malcolm-max-9315</ref> also played an important role in 2UE's dramatic productions in the 1930s and into the 1940s.  Right up to the early 1960s 2UE was to produce many dozens of audio plays for the Major Broadcasting Network. These mainly consisted of 15-minute serials or soap operas and 30-minute dramas. However, probably the most important dramatic production to emanate from the 2UE studios was the Australian version of the ''Lux Radio Theatre''<ref>''ABC Weekly'', various editions \u2013 http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/abchtm/pubs_abcweekly.htm</ref><ref>http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A143501;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10</ref><ref>[[Lux Radio Theatre]]</ref> which was heard at 8.00&nbsp;pm every Sunday evening until 1952 \u2013 in pre-television days, arguably the most listened-to hour in the week for any radio station. (For much of its time on air, the Lux Radio Theatre was in competition with 2GB's ''Macquarie Radio Theatre'' later known as the ''Caltex Theatre''.)<ref>https://www.google.com.au/search?source=hp&q=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&oq=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1394.15393.0.16459.29.29.0.0.0.0.260.5280.2-23.24.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..5.21.4806.0..0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1j33i160k1j33i21k1j33i22i29i30k1.250.TtJlDsQFFQI</ref><ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Live Music====\n2UE transmitted many live musical broadcasts during this era. These ranged from classical to pop. The importance of these types of programming at that time, is highlighted by the fact that in 1933 the 2UE Academy of Music was formed under Rex Shaw<ref>http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6cj8dxv</ref> and Professor Clarence Elkin, so as to train singers and instrumentalists, particularly in the classical field. However, the Academy only lasted about a year.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Cricket / Don Bradman====\nIn the 1930s, [[Test Cricket]] had a particularly high profile and most capital city radio stations, both the ABC and commercial stations, used the cricket as a vehicle for competitive programming, often interspersing live variety programs with news of the ongoing match supplied by overseas [[cablegram]]s. In 1931 a Sydney menswear store arranged for [[Don Bradman]] to broadcast twice weekly during the cricket season.  He was on a two-year contract at the very high sum of \u00a31,000 a year; a deal which is credited with keeping Bradman in Australia.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nBradman also regularly played the piano during 2UE's weekly ''Call to Youth'' program.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n===1940s===\n====Accommodation====\nIn July 1941 Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] officially opened a new 1,000 watt [[radio transmitter|transmitter]] at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]]. The transmitter tower was wired with explosives by the army, so that an enemy could not have used it, should there have been a [[World War II]] invasion.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n \nFire destroyed the Savoy House studios in 1943, and another Sydney station, [[2CH]], gave 2UE temporary accommodation in their own studio complex.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Horse Racing====\n2UE was well known over many decades for its coverage of races, both in Sydney and, through relays, of meetings throughout Australia. It also relayed Sydney races both through Major Broadcasting Network affiliates and through other stations. The 2UE racing service commenced in 1945 when Sports Editor [[Clif Cary]], already well known for his cricket broadcasts, started a service then known as the Associated Sports Broadcasts which relayed horse racing and other Saturday afternoon sporting events to nine other N.S.W. stations.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/> The racing service ended in 1983 when [[Des Hoysted]] called the last race to be broadcast by 2UE. The long list of 2UE race-callers included [[Clif Cary]], Ken Howard, Des Hoysted, Andrew Martin and Harry Solomons.\n\n===1950s===\n====Promotional slogan====\nDuring this era, 2UE was known as '''The Modern Station'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sale of 2UE====\nIn 1954 John Lamb purchased 2UE from Associated Newspapers, for \u00a3165,000 ($330,000). Lamb also owned [[2KO]] [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. John Lamb died in 1978, and his son, Stewart, moved from Newcastle to Sydney to look after the Lamb family's interests in 2UE.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lamb-john-10773</ref>\n\n====Gary O'Callaghan====\n[[Gary O'Callaghan]] was Sydney's number one breakfast announcer for 28 years, winning 159 surveys.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/2ue-radio-host-gary-ocallaghan-dead-at-83-20170819-gxzue9.html</ref><ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Top 40====\n2UE instigated Australia's first [[Top 40]] on 2 March 1958, with former Newcastle announcer Pat Barton<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/vale-pat-barton</ref> as the host of a daily Top 40 program. The number one song on the very first Top 40 chart was [[Pat Boone]]'s [[April Love (song)|April Love]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/top-40-turns-50-video-has-failed-kill-radio-star</ref>\n\n===1960s===\n====New promotional slogan====\nDuring the 1960s, the station was known as '''The Brighter 2UE'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sydney's Pop Music station====\nIn the early 1960s, 2UE dropped virtually all of its variety and drama shows. It was considered that television had become the home for these types of programming. 2UE increased its reliance on a Top 40 format, becoming one of the first stations in Australia to devote most of its air time to pop music, but by the end of this decade [[2SM]] had superseded 2UE as Sydney's most popular Top 40 station.\n\nPopular 2UE DJs in this era included [[Bob Rogers (disc jockey)|Bob Rogers]],Tony Withers and [[John Laws]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nCommencing in 1966, a major pop music promotion on 2UE Sydney and [[3UZ]] Melbourne was [[[[Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds]], a national rock band concert staged to promote Australian talent and foster new bands. However, after a few years, 2SM was appointed as the Sydney outlet for the Battle of the Sounds, replacing 2UE.<ref>http://www.milesago.com/performance/hoadleys.htm</ref>\n\nOne popular variety program that did survive for many years was the ''National Old Time Dance'' with Jack Papworth's orchestra, every Friday evening. It was relayed to stations across Australia. At one stage it was broadcast from The Albert Palais, Leichhardt.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>http://www.australianotr.com.au/allan-black-2ue-parts-1-15.html</ref>\n\n====Talkback====\nUntil 1967 talkback was illegal in Australia because of government concerns that: a) people may say something they shouldn't; and b) callers may not know they were on the air.  Nevertheless, many stations, particularly [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] in Sydney and [[3AK]] Melbourne, did broadcast talkback from 1963. However, 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)]] were the first Australian stations to legally present talkback, commencing on 17 April 1967. Journalist Ormsby Wilkins was the first 2UE talkback host.<ref>https://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/50-years-talkback-radio-australia</ref>\n\n===1970s===\n====Country Music====\nAlthough 2UE was mainly broadcasting Top 40 during this period, in the early 1970s it also featured some [[country music]], including programs hosted by Studio Manager Nick Erby. John Laws also included a deal of country music in his programs.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n====Ownership Changes====\nThe Lamb family sold 2UE to [[Kerry Packer]] in the 1980s, and Packer then sold it to [[Alan Bond]] but when the Bond Empire was crumbling in the early 1990s,the Lamb family was to buy back 2UE.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/late-stewart-lambs-contribution-radio-industry</ref>\n\n==== CBC Network ====\nIn 1986, under Kerry Packer, 2UE and [[3AK]] Melbourne, embarked on a shared [[talk-back]] format called the '''CBC Network''' which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney based programs being broadcast across both stations. Two separate breakfast programs were broadcast for both Sydney and Melbourne but that was the only shift with separate programming. All other programs, whether emanating from Sydney or Melbourne, were heard over both stations.  Well-known Sydney and Melbourne news broadcaster and radio management expert Brian White managed both stations. However, the CBC experiment was a short-lived failure.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/talk-radio-entrant-faces-a-hard-oft-travelled-road/story-e6frg99x-1225855203124 Talk radio entrant faces a hard, oft-travelled road], By Mark Day, 19 April 2010, The Australian</ref>\n\n====Huge Prize====\nIn 1984 2UE ran a competition, ''Millionaire Mania'' in which a prize of $20,000 a year for 50 years, was offered.

It concerned [[Advertorial|paid advertising]] on talk back radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. The affair was first reported on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' by reporters [[Richard Ackland]], [[Deborah Richards]] and Ann Connelly.  They revealed that 2UE hosts [[John Laws]] and [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including [[Qantas]], [[Optus]], [[Foxtel]], [[Mirvac]] and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. The [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] found that John Laws, Alan Jones, and 2UE had committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE's license conditions. 2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws's improper conduct.<ref name=\"jla\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/john-laws-ads-cost-2ue-radio-360000-20090717-dnlb.html |title=John Laws' ads cost 2UE radio $360,000 |author=Katelyn Catanzariti |accessdate=6 September 2011 |date=17 July 2009 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  }}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132016===\n====News Talk====\n2UE continued to broadcast a [[news talk]] format, involving current affairs oriented programs with [[talk radio|talkback]] across the day and more relaxed programming at nights and on weekends.

The station was to have the call-sign 2EU, based on the initials of '''E'''lectrical '''U'''tilities. However, before the licence, ''PMG - Broadcasting Station Licence'' No.12, was issued on 7 November 1924, Electrical Utilities advised the PMG that it wished to reverse the initials in the call-sign - thus the licence was issued to 2UE.<ref>copy of the original licence in the collections of Bruce Carty, [[Gosford]], [[New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n====2UE====\n2UE opened on 26 January 1925. The founder of Electrical Utilities and 2EU/2UE was Cecil \"Pa\" Stevenson, who was also 2UE's chief engineer, and one of the most prominent personalities in Australia's early broadcasting history.  Prior to opening 2UE, he had operated experimental station 2IY, as well as working alongside a couple of other early experimenters.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\">Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio History'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/son-2eu-passes</ref>\n\nThe original studio was in the dining room of Stevenson's [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]] home; and an 80 feet (24.384 metres) transmitting tower was installed in his back yard. All the equipment was homemade; the studio and equipment costing \u00a3750 ($1,500) to build, and \u00a39 ($18) per week to operate. Within a short time the studios were moved to Stevenson's radio store in [[George Street, Sydney]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nMost programming was provided by [[78 rpm]] recordings or [[player piano]] rolls. It is reputed that whilst changing records or rolls, Stevenson would whistle so as to prevent dead air.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> 2UE was originally on the air daily from 8.00&nbsp;pm to 10.00&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\">Walker, R.R., ''The Magic Spark: 50 Years of Radio in Australia'', 1973, The Hawthorn Press, Melbourne</ref> The station is reputed to have broadcast Australia's first radio advertisement.  A local butcher was so disconcerted with the sounds between recordings and piano rolls that he paid Stevenson one shilling (10\u00a2) to substitute his whistling with short talks about the quality of the butcher's meat. One shilling then became the station's standard advertising rate.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\">Griffen-Foley, Bridget, ''Changing Stations: The Story of Australian Commercial Radio'', UNSW Press, 2009, Sydney</ref>\n\nThere are records of early 2UE broadcasts being picked-up in the US and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n2UE is the oldest current commercial radio station in Australia.<ref>Carty, Bruce, ''On the Air: Australian Radio \nHistory'', privately published, 2011, Gosford, N.S.W.</ref><ref>2UE was not the first B Class or commercial station in Australia. This honour goes to either [[2CM]] or [[2BE (Sydney)|2BE]], according to one's definition of a B Class station. They both broadcast out of Sydney, and both of these stations were short-lived. Bruce Carty claims that the first B Class station was 2CM, whilst R.R. Walker plumps for 2BE. The second-oldest current commercial radio station on the air is [[2HD]] Newcastle, which made its first broadcast just one day after 2UE.</ref>\n\nIn 1929, through Cecil Stevenson, 2UE experimented with sending pictures by radio using radiovision or [[Television|mechanical television]]. The [[television in Australia|experiments]] were short-lived due to the lack of receivers to pick up\nthe transmissions.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> (Melbourne stations [[3UZ]] and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] also both conducted similar experimental transmissions in 1929.)\n\n===1930s===\n====Broadcast Services Association====\nAs a cost saving measure in the depths of the [[Great Depression]], in December 1935 it was announced that an organisation to be known as Broadcasting Service Association, Limited, would co-ordinate and provide combined production resources for 2UE and [[2GB]], but without owning or operating either station.  On 7 January 1937, it was announced that the two stations would operate as the ''Red Network'' and the ''Blue Network''; a concept which was copied from the US's [[NBC]] network, which operated a [[NBC Red Network|Red Network]] and [[NBC Blue Network|Blue Network]] at this time. However, the concept never transpired in Australia, because in February 1937 2GB announced that it was going to form its own national network, and that eventually led to the formation of the [[Macquarie Media|Macquarie Network]] in 1938<ref>see also [[The Labor Daily]] \u2013 http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/237442801</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230799639 |title=Radio Network System |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=8457 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 February 1937 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> which was at first jointly managed by 2GB and 2UE.<ref name=company>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article229134023 |title=Radio Company Formed |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=1841 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 July 1938 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n====Major Broadcasting Network====\nIn 1938 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)|3DB]] Melbourne launched the [[Major Broadcasting Network]] which for many decades was Australia's second most important radio network, after the Macquarie Network. The main person behind the formation of the Major Network was [[David Thomas Worrall|David Worrall]], manager of 3DB, and a most important figure in broadcasting history.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/worrall-david-thomas-12074</ref><ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\nThe Major Network's Sydney outlet later changed from 2UE to [[2CH]] and then to [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] before 2UE yet again became the Major Network outlet in Sydney in September 1950<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230472085 |title=Drug addict's struggle back to happiness |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=12,681 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1950 |accessdate=29 October 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\nThe Network broadcast a wide range of live variety programs including quizzes and [[radio drama|dramas]] including [[soap operas]], mostly emanating from the 3DB or 2UE studios.<ref>Jones, Colin, ''Something in the Air: A History of Radio in Australia'', Kangaroo Press, 1995.</ref>\n\nThe formation of the Major Network actually happened after two earlier attempts by David Worrall to form a network with 2UE as the Sydney station. In 1933, a loose grouping, but the first Australian attempt to form a commercial network, was attempted, known as the Federal Network. Then, in 1933 the Associated Broadcasters of Australia was formed but, again, did not last long.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/>\n\n====Accommodation====\nIn 1938 2UE and 2GB, as partners in the newly formed Broadcast Services Association moved their studios and offices to Savoy House, 29 Bligh Street, Sydney,<ref name=company/> with 2UE on the 4th and 5th floors and [[2GB]] on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\nIn 1930 a new transmitter was installed at [[Lilli Pilli, New South Wales|Lilli Pilli]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Ownership====\nIn 1933\u201334 Stevenson sold the station to Associated Newspapers Ltd, publishers of [[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]].<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Time Signal====\nIn 1938 the station was commencing its broadcasts at 6.00&nbsp;am with ''The Alarm Clock''.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nFrom 1939, 2UE became the first Australian station to broadcast six pips from the Australian [[observatory]] as an hourly [[time signal]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/> For many decades all Australian stations carried the six pip time signal first heard on 2UE, and some stations still do.\n\n====Drama====\nThe 2UE Dramatic Players were established in the 1930s providing a number of dramas and serials on a [[repertory theatre|repertory]] basis. The Players were led by [[George Edwards (actor)|George Edwards]], arguably the most prominent radio actor and producer of the time.  Some time later, Paul Jacklin<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacklin-paul-seymour-12687</ref> was appointed as 2UE's head of production.<ref name=\"Walker, R.R. 1973\"/> Malcolm \"Max\" Afford<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/afford-malcolm-max-9315</ref> also played an important role in 2UE's dramatic productions in the 1930s and into the 1940s.  Right up to the early 1960s 2UE was to produce many dozens of audio plays for the Major Broadcasting Network. These mainly consisted of 15-minute serials or soap operas and 30-minute dramas. However, probably the most important dramatic production to emanate from the 2UE studios was the Australian version of the ''Lux Radio Theatre''<ref>''ABC Weekly'', various editions \u2013 http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/abchtm/pubs_abcweekly.htm</ref><ref>http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A143501;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10</ref><ref>[[Lux Radio Theatre]]</ref> which was heard at 8.00&nbsp;pm every Sunday evening until 1952 \u2013 in pre-television days, arguably the most listened-to hour in the week for any radio station. (For much of its time on air, the Lux Radio Theatre was in competition with 2GB's ''Macquarie Radio Theatre'' later known as the ''Caltex Theatre''.)<ref>https://www.google.com.au/search?source=hp&q=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&oq=Macquarie+radio+drama+Sunday&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1394.15393.0.16459.29.29.0.0.0.0.260.5280.2-23.24.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..5.21.4806.0..0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i20i263k1j0i22i30k1j33i160k1j33i21k1j33i22i29i30k1.250.TtJlDsQFFQI</ref><ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Live Music====\n2UE transmitted many live musical broadcasts during this era. These ranged from classical to pop. The importance of these types of programming at that time, is highlighted by the fact that in 1933 the 2UE Academy of Music was formed under Rex Shaw<ref>http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6cj8dxv</ref> and Professor Clarence Elkin, so as to train singers and instrumentalists, particularly in the classical field. However, the Academy only lasted about a year.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n====Cricket / Don Bradman====\nIn the 1930s, [[Test Cricket]] had a particularly high profile and most capital city radio stations, both the ABC and commercial stations, used the cricket as a vehicle for competitive programming, often interspersing live variety programs with news of the ongoing match supplied by overseas [[cablegram]]s. In 1931 a Sydney menswear store arranged for [[Don Bradman]] to broadcast twice weekly during the cricket season.  He was on a two-year contract at the very high sum of \u00a31,000 a year; a deal which is credited with keeping Bradman in Australia.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\nBradman also regularly played the piano during 2UE's weekly ''Call to Youth'' program.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n===1940s===\n====Accommodation====\nIn July 1941 Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] officially opened a new 1,000 watt [[radio transmitter|transmitter]] at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]]. The transmitter tower was wired with explosives by the army, so that an enemy could not have used it, should there have been a [[World War II]] invasion.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n \nFire destroyed the Savoy House studios in 1943, and another Sydney station, [[2CH]], gave 2UE temporary accommodation in their own studio complex.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Horse Racing====\n2UE was well known over many decades for its coverage of races, both in Sydney and, through relays, of meetings throughout Australia. It also relayed Sydney races both through Major Broadcasting Network affiliates and through other stations. The 2UE racing service commenced in 1945 when Sports Editor [[Clif Cary]], already well known for his cricket broadcasts, started a service then known as the Associated Sports Broadcasts which relayed horse racing and other Saturday afternoon sporting events to nine other N.S.W. stations.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/> The racing service ended in 1983 when [[Des Hoysted]] called the last race to be broadcast by 2UE. The long list of 2UE race-callers included [[Clif Cary]], Ken Howard, Des Hoysted, Andrew Martin and Harry Solomons.\n\n===1950s===\n====Promotional slogan====\nDuring this era, 2UE was known as '''The Modern Station'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sale of 2UE====\nIn 1954 John Lamb purchased 2UE from Associated Newspapers, for \u00a3165,000 ($330,000). Lamb also owned [[2KO]] [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. John Lamb died in 1978, and his son, Stewart, moved from Newcastle to Sydney to look after the Lamb family's interests in 2UE.<ref>http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lamb-john-10773</ref>\n\n====Gary O'Callaghan====\n[[Gary O'Callaghan]] was Sydney's number one breakfast announcer for 28 years, winning 159 surveys.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/2ue-radio-host-gary-ocallaghan-dead-at-83-20170819-gxzue9.html</ref><ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Top 40====\n2UE instigated Australia's first [[Top 40]] on 2 March 1958, with former Newcastle announcer Pat Barton<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/vale-pat-barton</ref> as the host of a daily Top 40 program. The number one song on the very first Top 40 chart was [[Pat Boone]]'s [[April Love (song)|April Love]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/top-40-turns-50-video-has-failed-kill-radio-star</ref>\n\n===1960s===\n====New promotional slogan====\nDuring the 1960s, the station was known as '''The Brighter 2UE'''.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\n====Sydney's Pop Music station====\nIn the early 1960s, 2UE dropped virtually all of its variety and drama shows. It was considered that television had become the home for these types of programming. 2UE increased its reliance on a Top 40 format, becoming one of the first stations in Australia to devote most of its air time to pop music, but by the end of this decade [[2SM]] had superseded 2UE as Sydney's most popular Top 40 station.\n\nPopular 2UE DJs in this era included [[Bob Rogers (disc jockey)|Bob Rogers]],Tony Withers and [[John Laws]].<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/>\n\nCommencing in 1966, a major pop music promotion on 2UE Sydney and [[3UZ]] Melbourne was [[[[Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds]], a national rock band concert staged to promote Australian talent and foster new bands. However, after a few years, 2SM was appointed as the Sydney outlet for the Battle of the Sounds, replacing 2UE.<ref>http://www.milesago.com/performance/hoadleys.htm</ref>\n\nOne popular variety program that did survive for many years was the ''National Old Time Dance'' with Jack Papworth's orchestra, every Friday evening. It was relayed to stations across Australia. At one stage it was broadcast from The Albert Palais, Leichhardt.<ref name=\"Carty, Bruce 2011\"/><ref>http://www.australianotr.com.au/allan-black-2ue-parts-1-15.html</ref>\n\n====Talkback====\nUntil 1967 talkback was illegal in Australia because of government concerns that: a) people may say something they shouldn't; and b) callers may not know they were on the air.  Nevertheless, many stations, particularly [[KIIS 106.5|2UW]] in Sydney and [[3AK]] Melbourne, did broadcast talkback from 1963. However, 2UE and [[3DB (Melbourne)]] were the first Australian stations to legally present talkback, commencing on 17 April 1967. Journalist Ormsby Wilkins was the first 2UE talkback host.<ref>https://www.nfsa.gov.au/latest/50-years-talkback-radio-australia</ref>\n\n===1970s===\n====Country Music====\nAlthough 2UE was mainly broadcasting Top 40 during this period, in the early 1970s it also featured some [[country music]], including programs hosted by Studio Manager Nick Erby. John Laws also included a deal of country music in his programs.<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n====Ownership Changes====\nThe Lamb family sold 2UE to [[Kerry Packer]] in the 1980s, and Packer then sold it to [[Alan Bond]] but when the Bond Empire was crumbling in the early 1990s,the Lamb family was to buy back 2UE.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/late-stewart-lambs-contribution-radio-industry</ref>\n\n==== CBC Network ====\nIn 1986, under Kerry Packer, 2UE and [[3AK]] Melbourne, embarked on a shared [[talk-back]] format called the '''CBC Network''' which featured selected Melbourne and Sydney based programs being broadcast across both stations. Two separate breakfast programs were broadcast for both Sydney and Melbourne but that was the only shift with separate programming. All other programs, whether emanating from Sydney or Melbourne, were heard over both stations.  Well-known Sydney and Melbourne news broadcaster and radio management expert Brian White managed both stations. However, the CBC experiment was a short-lived failure.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/talk-radio-entrant-faces-a-hard-oft-travelled-road/story-e6frg99x-1225855203124 Talk radio entrant faces a hard, oft-travelled road], By Mark Day, 19 April 2010, The Australian</ref>\n\n====Huge Prize====\nIn 1984 2UE ran a competition, ''Millionaire Mania'' in which a prize of $20,000 a year for 50 years, was offered. This was believed to be the largest ever radio prize, to that date! 2UE management was no doubt relieved when Premier [[Neville Wran]] drew out the name of someone described as an \"older lady\".<ref name=\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget 2009\"/>\n\n===1990s===\n====Cash for comment====\n{{main|Cash for comment affair}}\n2UE was the centre of the cash for comment affair, an Australian scandal that broke in 1999. It concerned [[Advertorial|paid advertising]] on talk back radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. The affair was first reported on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' by reporters [[Richard Ackland]], [[Deborah Richards]] and Ann Connelly.  They revealed that 2UE hosts [[John Laws]] and [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] had been paid to give favourable comment to companies including [[Qantas]], [[Optus]], [[Foxtel]], [[Mirvac]] and major Australian banks, without disclosing this arrangement to listeners. The [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] found that John Laws, Alan Jones, and 2UE had committed 90 breaches of the industry code and five breaches of 2UE's license conditions. 2UE was fined $360,000 for John Laws's improper conduct.<ref name=\"jla\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/john-laws-ads-cost-2ue-radio-360000-20090717-dnlb.html |title=John Laws' ads cost 2UE radio $360,000 |author=Katelyn Catanzariti |accessdate=6 September 2011 |date=17 July 2009 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  }}</ref>\n\n===2010\u20132016===\n====News Talk====\n2UE continued to broadcast a [[news talk]] format, involving current affairs oriented programs with [[talk radio|talkback]] across the day and more relaxed programming at nights and on weekends. News updates were broadcast at the top of every hour, provided by [[Macquarie Radio Network]].\n\n====More Ownership Changes====\nIn March 2001, the Lamb family sold 2UE and 4BC to [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] for a reputed $90&nbsp;million.\n\nIn July 2007, [[Fairfax Media]] purchased all of Southern Cross Broadcasting's metro radio assets, including 2UE, [[3AW]] and 4BC.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-03/fairfax-buys-southern-cross-radio-stations/88360</ref>\n\nOn 22 December 2014, it was announced that Fairfax's radio division and [[Macquarie Media|Macquarie Radio Network]] would merge.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/fairfax-and-macquarie-radio-network-merge</ref> The merger was finalised on 1 April 2015.<ref>https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/mrn-fairfax-merger-complete</ref>\n\nDespite having had a strong relationship in the 1930s through the Broadcast Services Association, by the 21st century 2UE had been a constant rival of [[2GB]] for many decades.  Both of these Sydney stations had offered a similar format. In the early 2010s 2UE slipped badly in the ratings,<ref name=\"Ratings\" /> suffering major blows when long time breakfast program host [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] moved across to the 2GB breakfast program and when broadcaster [[John Laws]] retired from radio, leaving his 2UE morning program at the end of 2007.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, with 2UE and 2GB now both owned by the newly merged Macquarie Radio Network, the 2UE newsroom was closed after 90 years with the last news report being broadcast at 6&nbsp;pm that day. The news teams of both stations were merged with \"significant job cuts.\"<ref name=aust-no-news>{{cite news |last1=Sinclair|first1=Lara |title=2UE News to go off air as newsroom merges with 2GB |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/ue-news-to-go-off-air-as-newsroom-merges-with-2gb/story-e6frg996-1227297386479 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |work=The Australian |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=9 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=fairfax-merge-macq>{{cite press release |title=COMPLETION OF FAIRFAX RADIO NETWORK MERGER WITH MACQUARIE RADIO NETWORK |url=http://www.fairfaxmedia.com.au/pressroom/au---nz-press-room/au---nz-press-room/completion-of-fairfax-radio-network-merger-with-macquarie-radio-network  |accessdate=11 April 2015 |date=31 March 2015 |quote=Fairfax Media Limited ... today announced the completion of the merger of its Fairfax Radio Network ... with Macquarie Radio Network ...}}</ref>\n\n====Station ratings and market position====\nIn the eighth and final ratings survey for 2013, released on 10 December 2013, overall 2UE scored a 4.2% market share well behind market leader [[2GB]] on 13.3 which was ahead of next placed [[ABC702]] on 10.4. This rating placed 2UE tenth out of the 14 surveyed stations. During this survey period, its Monday to Friday share slipped to 3.2 per cent of the available audience, putting it behind [[Macquarie Radio Network]]'s [[2CH]] which averaged 4.6 per cent and meant 2UE was only ahead of three stations. The 2UE drive show slipping a further 0.7 points after the firing of Jason Morrison in the middle of the survey, and evenings slipping further losing 2.6 points, its biggest drop in the survey.<ref name=\"Ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://radiotoday.com.au/media/images/Syd0813.jpg |title=Sydney Radio Survey No. 8 2013 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=10 December 2013 |website=Radio Today |publisher=Radio Today |accessdate=26 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Cricket====\nOn 1 November 2013, 2UE's parent company, Fairfax Radio Network (FRN), announced that it had signed a five-year contract commencing with the 2013/2014 Australian cricket season, to broadcast the Boxing Day and Sydney Test matches, all One Day Internationals, the Big Bash League (BBL) and International T20 matches on network stations including 2UE.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.
