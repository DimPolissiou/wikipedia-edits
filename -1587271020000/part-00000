''Friends'' rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series's regular timeslot. The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired.

For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] source, to use the entire [[16:9]] widescreen frame. However, because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast. In early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition 480i videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster; the original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release.<ref>{{cite news |author=Albiniak, Paige |title=With Friends Like These, Who Needs Standard-Def? |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/481325-With_Friends_Like_These_Who_Needs_Standard_Def_.php |date=March 5, 2012 |work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226235238/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/481325-With_Friends_Like_These_Who_Needs_Standard_Def_.php |archivedate=February 26, 2013 |df= }}</ref> These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011 and the earlier HD prints continue to air on [[Comedy Central (British TV channel)|Comedy Central]] in the UK as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenscribe.tv/channels/the-one-with-the-high-definition/ |title=The One With the High Definition |publisher=ScreenScribe |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726115618/http://www.screenscribe.tv/channels/the-one-with-the-high-definition/ |archivedate=July 26, 2013 |df= }}</ref> [[Netflix]] added all ten seasons of ''Friends'' in high definition to their streaming service in the United States on January 1, 2015.\n\n==Home media==\n===Streaming===\nIn October 2014, [[Warner Bros.]] chairman and chief executive officer, [[Kevin Tsujihara]], announced that the company had licensed the [[North America]]n streaming rights of all ten seasons of ''Friends'' to [[Netflix]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/friends-netflix-streaming-deal-851909/|title='Friends' Licensed To Netflix In Warner Bros Deal \u2014 VIDEO|last=Lieberman|first=David|date=October 15, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=December 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101944/https://deadline.com/2014/10/friends-netflix-streaming-deal-851909/|archive-date=December 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Friends-Netflix-Video-Gunther-1088084.aspx|title=Friends Is Coming to Netflix!|last1=Raftery|first1=Liz|date=October 15, 2014|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018011929/http://www.tvguide.com/News/Friends-Netflix-Video-Gunther-1088084.aspx|archivedate=October 18, 2014|url-status=live|publisher=tvguide.com|agency=[[CBS Interactive]]|df=}}</ref> in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/seinfeld-vs-friends-streaming|title=Seinfeld vs. Friends: Breaking Down the Economics of Two Beloved '90s Sitcoms|last=Heyman|first=Jessie|date=May 1, 2015|website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|access-date=December 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101701/https://www.vogue.com/article/seinfeld-vs-friends-streaming|archive-date=December 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> or about $120&nbsp;million in total.

''Friends'' rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series's regular timeslot. The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired.

For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] source, to use the entire [[16:9]] widescreen frame. However, because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast. In early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition 480i videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster; the original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release.<ref>{{cite news |author=Albiniak, Paige |title=With Friends Like These, Who Needs Standard-Def? |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/481325-With_Friends_Like_These_Who_Needs_Standard_Def_.php |date=March 5, 2012 |work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]] |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226235238/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/481325-With_Friends_Like_These_Who_Needs_Standard_Def_.php |archivedate=February 26, 2013 |df= }}</ref> These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011 and the earlier HD prints continue to air on [[Comedy Central (British TV channel)|Comedy Central]] in the UK as of 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenscribe.tv/channels/the-one-with-the-high-definition/ |title=The One With the High Definition |publisher=ScreenScribe |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726115618/http://www.screenscribe.tv/channels/the-one-with-the-high-definition/ |archivedate=July 26, 2013 |df= }}</ref> [[Netflix]] added all ten seasons of ''Friends'' in high definition to their streaming service in the United States on January 1, 2015.\n\n==Home media==\n===Streaming===\nIn October 2014, [[Warner Bros.]] chairman and chief executive officer, [[Kevin Tsujihara]], announced that the company had licensed the [[North America]]n streaming rights of all ten seasons of ''Friends'' to [[Netflix]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/friends-netflix-streaming-deal-851909/|title='Friends' Licensed To Netflix In Warner Bros Deal \u2014 VIDEO|last=Lieberman|first=David|date=October 15, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=December 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101944/https://deadline.com/2014/10/friends-netflix-streaming-deal-851909/|archive-date=December 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Friends-Netflix-Video-Gunther-1088084.aspx|title=Friends Is Coming to Netflix!|last1=Raftery|first1=Liz|date=October 15, 2014|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=October 15, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018011929/http://www.tvguide.com/News/Friends-Netflix-Video-Gunther-1088084.aspx|archivedate=October 18, 2014|url-status=live|publisher=tvguide.com|agency=[[CBS Interactive]]|df=}}</ref> in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/seinfeld-vs-friends-streaming|title=Seinfeld vs. Friends: Breaking Down the Economics of Two Beloved '90s Sitcoms|last=Heyman|first=Jessie|date=May 1, 2015|website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|access-date=December 24, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224101701/https://www.vogue.com/article/seinfeld-vs-friends-streaming|archive-date=December 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> or about $120&nbsp;million in total.

The objective of the conquests was mostly of a practical nature, as fertile land and water were scarce in the Arabian peninsula. A real Islamization therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.<ref name=\"Hourani 1\">Hourani, pg.22-24</ref>\n\n[[Ira Lapidus]] distinguishes between two separate strands of converts of the time: one is animists and polytheists of tribal societies of the Arabian peninsula and the [[Fertile crescent]]; the other one is the native Christians and Jews who existed peacefully before the Muslim invaders arrived.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\">Lapidus, 200-201</ref>\n\nThe empire spread from the Atlantic Ocean to the [[Aral Sea]], from the [[Atlas Mountains]] to the [[Hindu Kush]], bounded mostly \"a combination of natural barriers and well-organized states\".<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> \n\nFor the polytheistic and pagan societies, apart from the religious and spiritual reasons each individual may have had, conversion to Islam \"represented the response of a tribal, pastoral population to the need for a larger framework for political and economic integration, a more stable state, and a more imaginative and encompassing moral vision to cope with the problems of a tumultuous society.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> In contrast, for tribal, nomadic, monotheistic societies, \"Islam was substituted for a Byzantine or Sassanian political identity and for a Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian religious affiliation.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> Conversion initially was neither required nor necessarily wished for: \"(The Arab conquerors) did not require the conversion as much as the subordination of non-Muslim peoples. At the outset, they were hostile to conversions because new Muslims diluted the economic and status advantages of the Arabs.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nOnly in subsequent centuries, with the development of the religious doctrine of Islam and with that the understanding of the Muslim [[ummah]], did mass conversion take place. The new understanding by the religious and political leadership in many cases led to a weakening or breakdown of the social and religious structures of parallel religious communities such as Christians and Jews.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nThe caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies. They furthermore began the ambitious project of building mosques across the empire, many of which remain today as the most magnificent Mosques in the Islamic world, such as the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At the end of the Umayyad period, less than 10% of the people in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Spain were Muslim. Only on the Arabian peninsula was the proportion of Muslims among the population higher than this.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\">Hourani, pg.41-48</ref>\n\n===Phase II: The Abbasids (750\u20131258)===\n{{see also|Abbasid Caliphate}}\n[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s are known to have founded some of the world's earliest educational institutions such as the [[House of Wisdom]].]]\n\nThe Abbasid era replaced the expanding empire and \"tribal politics\" of \"the tight-knit Syro-Arabian elite<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> with cosmopolitan culture and disciplines of Islamic [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]],<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> [[islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic theology|theology]], [[Islamic Law|law]] and [[Islamic mysticism|mysticism]] became more widespread and the gradual conversions of the populations within the empire occurred. Significant conversions also occurred beyond the extents of the empire such as that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] in [[Central Asia]] and peoples living in regions south of the [[Sahara]] in [[Africa]] through contact with Muslim traders active in the area and [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]]. In Africa it spread along three routes, across the Sahara via trading towns such as [[Timbuktu]], up the [[Nile Valley]] through [[the Sudan]] up to [[Uganda]] and across the [[Red Sea]] and down [[East Africa]] through settlements such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. These initial conversions were of a flexible nature.\n\nThe reasons why, by the end of the 10th century, a large part of the population had converted to Islam are diverse. According to British-Lebanese historian [[Albert Hourani]], one of the reasons may be that\n<blockquote>  \t \n\"Islam had become more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non-Muslims more sharply drawn. Muslims now lived within an elaborated system of ritual, doctrine and law clearly different from those of non-Muslims. (...) The status of Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians was more precisely defined, and in some ways it was inferior. They were regarded as the 'People of the Book', those who possessed a revealed scripture, or 'People of the Covenant', with whom compacts of protection had been made. In general they were not forced to convert, but they suffered from restrictions. They paid a special tax; they were not supposed to wear certain colors; they could not marry Muslim women;.\"<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\t \n</blockquote>\n\nMost of these laws were elaborations of basic laws concerning non-Muslims (''[[dhimmi]]s'') in the [[Quran]]. The Quran does not give much detail about the right conduct with non-Muslims, in principle recognizing the religion of \"People of the book\" (Jews, Christians, and sometimes others as well) and securing a separate tax from them in lieu of the [[zakat]] imposed upon Muslim subjects.\n\n[[Ira M. Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] points towards \"interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion\" as appealing to the masses.<ref name=\":0\">Lapidus, 271.</ref> He writes that :\n\n<blockquote>\"The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe result of this, he points out, can be seen in the diversity of Muslim societies today, with varying manifestations and practices of Islam.\n\nConversion to Islam also came about as a result of the breakdown of historically religiously organized societies: with the weakening of many churches, for example, and the favoring of Islam and the migration of substantial Muslim Turkish populations into the areas of Anatolia and the Balkans, the \"social and cultural relevance of Islam\" were enhanced and a large number of peoples were converted. This worked better in some areas (Anatolia) and less in others (e.g. the Balkans, where \"the spread of Islam was limited by the vitality of the Christian churches.\")<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nAlong with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged by the end of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Hourani 11\">Hourani, pg.54</ref> Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, and Sunnis and Shiites, and unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: Umayyad Period vs. Abbasid Period====\nThere are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as responsible for setting up the \"dhimmah\"  to increase taxes from the ''[[dhimmi]]s'' to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and to discourage conversion.<ref name=\"Astren\">Fred Astren pg.33-35</ref> Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arabs and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''[[mawali]]''.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues from the tax on non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the following [[Abbasid]] period an enfranchisement was experienced by the ''mawali'' and a shift was made in the political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire<ref name=\"Tobin\">Tobin 113-115</ref> and c. 930 a law was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire to be Muslims.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] into the new territories.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: \"Conversion curve\"====\n[[Richard Bulliet]]'s \"conversion curve\" shows a relatively low rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric [[Umayyad]] period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural [[Abbasid]] period which saw the Muslim population grow from approx. 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> This theory does not explain the continuing existence of large minorities of Christians in the Abbasid Period. Other estimates suggest that Muslims were not a majority in Egypt until the mid-10th century and in the Fertile Crescent until 1100. Syria may have had a Christian majority within its modern borders until the Mongol Invasions of the 13th century.\n====Growth rate====\nIn addition to conversion to Islam, the Muslim population also grew from a higher birth rate than non-Muslims, a result of the right of Muslim men to marry four women, and possess numerous concubines and having the power to ensure their children were raised Muslims.<ref name=RGHIGP2015:229>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.229</ref> \n\n===Phase III: Western Europe and the emergence of the Seljuks and Ottomans (950-1450)===\n{{see also|History of Islam in southern Italy}}\nThe expansion of Islam continued in the wake of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] conquests of [[Asia Minor]], the [[Balkans]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/> The earlier period also saw the acceleration in the rate of conversions in the Muslim heartland while in the wake of the conquests the newly conquered regions retained significant non-Muslim populations in contrast to the regions where the boundaries of the Muslim world contracted, such as the [[Emirate of Sicily]] ([[Italy]]) and [[Al Andalus]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]), where Muslim populations were expelled or forced to [[Christianization|Christianize]] in short order.<ref name=\"Goddard\"/> The latter period of this phase was marked by the [[Mongol invasion]] (particularly the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258) and after an initial period of persecution, the conversion of these conquerors to Islam.\n\n===Phase IV: Ottoman Empire: 1299 - 1924===\n{{see also|Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Central europe 1683.png|thumb|200px|Territories in Central Europe under the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1683 CE.]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] defended its frontiers initially against threats from several sides: the [[Safavids]] on the Eastern side, the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the North which vanished with the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, and the great Catholic powers from the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice with its eastern Mediterranean colonies.\n\nLater, the Ottoman Empire set on to conquer territories from these rivals: Cyprus and other Greek islands (except Crete) were lost by Venice to the Ottomans, and the latter conquered territory up to the Danube basin as far as Hungary. Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699.<ref name=\"Hourani 5\">Hourani, pg.221,222</ref>\n\n===Phase V: Post-Ottoman Empire to the present===\n{{further|Islamization#Modern day (1970s to present)}}\nIslam has continued to spread through commerce and migrations; especially in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/>\n\n== By region ==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|350px|thumb|right|Age of the [[Caliph]]s {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632/A.H. 1-11}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]], 632\u2013661/A.H. 11-40}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]], 661\u2013750/A.H. 40-129}}]]\n\n===Arabia===\n{{further|Early social changes under Islam}}\nAt [[Mecca]], [[Muhammad]] is said to have received repeated embassies from Christian tribes.\n\n===Greater Syria===\n{{main|Muslim conquest of the Levant}}\nLike their Byzantine and late Sasanian predecessors, the [[Marwanid]] caliphs nominally ruled the various religious communities but allowed the communities' own appointed or elected officials to administer most internal affairs. Yet the Marwanids also depended heavily on the help of non-Arab administrative personnel and on administrative practices (e.g., a set of government bureaus). As the conquests slowed and the isolation of the fighters (''muqatilah'') became less necessary, it became more and more difficult to keep Arabs garrisoned. As the tribal links that had so dominated Umayyad politics began to break down, the meaningfulness of tying non-Arab converts to Arab tribes as clients was diluted; moreover, the number of non-Muslims who wished to join the ummah was already becoming too large for this process to work effectively.\n\n===Palestine===\n{{further|Islamization of Jerusalem}}\n[[File:Temple Mount.JPG|thumb]]\n\nThe Great Muslim army siege Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636 CE. For four months, the siege continued. Ultimately, the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], an ethnic Arab,<ref>Donald E. Wagner. ''Dying in the Land of Promise: Palestine and Palestinian Christianity from Pentecost to 2000''</ref> agreed to surrender Jerusalem to [[caliph Omar]] in person. The caliph, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and travelled to [[Jerusalem]] to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Omar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or [[Umar's Assurance|Covenant of Omar]], allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for \"[[jizya]]\", a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called \"[[dhimmis]]\". Under Muslim Rule, the Jewish and Christian population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |year=1910 |title=Jerusalem}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Jew in the Medieval World: A Source Book, 315-1791 |last=Marcus |first=Jacob Rader |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |date=March 2000 |isbn=0-87820-217-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 13\u201315] |edition=Revised |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 }}</ref>\n\nHaving accepted the surrender, Omar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius \"and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities\".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], ci, ed. Bury, London, 1898, V, 436</ref> When the hour for his prayer came, Omar was in the Anastasis church, but refused to pray there, lest in the future Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The [[Mosque of Omar]], opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.\n\nBishop [[Arculf]], whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, [[De Locis Sanctis]], written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule. The caliphs of Damascus (661-750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. St. John Damascene) held important offices at their court. The Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad (753-1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant to Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar (786-809), sent the keys of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\" />\n\nRival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. In the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the Shia Fatimid dynasty of North Africa. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Greeks continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Byzantines were put to death for high treason by the ruling shiite Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonous correspondence with the Byzantines. As Jerusalem grew in importance to Muslims and pilgrimages increased, tolerance for other religions declined. Christians were persecuted and churches destroyed.

Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had then all adopted [[Islam]], and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]] came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]]. Through commerce, Islam spread amongst the Somali population in the coastal cities. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard.

From there Arab trade routes into the interior of Africa helped the slow acceptance of Islam.\n\nBy the 10th century, the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] was founded by [[Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi]] (was one of seven sons of a ruler of [[Shiraz]], Persia, his mother an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] slave girl.

His successors would rule the most powerful of [[Sultanate]]s in the [[Swahili coast]], during the peak of its expansion the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] stretched from [[Inhambane]] in the south to [[Malindi]] in the north.

It is one of the finest examples of [[Islamic architecture]] in the [[Umayyad]] style; inspired the design of other Mosques in [[Al-Andalus]].]]\nThe history of Arab and Islamic rule in the Iberian peninsula is probably one of the most studied periods of European history. For centuries after the Arab conquest, European accounts of Arab rule in Iberia were negative. European points of view started changing with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which resulted in new descriptions of the period of Islamic rule in Spain as a \"golden age\" (mostly as a reaction against Spain's militant Roman Catholicism after 1500){{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.\n\nThe tide of Arab expansion after 630 rolled through North Africa up to Ceuta in present-day Morocco. Their arrival coincided with a period of political weakness in the three centuries old kingdom established in the Iberian peninsula by the Germanic [[Visigoths]], who had taken over the region after seven centuries of Roman rule. Seizing the opportunity, an Arab-led (but mostly Berber) army invaded in 711, and by 720 had conquered the southern and central regions of the peninsula. The Arab expansion pushed over the mountains into southern [[France]], and for a short period Arabs controlled the old Visigothic province of Septimania (centered on present-day Narbonne). The Arab Caliphate was pushed back by [[Charles Martel]] (King of the Franks or French) at Poitiers, and Christian armies started pushing southwards over the mountains, until [[Charlemagne]] established in 801 the Spanish March (which stretched from Barcelona to present day Navarre).\n\nA major development in the history of Muslim Spain was the dynastic change in 750 in the Arab Caliphate, when an Umayyad Prince escaped the slaughter of his family in Damascus, fled to Cordoba in Spain, and created a new Islamic state in the area. This was the start of a distinctly Spanish Muslim society, where large Christian and Jewish populations coexisted with an increasing percentage of Muslims. There are many stories of descendants of Visigothic chieftains and Roman counts whose families converted to Islam during this period. The at-first small Muslim elite continued to grow with converts, and with a few exceptions, rulers in Islamic Spain allowed Christians and Jews the right specified in the Koran to practice their own religions, though non-Muslims suffered from political and taxation inequities. The net result was, in those areas of Spain where Muslim rule lasted the longest, the creation of a society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants, a process in some ways similar to the assimilation many years later of millions of immigrants to the United States into English-speaking culture.  As the descendants of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans concentrated in the north of the peninsula, in the kingdoms of Asturias/Leon, Navarre and Aragon and started a long campaign known as the 'Reconquista' which started with the victory of the Christian armies in [[Covadonga]] in 722.  Military campaigns continued without pause.  In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castille took back Toledo.  In 1212 the crucial [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] meant the recovery of the bulk of the peninsula for the Christian kingdoms.  In 1238 James I of Aragon  took Valencia.  In 1236 the ancient Roman city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] was re-conquered by Ferdinand III of Castille and in 1248 the city of [[Seville]].  The famous medieval epic poem '[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]' narrates the life and deeds of this hero during the [[Reconquista]].\n\nThe Islamic state centered in Cordoba had ended up splintering into many smaller kingdoms (the so-called taifas). While Muslim Spain was fragmenting, the Christian kingdoms grew larger and stronger, and the balance of power shifted against the 'Taifa' kingdoms. The last Muslim kingdom of Granada in the south was finally taken in 1492 by Queen Isabelle of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1499, the remaining Muslim inhabitants were ordered to convert or leave (at the same time the Jews were expelled). Poorer Muslims ([[Moriscos]]) who could not afford to leave ended up converting to Catholic Christianity and hiding their Muslim practices, hiding from the Spanish Inquisition, until their presence was finally extinguished.\n\n====Balkans====\n{{see also|Rumelia|Balkans|Ottoman Empire}}\nIn Balkan history, historical writing on the topic of conversion to Islam was, and still is, a highly charged political issue. It is intrinsically linked to the issues of formation of national identities and rival territorial claims of the Balkan states. The generally accepted nationalist discourse of the current Balkan historiography defines all forms of Islamization as results of the Ottoman government's centrally organized policy of conversion or ''[[dawah]]''. The truth is that Islamization in each Balkan country took place in the course of many centuries, and its nature and phase was determined not by the Ottoman government but by the specific conditions of each locality. Ottoman conquests were initially military and economic enterprises, and religious conversions were not their primary objective. True, the statements surrounding victories all celebrated the incorporation of territory into Muslim domains, but the actual Ottoman focus was on taxation and making the realms productive, and a religious campaign would have disrupted that economic objective.\n\nOttoman Islamic standards of toleration allowed for autonomous \"nations\" (''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'') in the Empire, under their own personal law and under the rule of their own religious leaders. As a result, vast areas of the Balkans remained mostly Christian during the period of Ottoman domination. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches had a higher position in the Ottoman Empire, mainly because the Patriarch resided in Istanbul and was an officer of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast, Roman Catholics, while tolerated, were suspected of loyalty to a foreign power (the Papacy). It is no surprise that the Roman Catholic areas of Bosnia, Kosovo and northern Albania, ended up with more substantial conversions to Islam. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1699 by the Austrians resulted in their loss of Hungary and present-day Croatia. The remaining Muslim converts in both elected to leave \"lands of unbelief\" and moved to territory still under the Ottomans. Around this point in time, new European ideas of romantic nationalism started to seep into the Empire, and provided the intellectual foundation for new nationalistic ideologies and the reinforcement of the self-image of many Christian groups as subjugated peoples.\n\nAs a rule, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] did not require followers of Greek Orthodoxy to become [[Muslim]]s, although many did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1387&Itemid=90|title=PontosWorld|publisher=}}</ref> \nOne by one, the Balkan nationalities asserted their independence from the Empire, and frequently the presence of members of the same ethnicity who had converted to Islam presented a problem from the point of view of the now dominant new national ideology, which narrowly defined the nation as members of the local dominant Orthodox Christian denomination.<ref name=\"Blumi32\"/> Some Muslims in the Balkans chose to leave, while [[Persecution of Muslims|many others were forcefully expelled]] to what was left of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Blumi32\">{{cite book|last=Blumi|first=Isa|title=Reinstating the Ottomans, Alternative Balkan Modernities: 1800\u20131912|year=2011|location=New York  |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ca3IAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Reinstating+the+Ottomans,+Alternative+Balkan+Modernities:+1800-1912&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20expulsion%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9CTurks%E2%80%9D%20(i.e.%2C%20Muslims)&f=false|isbn=9780230119086|pages=32|ref=harv}}</ref>  This demographic transition can be illustrated by the decrease in the number of mosques in [[Belgrade]], from over 70 in 1750 (before Serbian independence in 1815), to only three in 1850.\n\n====Immigration====\nSince the 1960s, many Muslims have migrated to Western Europe.

The objective of the conquests was mostly of a practical nature, as fertile land and water were scarce in the Arabian peninsula. A real Islamization therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.<ref name=\"Hourani 1\">Hourani, pg.22-24</ref>\n\n[[Ira Lapidus]] distinguishes between two separate strands of converts of the time: one is animists and polytheists of tribal societies of the Arabian peninsula and the [[Fertile crescent]]; the other one is the native Christians and Jews who existed peacefully before the Muslim invaders arrived.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\">Lapidus, 200-201</ref>\n\nThe empire spread from the Atlantic Ocean to the [[Aral Sea]], from the [[Atlas Mountains]] to the [[Hindu Kush]], bounded mostly \"a combination of natural barriers and well-organized states\".<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> \n\nFor the polytheistic and pagan societies, apart from the religious and spiritual reasons each individual may have had, conversion to Islam \"represented the response of a tribal, pastoral population to the need for a larger framework for political and economic integration, a more stable state, and a more imaginative and encompassing moral vision to cope with the problems of a tumultuous society.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> In contrast, for tribal, nomadic, monotheistic societies, \"Islam was substituted for a Byzantine or Sassanian political identity and for a Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian religious affiliation.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/> Conversion initially was neither required nor necessarily wished for: \"(The Arab conquerors) did not require the conversion as much as the subordination of non-Muslim peoples. At the outset, they were hostile to conversions because new Muslims diluted the economic and status advantages of the Arabs.\"<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nOnly in subsequent centuries, with the development of the religious doctrine of Islam and with that the understanding of the Muslim [[ummah]], did mass conversion take place. The new understanding by the religious and political leadership in many cases led to a weakening or breakdown of the social and religious structures of parallel religious communities such as Christians and Jews.<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nThe caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies. They furthermore began the ambitious project of building mosques across the empire, many of which remain today as the most magnificent Mosques in the Islamic world, such as the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At the end of the Umayyad period, less than 10% of the people in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Spain were Muslim. Only on the Arabian peninsula was the proportion of Muslims among the population higher than this.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\">Hourani, pg.41-48</ref>\n\n===Phase II: The Abbasids (750\u20131258)===\n{{see also|Abbasid Caliphate}}\n[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s are known to have founded some of the world's earliest educational institutions such as the [[House of Wisdom]].]]\n\nThe Abbasid era replaced the expanding empire and \"tribal politics\" of \"the tight-knit Syro-Arabian elite<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> with cosmopolitan culture and disciplines of Islamic [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]],<ref name=RGHIGP2015:207>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.207</ref> [[islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic theology|theology]], [[Islamic Law|law]] and [[Islamic mysticism|mysticism]] became more widespread and the gradual conversions of the populations within the empire occurred. Significant conversions also occurred beyond the extents of the empire such as that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] in [[Central Asia]] and peoples living in regions south of the [[Sahara]] in [[Africa]] through contact with Muslim traders active in the area and [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]]. In Africa it spread along three routes, across the Sahara via trading towns such as [[Timbuktu]], up the [[Nile Valley]] through [[the Sudan]] up to [[Uganda]] and across the [[Red Sea]] and down [[East Africa]] through settlements such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. These initial conversions were of a flexible nature.\n\nThe reasons why, by the end of the 10th century, a large part of the population had converted to Islam are diverse. According to British-Lebanese historian [[Albert Hourani]], one of the reasons may be that\n<blockquote>  \t \n\"Islam had become more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non-Muslims more sharply drawn. Muslims now lived within an elaborated system of ritual, doctrine and law clearly different from those of non-Muslims. (...) The status of Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians was more precisely defined, and in some ways it was inferior. They were regarded as the 'People of the Book', those who possessed a revealed scripture, or 'People of the Covenant', with whom compacts of protection had been made. In general they were not forced to convert, but they suffered from restrictions. They paid a special tax; they were not supposed to wear certain colors; they could not marry Muslim women;.\"<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\t \n</blockquote>\n\nMost of these laws were elaborations of basic laws concerning non-Muslims (''[[dhimmi]]s'') in the [[Quran]]. The Quran does not give much detail about the right conduct with non-Muslims, in principle recognizing the religion of \"People of the book\" (Jews, Christians, and sometimes others as well) and securing a separate tax from them inlieu of the [[zakat]] imposed upon Muslim subjects.\n\n[[Ira M. Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] points towards \"interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion\" as appealing to the masses.<ref name=\":0\">Lapidus, 271.</ref> He writes that :\n\n<blockquote>\"The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe result of this, he points out, can be seen in the diversity of Muslim societies today, with varying manifestations and practices of Islam.\n\nConversion to Islam also came about as a result of the breakdown of historically religiously organized societies: with the weakening of many churches, for example, and the favoring of Islam and the migration of substantial Muslim Turkish populations into the areas of Anatolia and the Balkans, the \"social and cultural relevance of Islam\" were enhanced and a large number of peoples were converted. This worked better in some areas (Anatolia) and less in others (e.g. the Balkans, where \"the spread of Islam was limited by the vitality of the Christian churches.\")<ref name=\"Lapidus 4\"/>\n\nAlong with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged by the end of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Hourani 11\">Hourani, pg.54</ref> Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, and Sunnis and Shiites, and unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.<ref name=\"Hourani 2\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: Umayyad Period vs. Abbasid Period====\nThere are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as responsible for setting up the \"dhimmah\"  to increase taxes from the ''[[dhimmi]]s'' to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and to discourage conversion.<ref name=\"Astren\">Fred Astren pg.33-35</ref> Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arabs and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''[[mawali]]''.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues from the tax on non-Muslims.\n\nDuring the following [[Abbasid]] period an enfranchisement was experienced by the ''mawali'' and a shift was made in the political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire<ref name=\"Tobin\">Tobin 113-115</ref> and c. 930 a law was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire to be Muslims.<ref name=\"Astren\"/> Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] into the new territories.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/>\n\n====Conversion within the Empire: \"Conversion curve\"====\n[[Richard Bulliet]]'s \"conversion curve\" shows a relatively low rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric [[Umayyad]] period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural [[Abbasid]] period which saw the Muslim population grow from approx. 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.<ref name=\"Tobin\"/> This theory does not explain the continuing existence of large minorities of Christians in the Abbasid Period. Other estimates suggest that Muslims were not a majority in Egypt until the mid-10th century and in the Fertile Crescent until 1100. Syria may have had a Christian majority within its modern borders until the Mongol Invasions of the 13th century.\n====Growth rate====\nIn addition to conversion to Islam, the Muslim population also grew from a higher birth rate than non-Muslims, a result of the right of Muslim men to marry four women, and possess numerous concubines and having the power to ensure their children were raised Muslims.<ref name=RGHIGP2015:229>[[#RGHIGP2015|Hoyland, ''In God's Path'', 2015]]: p.229</ref> \n\n===Phase III: Western Europe and the emergence of the Seljuks and Ottomans (950-1450)===\n{{see also|History of Islam in southern Italy}}\nThe expansion of Islam continued in the wake of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] conquests of [[Asia Minor]], the [[Balkans]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/> The earlier period also saw the acceleration in the rate of conversions in the Muslim heartland while in the wake of the conquests the newly conquered regions retained significant non-Muslim populations in contrast to the regions where the boundaries of the Muslim world contracted, such as the [[Emirate of Sicily]] ([[Italy]]) and [[Al Andalus]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]), where Muslim populations were expelled or forced to [[Christianization|Christianize]] in short order.<ref name=\"Goddard\"/> The latter period of this phase was marked by the [[Mongol invasion]] (particularly the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258) and after an initial period of persecution, the conversion of these conquerors to Islam.\n\n===Phase IV: Ottoman Empire: 1299 - 1924===\n{{see also|Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Central europe 1683.png|thumb|200px|Territories in Central Europe under the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1683 CE.]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] defended its frontiers initially against threats from several sides: the [[Safavids]] on the Eastern side, the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the North which vanished with the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, and the great Catholic powers from the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice with its eastern Mediterranean colonies.\n\nLater, the Ottoman Empire set on to conquer territories from these rivals: Cyprus and other Greek islands (except Crete) were lost by Venice to the Ottomans, and the latter conquered territory up to the Danube basin as far as Hungary. Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699.<ref name=\"Hourani 5\">Hourani, pg.221,222</ref>\n\n===Phase V: Post-Ottoman Empire to the present===\n{{further|Islamization#Modern day (1970s to present)}}\nIslam has continued to spread through commerce and migrations; especially in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Goddard\"/>\n\n== By region ==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|350px|thumb|right|Age of the [[Caliph]]s {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632/A.H. 1-11}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]], 632\u2013661/A.H. 11-40}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]], 661\u2013750/A.H. 40-129}}]]\n\n===Arabia===\n{{further|Early social changes under Islam}}\nAt [[Mecca]], [[Muhammad]] is said to have received repeated embassies from Christian tribes.\n\n===Greater Syria===\n{{main|Muslim conquest of the Levant}}\nLike their Byzantine and late Sasanian predecessors, the [[Marwanid]] caliphs nominally ruled the various religious communities but allowed the communities' own appointed or elected officials to administer most internal affairs. Yet the Marwanids also depended heavily on the help of non-Arab administrative personnel and on administrative practices (e.g., a set of government bureaus). As the conquests slowed and the isolation of the fighters (''muqatilah'') became less necessary, it became more and more difficult to keep Arabs garrisoned. As the tribal links that had so dominated Umayyad politics began to break down, the meaningfulness of tying non-Arab converts to Arab tribes as clients was diluted; moreover, the number of non-Muslims who wished to join the ummah was already becoming too large for this process to work effectively.\n\n===Palestine===\n{{further|Islamization of Jerusalem}}\n[[File:Temple Mount.JPG|thumb]]\n\nThe Great Muslim army siege Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636 CE. For four months, the siege continued. Ultimately, the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], an ethnic Arab,<ref>Donald E. Wagner. ''Dying in the Land of Promise: Palestine and Palestinian Christianity from Pentecost to 2000''</ref> agreed to surrender Jerusalem to [[caliph Omar]] in person. The caliph, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and travelled to [[Jerusalem]] to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Omar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or [[Umar's Assurance|Covenant of Omar]], allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for \"[[jizya]]\", a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called \"[[dhimmis]]\". Under Muslim Rule, the Jewish and Christian population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |year=1910 |title=Jerusalem}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Jew in the Medieval World: A Source Book, 315-1791 |last=Marcus |first=Jacob Rader |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |date=March 2000 |isbn=0-87820-217-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 13\u201315] |edition=Revised |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/jewinmedievalwor00marc/page/13 }}</ref>\n\nHaving accepted the surrender, Omar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius \"and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities\".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], ci, ed. Bury, London, 1898, V, 436</ref> When the hour for his prayer came, Omar was in the Anastasis church, but refused to pray there, lest in the future Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The [[Mosque of Omar]], opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.\n\nBishop [[Arculf]], whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, [[De Locis Sanctis]], written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule. The caliphs of Damascus (661-750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. St. John Damascene) held important offices at their court. The Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad (753-1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant to Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar (786-809), sent the keys of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.<ref name=\"Catholic Jerusalem\" />\n\nRival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. In the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the Shia Fatimid dynasty of North Africa. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Greeks continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Byzantines were put to death for high treason by the ruling shiite Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonous correspondence with the Byzantines. As Jerusalem grew in importance to Muslims and pilgrimages increased, tolerance for other religions declined. Christians were persecuted and churches destroyed. The sixth shia Fatimid caliph, [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Caliph Al-Hakim]], 996\u20131021, who was believed to be \"God made manifest\" by the [[Druze]], destroyed the Holy Sepulchre in 1009.

The name \"[[Gibraltar]]\" is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] derivation of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''Jabal T\u0101riq'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|\u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642}}}}) (meaning \"mountain of Tariq\"), named after him.\n\nThere are accounts of the [[Volga trade route|trade connections]] between the Muslims and the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], apparently Vikings who made their way towards the [[Black Sea]] through [[European Russia|Central Russia]].  On his way to Volga Bulgaria, [[Ibn Fadlan]] brought detailed reports of the Rus, claiming that some had converted to [[Islam]].\n\nAccording to the historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], the [[B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny]] (''Izmaelita or ''Ismaili{{\\}}[[Nizari]]'') denomination of the Muslims who lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 10th to 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary.\n\n====Hispania / Al-Andalus====\n{{see also|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 14-33-43.jpg|thumb|upright|The interior of the [[Cathedral\u2013Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba|Cathedral of Cordoba]], formerly the [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] was built in 742. It is one of the finest examples of [[Islamic architecture]] in the [[Umayyad]] style; inspired the design of other Mosques in [[Al-Andalus]].]]\nThe history of Arab and Islamic rule in the Iberian peninsula is probably one of the most studied periods of European history. For centuries after the Arab conquest, European accounts of Arab rule in Iberia were negative. European points of view started changing with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which resulted in new descriptions of the period of Islamic rule in Spain as a \"golden age\" (mostly as a reaction against Spain's militant Roman Catholicism after 1500){{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.\n\nThe tide of Arab expansion after 630 rolled through North Africa up to Ceuta in present-day Morocco. Their arrival coincided with a period of political weakness in the three centuries old kingdom established in the Iberian peninsula by the Germanic [[Visigoths]], who had taken over the region after seven centuries of Roman rule. Seizing the opportunity, an Arab-led (but mostly Berber) army invaded in 711, and by 720 had conquered the southern and central regions of the peninsula. The Arab expansion pushed over the mountains into southern [[France]], and for a short period Arabs controlled the old Visigothic province of Septimania (centered on present-day Narbonne). The Arab Caliphate was pushed back by [[Charles Martel]] (King of the Franks or French) at Poitiers, and Christian armies started pushing southwards over the mountains, until [[Charlemagne]] established in 801 the Spanish March (which stretched from Barcelona to present day Navarre).\n\nA major development in the history of Muslim Spain was the dynastic change in 750 in the Arab Caliphate, when an Umayyad Prince escaped the slaughter of his family in Damascus, fled to Cordoba in Spain, and created a new Islamic state in the area. This was the start of a distinctly Spanish Muslim society, where large Christian and Jewish populations coexisted with an increasing percentage of Muslims. There are many stories of descendants of Visigothic chieftains and Roman counts whose families converted to Islam during this period. The at-first small Muslim elite continued to grow with converts, and with a few exceptions, rulers in Islamic Spain allowed Christians and Jews the right specified in the Koran to practice their own religions, though non-Muslims suffered from political and taxation inequities. The net result was, in those areas of Spain where Muslim rule lasted the longest, the creation of a society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants, a process in some ways similar to the assimilation many years later of millions of immigrants to the United States into English-speaking culture.  As the descendants of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans concentrated in the north of the peninsula, in the kingdoms of Asturias/Leon, Navarre and Aragon and started a long campaign known as the 'Reconquista' which started with the victory of the Christian armies in [[Covadonga]] in 722.  Military campaigns continued without pause.  In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castille took back Toledo.  In 1212 the crucial [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] meant the recovery of the bulk of the peninsula for the Christian kingdoms.  In 1238 James I of Aragon  took Valencia.  In 1236 the ancient Roman city of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] was re-conquered by Ferdinand III of Castille and in 1248 the city of [[Seville]].  The famous medieval epic poem '[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]' narrates the life and deeds of this hero during the [[Reconquista]].\n\nThe Islamic state centered in Cordoba had ended up splintering into many smaller kingdoms (the so-called taifas). While Muslim Spain was fragmenting, the Christian kingdoms grew larger and stronger, and the balance of power shifted against the 'Taifa' kingdoms. The last Muslim kingdom of Granada in the south was finally taken in 1492 by Queen Isabelle of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1499, the remaining Muslim inhabitants were ordered to convert or leave (at the same time the Jews were expelled). Poorer Muslims ([[Moriscos]]) who could not afford to leave ended up converting to Catholic Christianity and hiding their Muslim practices, hiding from the Spanish Inquisition, until their presence was finally extinguished.\n\n====Balkans====\n{{see also|Rumelia|Balkans|Ottoman Empire}}\nIn Balkan history, historical writing on the topic of conversion to Islam was, and still is, a highly charged political issue. It is intrinsically linked to the issues of formation of national identities and rival territorial claims of the Balkan states. The generally accepted nationalist discourse of the current Balkan historiography defines all forms of Islamization as results of the Ottoman government's centrally organized policy of conversion or ''[[dawah]]''. The truth is that Islamization in each Balkan country took place in the course of many centuries, and its nature and phase was determined not by the Ottoman government but by the specific conditions of each locality. Ottoman conquests were initially military and economic enterprises, and religious conversions were not their primary objective. True, the statements surrounding victories all celebrated the incorporation of territory into Muslim domains, but the actual Ottoman focus was on taxation and making the realms productive, and a religious campaign would have disrupted that economic objective.\n\nOttoman Islamic standards of toleration allowed for autonomous \"nations\" (''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'') in the Empire, under their own personal law and under the rule of their own religious leaders. As a result, vast areas of the Balkans remained mostly Christian during the period of Ottoman domination. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches had a higher position in the Ottoman Empire, mainly because the Patriarch resided in Istanbul and was an officer of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast, Roman Catholics, while tolerated, were suspected of loyalty to a foreign power (the Papacy). It is no surprise that the Roman Catholic areas of Bosnia, Kosovo and northern Albania, ended up with more substantial conversions to Islam. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1699 by the Austrians resulted in their loss of Hungary and present-day Croatia. The remaining Muslim converts in both elected to leave \"lands of unbelief\" and moved to territory still under the Ottomans. Around this point in time, new European ideas of romantic nationalism started to seep into the Empire, and provided the intellectual foundation for new nationalistic ideologies and the reinforcement of the self-image of many Christian groups as subjugated peoples.\n\nAs a rule, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] did not require followers of Greek Orthodoxy to become [[Muslim]]s, although many did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1387&Itemid=90|title=PontosWorld|publisher=}}</ref> \nOne by one, the Balkan nationalities asserted their independence from the Empire, and frequently the presence of members of the same ethnicity who had converted to Islam presented a problem from the point of view of the now dominant new national ideology, which narrowly defined the nation as members of the local dominant Orthodox Christian denomination.<ref name=\"Blumi32\"/> Some Muslims in the Balkans chose to leave, while [[Persecution of Muslims|many others were forcefully expelled]] to what was left of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Blumi32\">{{cite book|last=Blumi|first=Isa|title=Reinstating the Ottomans, Alternative Balkan Modernities: 1800\u20131912|year=2011|location=New York  |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ca3IAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Reinstating+the+Ottomans,+Alternative+Balkan+Modernities:+1800-1912&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20expulsion%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9CTurks%E2%80%9D%20(i.e.%2C%20Muslims)&f=false|isbn=9780230119086|pages=32|ref=harv}}</ref>  This demographic transition can be illustrated by the decrease in the number of mosques in [[Belgrade]], from over 70 in 1750 (before Serbian independence in 1815), to only three in 1850.\n\n====Immigration====\nSince the 1960s, many Muslims have migrated to Western Europe.

It is often prepared as a cold [[soup]], popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add [[bread]]. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with [[lettuce]] or [[carrot]]s.\n\nA thicker variation is sometimes known as \"dry tarator\" , or as \"''Snezhanka''\" salad (\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \"\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430\"), which means \"[[Snow white salad]]\", and is served as an appetizer or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water.  The cucumbers, garlic, minced [[walnuts]], [[salt]] and vegetable oil are then added. \n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], tarator is a popular meze (appetizer) but is also served as a side dish along with [[Shopska salad]] with most meals. [[Sunflower oil]] and [[Olive oil]] are more commonly used, and the [[walnut]]s are sometimes omitted. Tarator is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It's a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.\n\nIn [[Albania]], tarator is a very popular dish in the summertime. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yogurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squid is often offered with Tarator.\n\n===Cyprus===\nIn [[Cyprus]], the dish is known as \"\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\" (talattouri)<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Susanna|title=The olive and the caper: adventures in Greek cooking|year=2004|publisher=Workman|isbn=978-1-56305-848-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa|url-access=registration}}</ref> and is not a soup like Bulgarian tarator but more of a dipping sauce. \n\nIt is made from strained yogurt,  sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves and sprinkled with oregano and sometimes olive oil.\n\n===Middle East===\nIn [[Iraq]], ''jajeek'' is often served as [[meze]].<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/> It may  accompany alcoholic drinks, especially [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an [[Ouzo]]-like drink made from [[Date Palm|dates]]. In [[Iran]] it is known as ''mast o khiar''.<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/>\n\n===Similar dishes===\nA variation in the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] mountains, called ovdukh, uses [[kefir]] instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and [[ham]] to create a variation of [[okroshka]], sometimes referred to as a 'Caucasus okroshka'. [[Mizeria]] is another variation from Poland, using the same ingredients but substituting sour cream for yogurt.\n\nIn South Asia a similar dish is made with yoghurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called [[raita]].\n\nIn Iran, [[ash-e doogh]] is another type of yogurt soup; instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as [[basil]], [[leek]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[black pepper]] and [[raisin]]s. In this style, sometimes dried bread chips, chopped nuts or raisins are put in the dish just before serving.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold borscht]]\n* [[Dipping sauce#List of common dips]]\n* [[List of hors d'oeuvre]]\n* [[List of yogurt-based dishes and beverages]]\n* [[List of dairy products]]\n* [[Qatiq]]\n* [[Raita]]\n* [[Snow white salad]]\n* [[Toum]]\n{{portal bar|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yogurts}}\n{{Cuisine of Greece}}\n{{Cuisine of the Mediterranean}}\n\n[[Category:Appetizers]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Cold soups]]\n[[Category:Cypriot cuisine]]\n[[Category:Dips (food)]]\n[[Category:Fermented dairy products]]\n[[Category:Greek cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meze]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sauces]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Turkish soups]]\n[[Category:Western Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:White sauces]]\n[[Category:Yogurt-based dishes]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{short description|Cold cucumber-yogurt soup}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Tzatziki\n| image = Cacik-1.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption          = \n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| creator          = \n| course           = [[Appetizer]], [[side dish]], [[meze]]\n| type             = [[Dip (food)|Dip]] or [[soup]]\n| served           = Cold\n| main_ingredient  = [[Strained yogurt]], [[cucumber]]s, [[garlic]], [[olive oil]], [[salt]], sometimes [[lemon juice]], [[dill]], [[mentha|mint]], or [[parsley]]\n| variations       = With strained or diluted yoghurt and other herbs and vegetables\n| calories         = \n| other            = \n}}\n'''Tzatziki''', '''cac\u0131k''' or '''tarator''' is a [[Dip (food)|dip]], [[soup]], or [[sauce]] found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East.

It is often prepared as a cold [[soup]], popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add [[bread]]. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with [[lettuce]] or [[carrot]]s.\n\nA thicker variation is sometimes known as \"dry tarator\" , or as \"''Snezhanka''\" salad (\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \"\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430\"), which means \"[[Snow white salad]]\", and is served as an appetizer or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water.  The cucumbers, garlic, minced [[walnuts]], [[salt]] and vegetable oil are then added. \n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], tarator is a popular meze (appetizer) but is also served as a side dish along with [[Shopska salad]] with most meals. [[Sunflower oil]] and [[Olive oil]] are more commonly used, and the [[walnut]]s are sometimes omitted. Tarator is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It's a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.\n\nIn [[Albania]], tarator is a very popular dish in the summertime. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yoghurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squid is often offered with Tarator.\n\n===Cyprus===\nIn [[Cyprus]], the dish is known as \"\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\" (talattouri)<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Susanna|title=The olive and the caper: adventures in Greek cooking|year=2004|publisher=Workman|isbn=978-1-56305-848-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa|url-access=registration}}</ref> and is not a soup like Bulgarian tarator but more of a dipping sauce. \n\nIt is made from strained yogurt,  sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves and sprinkled with oregano and sometimes olive oil.\n\n===Middle East===\nIn [[Iraq]], ''jajeek'' is often served as [[meze]].<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/> It may  accompany alcoholic drinks, especially [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an [[Ouzo]]-like drink made from [[Date Palm|dates]]. In [[Iran]] it is known as ''mast o khiar''.<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/>\n\n===Similar dishes===\nA variation in the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] mountains, called ovdukh, uses [[kefir]] instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and [[ham]] to create a variation of [[okroshka]], sometimes referred to as a 'Caucasus okroshka'. [[Mizeria]] is another variation from Poland, using the same ingredients but substituting sour cream for yogurt.\n\nIn South Asia a similar dish is made with yoghurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called [[raita]].\n\nIn Iran, [[ash-e doogh]] is another type of yogurt soup; instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as [[basil]], [[leek]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[black pepper]] and [[raisin]]s. In this style, sometimes dried bread chips, chopped nuts or raisins are put in the dish just before serving.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold borscht]]\n* [[Dipping sauce#List of common dips]]\n* [[List of hors d'oeuvre]]\n* [[List of yogurt-based dishes and beverages]]\n* [[List of dairy products]]\n* [[Qatiq]]\n* [[Raita]]\n* [[Snow white salad]]\n* [[Toum]]\n{{portal bar|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yogurts}}\n{{Cuisine of Greece}}\n{{Cuisine of the Mediterranean}}\n\n[[Category:Appetizers]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Cold soups]]\n[[Category:Cypriot cuisine]]\n[[Category:Dips (food)]]\n[[Category:Fermented dairy products]]\n[[Category:Greek cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meze]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sauces]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Turkish soups]]\n[[Category:Western Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:White sauces]]\n[[Category:Yogurt-based dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Brrgdw", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBalkans:changed spelling of \"yoghurt\" to \"yogurt\" for consistancy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzatziki"}

Lineback, \"Starch\", in AccessScience@McGraw-Hill.</ref>\nAmylose is a much smaller molecule than amylopectin. About one quarter of the mass of starch granules in plants consist of amylose, although there are about 150 times more amylose than amylopectin molecules.\n\nStarch molecules arrange themselves in the plant in semi-crystalline granules. Each plant species has a unique starch granular size:  rice starch is relatively small (about 2&nbsp;\u03bcm) while [[potato starch]]es have larger granules (up to 100&nbsp;\u03bcm).\n\nStarch becomes soluble in water when heated. The granules swell and burst, the semi-crystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule, forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixture's [[viscosity]]. This process is called [[starch gelatinization]]. During [[cooking]], the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity. During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste, the semi-crystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens, expelling water. This is mainly caused by [[retrogradation (starch)|retrogradation]] of the amylose. This process is responsible for the hardening of bread or [[staling]], and for the water layer on top of a starch gel ([[syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]]).\n\nSome cultivated plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose, known as ''waxy starches''. The most used is [[waxy corn|waxy maize]], others are [[glutinous rice]] and [[waxy potato starch]]. Waxy starches have less retrogradation, resulting in a more stable paste. High amylose starch, [[amylomaize]], is cultivated for the use of its gel strength and for use as a [[resistant starch]] (a starch that resists digestion) in food products.\n\nSynthetic amylose made from cellulose has a well-controlled degree of polymerization. Therefore, it can be used as a potential drug deliver carrier.<ref name=\"pnas.org\"/>\n\nCertain starches, when mixed with water, will produce a [[Non-Newtonian fluid#Oobleck|non-newtonian fluid]] sometimes nicknamed \"oobleck\".\n\n===Hydrolysis===\nThe [[enzyme]]s that break down or [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] starch into the constituent sugars are known as [[amylase]]s.\n\nAlpha-amylases are found in plants and in animals.

It is made by adding 3&nbsp;grams of soluble starch to 1 liter of heated water; the solution is cooled before use (starch-iodine complex becomes unstable at temperatures above 35&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nEach species of plant has a unique type of starch granules in granular size, shape and crystallization pattern. Under the [[microscope]], starch grains stained with iodine illuminated from behind with [[polarized light]] show a distinctive [[Maltese cross]] effect (also known as [[extinction cross]] and [[birefringence]]).\n\n==Food==\n<!-- {{noredirect|Starchy food}} links here-->\nStarch is the most common [[carbohydrate]] in the human diet and is contained in many [[staple food]]s. The major sources of starch intake worldwide are the [[cereal]]s ([[rice]], [[wheat]], and [[maize]]) and the [[root vegetable]]s ([[potato]]es and [[cassava]]).<ref>Anne-Charlotte Eliasson (2004). ''Starch in food: Structure, function and applications''. Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-2555-7}}.</ref> Many other starchy foods are grown, some only in specific climates, including [[acorn]]s, [[arrowroot]], [[arracacha]], [[banana]]s, [[barley]], [[breadfruit]], [[buckwheat]], [[canna (plant)|canna]], [[colocasia]], [[katakuri]], [[kudzu]], [[Xanthosoma sagittifolium|malanga]], [[millet]], [[oat]]s, [[oxalis tuberosa|oca]], [[polynesian arrowroot]], [[sago]], [[sorghum]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[rye]], [[taro]], [[chestnut]]s, [[Water caltrop|water chestnut]]s and [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], and many kinds of [[bean]]s, such as [[vicia faba|favas]], [[lentil]]s, [[mung bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[chickpea]]s.\n\nWidely used prepared foods containing starch are [[bread]], [[pancake]]s, [[cereal]]s, [[noodle]]s, [[pasta]], [[porridge]] and [[tortilla]].\n\n[[digestion|Digestive]] enzymes have problems digesting crystalline structures. Raw starch is digested poorly in the [[duodenum]] and [[small intestine]], while bacterial degradation takes place mainly in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]. When starch is cooked, the digestibility is increased.\n\nStarch gelatinization during cake [[baking]] can be impaired by sugar competing for [[water]], preventing gelatinization and improving texture.\n\nBefore the advent of processed foods, people consumed large amounts of uncooked and unprocessed starch-containing plants, which contained high amounts of [[resistant starch]]. Microbes within the large intestine fermented the starch, produced [[short-chain fatty acids]], which are used as energy, and support the maintenance and growth of the microbes. More highly processed foods are more easily digested and release more glucose in the small intestine\u2014less starch reaches the large intestine and more energy is absorbed by the body. It is thought that this shift in energy delivery (as a result of eating more processed foods) may be one of the contributing factors to the development of metabolic disorders of modern life, including obesity and diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=Jens |last2=Ley |first2=Ruth |title=The Human Gut Microbiome: Ecology and Recent Evolutionary Changes |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |date=October 2011 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=422\u2013429 |doi=10.1146/annurev-micro-090110-102830 |pmid=21682646}}</ref>\n\n===Starch production===\nThe starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are [[cornstarch]], [[tapioca]], arrowroot,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/arrowroot |title=Arrowroot recipes |website=BBC Food|date=  |author=Hemsley + Hemsley |accessdate= 13 August 2017}}</ref> and wheat, rice, and [[potato starch]]es. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet potato, sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.\n\nUntreated starch requires heat to thicken or gelatinize. When a starch is pre-cooked, it can then be used to thicken instantly in cold water. This is referred to as a [[Starch gelatinization|pregelatinized starch]].\n\n====Starch sugars====\nStarch can be [[hydrolyzed]] into simpler carbohydrates by [[acid]]s, various [[enzyme]]s, or a combination of the two. The resulting fragments are known as [[dextrin]]s. The extent of conversion is typically quantified by '''''[[dextrose equivalent]]''''' (DE), which is roughly the fraction of the [[glycosidic bond]]s in starch that have been broken.\n\nThese starch sugars are by far the most common starch based food ingredient and are used as sweeteners in many drinks and foods. They include:\n\n* [[Maltodextrin]], a lightly hydrolyzed (DE 10\u201320) starch product used as a bland-tasting filler and thickener.\n* Various [[glucose syrup]]s (DE 30\u201370), also called [[corn syrup]]s in the US, viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods.\n* [[Dextrose]] (DE 100), commercial glucose, prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch.\n* High [[fructose]] syrup, made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme [[glucose isomerase]], until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose. In the United States sugar prices are two to three times higher than in the rest of the world;<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/21/hfcs-versus-sugar-a-modest-proposal-for-a-solution/ Forbes: HFCS Versus Sugar: A Modest Proposal for a Solution, 21 March 2012]</ref> [[high-fructose corn syrup]] is significantly cheaper, and is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages.<ref>[http://www.beveragedaily.com/Markets/Sugar-is-much-much-bigger-Rocketing-HFCS-prices-don-t-spook-Coke-CEO Beverage daily: 'Sugar is much, much bigger': Rocketing HFCS prices don't spook Coke CEO]</ref> Fructose also has better microbiological stability.

Typical modified starches for technical applications are [[Paper chemicals#Cationic starch|cationic starch]]es, hydroxyethyl starch and carboxymethylated starches.\n\n====Use as food additive====\nAs an additive for [[food processing]], food starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings, custards, soups, sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and salad dressings, and to make noodles and pastas. They function as thickeners, extenders, emulsion stabilizers and are exceptional binders in processed meats.\n\nGummed sweets such as [[jelly bean]]s and [[wine gum]]s are not manufactured using a mold in the conventional sense. A tray is filled with native starch and leveled. A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1,000 or so jelly beans. The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put onto a stove to set. This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured.\n\n====Use in pharmaceutical industry ====\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, starch is also used as an [[excipient]], as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] disintegrant, and as binder.\n\n====Resistant starch====\n{{Main|Resistant starch}}\n\n[[Resistant starch]] is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals.\nHigh amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through [[baking]], mild [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble [[dietary fiber]] in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits.

Both chemically modified and unmodified starches are used in papermaking. In the wet part of the papermaking process, generally called the \"wet-end\", the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer. These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers / [[cellulose]] and inorganic fillers. Cationic starches together with other retention and internal [[sizing]] agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process ([[wet strength]]), and to provide strength to the final paper sheet (dry strength).\n\nIn the dry end of the papermaking process, the paper web is rewetted with a starch based solution. The process is called [[sizing|surface sizing]]. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses (size presses). Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or \"size\" for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings as one of the binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners. [[Coated paper]] has improved smoothness, hardness, whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics.\n\n===Corrugated board adhesives===\n[[Corrugated board]] adhesives are the next largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch [[glue]]s are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as [[borax]] and [[caustic soda]]. Part of the starch is gelatinized to carry the slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the fluting. The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes the rest of the uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production.\n\n===Clothing starch===\nClothing or laundry starch is a liquid  prepared by mixing a vegetable starch in water (earlier preparations also had to be boiled), and is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. [[File:Rice-starch-pack-shot.jpg|thumb|Rice starch for ironing, still available in Germany and Austria]] During the 19th and early 20th century it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of women's [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Starch gave clothing smooth, crisp edges, and had an additional practical purpose: [[Dust|dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing. The dirt would wash away along with the starch; after laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today, in many cultures, starch is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use, but in others it remain available in granular form for mixing with water.\n\n===Other===\nAnother large non-food starch application is in the construction industry, where starch is used in the gypsum [[wall board]] manufacturing process. Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily [[gypsum]]. Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation, and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid wall board. The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering, and also provide rigidity to the board.\n\nStarch is used in the manufacture of various '''adhesives''' or glues<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/apr00/wood0400.htm | title = Stuck on Starch: A new wood adhesive | publisher = US Department of Agriculture|year = 2000}}</ref> for book-binding, [[wallpaper adhesive]]s, [[paper bag#Multiwall paper sacks|paper sack]] production, tube winding, [[Gum tape|gummed paper]], envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or [[soda ash]], which are mixed with the starch solution at {{convert|50|\u2013|70|C}} to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.\n\n*Textile chemicals from starch: [[warp (weaving)|warp]] [[Textile warp sizing|sizing agents]] are used to reduce breaking of [[yarn]]s during [[weaving]]. Starch is mainly used to size [[cotton]] based yarns. Modified starch is also used as [[textile printing]] thickener.\n*In oil exploration, starch is used to adjust the viscosity of [[drilling fluid]], which is used to lubricate the drill head and suspend the grinding residue in petroleum extraction.\n*Starch is also used to make some [[packing peanut]]s, and some [[dropped ceiling|drop ceiling]] tiles.\n*In the [[printing]] industry, food grade starch<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.russell-webb.com/anti_set_off_powder/soluble_anti-set-off-powder.html\n| title = Spray Powder | publisher = Russell-Webb | accessdate = 2007-07-05\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809214841/http://www.russell-webb.com/anti_set_off_powder/soluble_anti-set-off-powder.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-09}}</ref> is used in the manufacture of [[anti-set-off spray powder]] used to separate printed sheets of paper to avoid wet ink being [[set-off (printing)|set off]].\n*For body powder, powdered corn starch is used as a substitute for [[talcum]] powder, and similarly in other health and beauty products.\n*Starch is used to produce various [[bioplastic]]s, synthetic polymers that are biodegradable. An example is [[polylactic acid]] based on glucose from starch.\n*Glucose from starch can be further fermented to [[biofuel]] [[corn ethanol]] using the so-called [[wet milling]] process.

It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and [[helix|helical]] [[amylose]] and the branched [[amylopectin]].

The [[Greek language|Greek]] term for starch, \"amylon\" (\u1f04\u03bc\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd), is also related. It provides the root [[wikt:amyl|amyl]], which is used as a prefix for several [[Pentyl|5-carbon]] compounds related to or derived from starch (e.g. [[amyl alcohol]]).\n\n==History==\nStarch grains from the [[rhizome]]s of ''[[Typha]]'' (cattails, bullrushes) as [[flour]] have been identified from [[grinding stone]]s in Europe dating back to 30,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Revedin\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1006993107 |title=Thirty thousand-year-old evidence of plant food processing |year=2010 |last1=Revedin |first1=A. |last2=Aranguren |first2=B. |last3=Becattini |first3=R. |last4=Longo |first4=L. |last5=Marconi |first5=E. |last6=Lippi |first6=M.

Lineback, \"Starch\", in AccessScience@McGraw-Hill.</ref>\nAmylose is a much smaller molecule than amylopectin. About one quarter of the mass of starch granules in plants consist of amylose, although there are about 150 times more amylose than amylopectin molecules.\n\nStarch molecules arrange themselves in the plant in semi-crystalline granules. Each plant species has a unique starch granular size:  rice starch is relatively small (about 2&nbsp;\u03bcm) while [[potato starch]]es have larger granules (up to 100&nbsp;\u03bcm).\n\nStarch becomes soluble in water when heated. The granules swell and burst, the semi-crystalline structure is lost and the smaller amylose molecules start leaching out of the granule, forming a network that holds water and increasing the mixture's [[viscosity]]. This process is called [[starch gelatinization]]. During [[cooking]], the starch becomes a paste and increases further in viscosity. During cooling or prolonged storage of the paste, the semi-crystalline structure partially recovers and the starch paste thickens, expelling water. This is mainly caused by [[retrogradation (starch)|retrogradation]] of the amylose. This process is responsible for the hardening of bread or [[staling]], and for the water layer on top of a starch gel ([[syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]]).\n\nSome cultivated plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose, known as ''waxy starches''. The most used is [[waxy corn|waxy maize]], others are [[glutinous rice]] and [[waxy potato starch]]. Waxy starches have less retrogradation, resulting in a more stable paste. High amylose starch, [[amylomaize]], is cultivated for the use of its gel strength and for use as a [[resistant starch]] (a starch that resists digestion) in food products.\n\nSynthetic amylose made from cellulose has a well-controlled degree of polymerization. Therefore, it can be used as a potential drug deliver carrier.<ref name=\"pnas.org\"/>\n\nCertain starches, when mixed with water, will produce a [[Non-Newtonian fluid#Oobleck|non-newtonian fluid]] sometimes nicknamed \"oobleck\".\n\n===Hydrolysis===\nThe [[enzyme]]s that break down or [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] starch into the constituent sugars are known as [[amylase]]s.\n\nAlpha-amylases are found in plants and in animals.

Waxy starches with little or no amylose present will color red. Benedict's test and Fehling's test is also done to indicate the presence of starch.\n\n[[Starch indicator]] solution consisting of water, starch and iodide is often used in [[redox]] titrations: in the presence of an [[oxidizing agent]] the solution turns blue, in the presence of [[reducing agent]] the blue color disappears because [[triiodide]] (I<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>) ions break up into three iodide ions, disassembling the starch-iodine complex. Starch solution was used as indicator for visualizing the periodic formation and consumption of triiodide intermediate in the [[Briggs\u2013Rauscher reaction|Briggs-Rauscher]] oscillating reaction. The starch, however, changes the [[Chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of the reaction steps involving triiodide ion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Csepei|first=L.

It is made by adding 3&nbsp;grams of soluble starch to 1 liter of heated water; the solution is cooled before use (starch-iodine complex becomes unstable at temperatures above 35&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nEach species of plant has a unique type of starch granules in granular size, shape and crystallization pattern. Under the [[microscope]], starch grains stained with iodine illuminated from behind with [[polarized light]] show a distinctive [[Maltese cross]] effect (also known as [[extinction cross]] and [[birefringence]]).\n\n==Food==\n<!-- {{noredirect|Starchy food}} links here-->\nStarch is the most common [[carbohydrate]] in the human diet and is contained in many [[staple food]]s. The major sources of starch intake worldwide are the [[cereal]]s ([[rice]], [[wheat]], and [[maize]]) and the [[root vegetable]]s ([[potato]]es and [[cassava]]).<ref>Anne-Charlotte Eliasson (2004). ''Starch in food: Structure, function and applications''. Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-2555-7}}.</ref> Many other starchy foods are grown, some only in specific climates, including [[acorn]]s, [[arrowroot]], [[arracacha]], [[banana]]s, [[barley]], [[breadfruit]], [[buckwheat]], [[canna (plant)|canna]], [[colocasia]], [[katakuri]], [[kudzu]], [[Xanthosoma sagittifolium|malanga]], [[millet]], [[oat]]s, [[oxalis tuberosa|oca]], [[polynesian arrowroot]], [[sago]], [[sorghum]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[rye]], [[taro]], [[chestnut]]s, [[Water caltrop|water chestnut]]s and [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], and many kinds of [[bean]]s, such as [[vicia faba|favas]], [[lentil]]s, [[mung bean]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[chickpea]]s.\n\nWidely used prepared foods containing starch are [[bread]], [[pancake]]s, [[cereal]]s, [[noodle]]s, [[pasta]], [[porridge]] and [[tortilla]].\n\n[[digestion|Digestive]] enzymes have problems digesting crystalline structures. Raw starch is digested poorly in the [[duodenum]] and [[small intestine]], while bacterial degradation takes place mainly in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]. When starch is cooked, the digestibility is increased.\n\nStarch gelatinization during cake [[baking]] can be impaired by sugar competing for [[water]], preventing gelatinization and improving texture.\n\nBefore the advent of processed foods, people consumed large amounts of uncooked and unprocessed starch-containing plants, which contained high amounts of [[resistant starch]]. Microbes within the large intestine fermented the starch, produced [[short-chain fatty acids]], which are used as energy, and support the maintenance and growth of the microbes. More highly processed foods are more easily digested and release more glucose in the small intestine\u2014less starch reaches the large intestine and more energy is absorbed by the body. It is thought that this shift in energy delivery (as a result of eating more processed foods) may be one of the contributing factors to the development of metabolic disorders of modern life, including obesity and diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=Jens |last2=Ley |first2=Ruth |title=The Human Gut Microbiome: Ecology and Recent Evolutionary Changes |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |date=October 2011 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=422\u2013429 |doi=10.1146/annurev-micro-090110-102830 |pmid=21682646}}</ref>\n\n===Starch production===\nThe starch industry extracts and refines starches from seeds, roots and tubers, by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are [[cornstarch]], [[tapioca]], arrowroot,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/arrowroot |title=Arrowroot recipes |website=BBC Food|date=  |author=Hemsley + Hemsley |accessdate= 13 August 2017}}</ref> and wheat, rice, and [[potato starch]]es. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet potato, sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.\n\nUntreated starch requires heat to thicken or gelatinize. When a starch is pre-cooked, it can then be used to thicken instantly in cold water. This is referred to as a [[Starch gelatinization|pregelatinized starch]].\n\n====Starch sugars====\nStarch can be [[hydrolyzed]] into simpler carbohydrates by [[acid]]s, various [[enzyme]]s, or a combination of the two. The resulting fragments are known as [[dextrin]]s. The extent of conversion is typically quantified by '''''[[dextrose equivalent]]''''' (DE), which is roughly the fraction of the [[glycosidic bond]]s in starch that have been broken.\n\nThese starch sugars are by far the most common starch based food ingredient and are used as sweeteners in many drinks and foods. They include:\n\n* [[Maltodextrin]], a lightly hydrolyzed (DE 10\u201320) starch product used as a bland-tasting filler and thickener.\n* Various [[glucose syrup]]s (DE 30\u201370), also called [[corn syrup]]s in the US, viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods.\n* [[Dextrose]] (DE 100), commercial glucose, prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch.\n* High [[fructose]] syrup, made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme [[glucose isomerase]], until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose. In the United States sugar prices are two to three times higher than in the rest of the world;<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/21/hfcs-versus-sugar-a-modest-proposal-for-a-solution/ Forbes: HFCS Versus Sugar: A Modest Proposal for a Solution, 21 March 2012]</ref> [[high-fructose corn syrup]] is significantly cheaper, and is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages.<ref>[http://www.beveragedaily.com/Markets/Sugar-is-much-much-bigger-Rocketing-HFCS-prices-don-t-spook-Coke-CEO Beverage daily: 'Sugar is much, much bigger': Rocketing HFCS prices don't spook Coke CEO]</ref> Fructose also has better microbiological stability. One kind of high fructose corn syrup, HFCS-55, is sweeter than [[sucrose]] because it is made with more fructose, while the sweetness of HFCS-42 is on par with sucrose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/549sweet.html|title= Sweetners \u2013 Introduction|publisher = Elmhurst College|author = Ophardt, Charles}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2008/12/hfcs-how-sweet-it-is.aspx|title = HFCS: How Sweet It Is|date=December 2, 2008|first= John S.|last= White}}</ref>\n* [[Sugar alcohol]]s, such as [[maltitol]], [[erythritol]], [[sorbitol]], [[mannitol]] and [[hydrogenated starch hydrolysate]], are sweeteners made by reducing sugars.\n\n====Modified starches====\nA [[modified starch]] is a starch that has been chemically modified to allow the starch to function properly under conditions frequently encountered during processing or storage, such as high heat, high shear, low pH, freeze/thaw and cooling.\n\nThe modified food starches are [[E number|E coded]] according to the [[Codex Alimentarius|International Numbering System]] for Food Additives (INS):<ref>[http://www.fao.org/ag/agn/jecfa-additives/specs/Monograph1/Additive-287.pdf Modified Starches].

Typical modified starches for technical applications are [[Paper chemicals#Cationic starch|cationic starch]]es, hydroxyethyl starch and carboxymethylated starches.\n\n====Use as food additive====\nAs an additive for [[food processing]], food starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings, custards, soups, sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and salad dressings, and to make noodles and pastas. They function as thickeners, extenders, emulsion stabilizers and are exceptional binders in processed meats.\n\nGummed sweets such as [[jelly bean]]s and [[wine gum]]s are not manufactured using a mold in the conventional sense. A tray is filled with native starch and leveled. A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1,000 or so jelly beans. The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put onto a stove to set. This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured.\n\n====Use in pharmaceutical industry ====\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, starch is also used as an [[excipient]], as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] disintegrant, and as binder.\n\n====Resistant starch====\n{{Main|Resistant starch}}\n\n[[Resistant starch]] is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals.\nHigh amylose starch from corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch and retains its resistant starch content through [[baking]], mild [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble [[dietary fiber]] in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits.

Both chemically modified and unmodified starches are used in papermaking. In the wet part of the papermaking process, generally called the \"wet-end\", the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer. These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers / [[cellulose]] and inorganic fillers. Cationic starches together with other retention and internal [[sizing]] agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process ([[wet strength]]), and to provide strength to the final paper sheet (dry strength).\n\nIn the dry end of the papermaking process, the paper web is rewetted with a starch based solution. The process is called [[sizing|surface sizing]]. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses (size presses). Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or \"size\" for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings as one of the binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners. [[Coated paper]] has improved smoothness, hardness, whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics.\n\n===Corrugated board adhesives===\n[[Corrugated board]] adhesives are the next largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch [[glue]]s are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as [[borax]] and [[caustic soda]]. Part of the starch is gelatinized to carry the slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the fluting. The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes the rest of the uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production.\n\n===Clothing starch===\nClothing or laundry starch is a liquid  prepared by mixing a vegetable starch in water (earlier preparations also had to be boiled), and is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. [[File:Rice-starch-pack-shot.jpg|thumb|Rice starch for ironing, still available in Germany and Austria]] During the 19th and early 20th century it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of women's [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Starch gave clothing smooth, crisp edges, and had an additional practical purpose: [[Dust|dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing. The dirt would wash away along with the starch; after laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today, in many cultures, starch is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use, but in others it remain available in granular form for mixing with water.\n\n===Other===\nAnother large non-food starch application is in the construction industry, where starch is used in the gypsum [[wall board]] manufacturing process. Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily [[gypsum]]. Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation, and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid wall board. The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering, and also provide rigidity to the board.\n\nStarch is used in the manufacture of various '''adhesives''' or glues<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/apr00/wood0400.htm | title = Stuck on Starch: A new wood adhesive | publisher = US Department of Agriculture|year = 2000}}</ref> for book-binding, [[wallpaper adhesive]]s, [[paper bag#Multiwall paper sacks|paper sack]] production, tube winding, [[Gum tape|gummed paper]], envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or [[soda ash]], which are mixed with the starch solution at {{convert|50|\u2013|70|C}} to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.\n\n*Textile chemicals from starch: [[warp (weaving)|warp]] [[Textile warp sizing|sizing agents]] are used to reduce breaking of [[yarn]]s during [[weaving]]. Starch is mainly used to size [[cotton]] based yarns. Modified starch is also used as [[textile printing]] thickener.\n*In oil exploration, starch is used to adjust the viscosity of [[drilling fluid]], which is used to lubricate the drill head and suspend the grinding residue in petroleum extraction.\n*Starch is also used to make some [[packing peanut]]s, and some [[dropped ceiling|drop ceiling]] tiles.\n*In the [[printing]] industry, food grade starch<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.russell-webb.com/anti_set_off_powder/soluble_anti-set-off-powder.html\n| title = Spray Powder | publisher = Russell-Webb | accessdate = 2007-07-05\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809214841/http://www.russell-webb.com/anti_set_off_powder/soluble_anti-set-off-powder.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-09}}</ref> is used in the manufacture of [[anti-set-off spray powder]] used to separate printed sheets of paper to avoid wet ink being [[set-off (printing)|set off]].\n*For body powder, powdered corn starch is used as a substitute for [[talcum]] powder, and similarly in other health and beauty products.\n*Starch is used to produce various [[bioplastic]]s, synthetic polymers that are biodegradable. An example is [[polylactic acid]] based on glucose from starch.\n*Glucose from starch can be further fermented to [[biofuel]] [[corn ethanol]] using the so-called [[wet milling]] process. Today most [[bioethanol]] production plants use the dry milling process to ferment corn or other feedstock directly to ethanol.<ref>[http://www.ethanol.org/index.php?id=37&parentid=8 American coalition for ethanol, Ethanol facilities]</ref>\n*[[Hydrogen production#Enzymatic hydrogen generation|Hydrogen production]] could use glucose from starch as the raw material, using enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway |year=2007 |editor1-last=Melis |editor1-first=Anastasios |last1=Zhang |first1=Y.-H.
