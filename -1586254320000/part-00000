The eastern boundary of Ilkeston is only two miles from Nottingham's western edge and it is part of the [[Nottingham Urban Area]].\n\n==History and culture==\n\nIlkeston was probably founded in the 6th century AD, and gets its name from its supposed founder, Elch or Elcha, who was an [[East Anglia|Anglian]] chieftain (\"Elka's Tun\" = Elka's Town). The town appears as Tilchestune in the [[Domesday Book]] when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent. Gilbert also controlled nearby [[Shipley, Derbyshire|Shipley]], [[West Hallam]] and [[Stanton by Dale]].<ref name = \"Domesday1\">''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-143994-7}} p.753-4</ref> Ilkeston was created a borough by Queen Victoria in 1887.\n\nIlkeston is one of several places where the distinctive dialect of [[East Midlands English]] is extensively spoken.

There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the [[Wellingborough Tramway|Wellingborough Iron Company]] in 1932.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=3}}</ref>\n\nSteel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after World War I and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the 'spun pipe' process. \n[[File:Ilkeston Stanton Ironworks Wagon small.jpg|thumbnail|left|A restored Stanton Wagon, Chalons Way, Ilkeston]]\nIn the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Scott-Parker iscottparker@pishtush.com |url=http://www.pishtush.com/camwrangler/z031110.html |title=ODAAT: one day at a time...

It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S&S manhole cover or lamp post.\n\nThe works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French [[Saint-Gobain]] Group.

This makes the fair older than [[Nottingham]]'s famous [[Nottingham Goose Fair|Goose Fair]] and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.\n\nThe present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another 'agricultural hiring fair' or 'Statutes Fair' was traditionally held on [[Wakes week]] in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.\n\nSince 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive)  reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n\nIlkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the [[Midland Main Line]] (formerly part of the [[Midland Railway]], later the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Due to recent rail reopenings in similarly-sized towns it was, by some definitions, one of the largest towns in Britain with no railway station. Ilkeston once had three stations. [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]], also known as \"Ilkeston Junction & Cossall\" was on the former [[Midland Railway]] and later [[London Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to [[Ilkeston Town railway station|Ilkeston Town station]], at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.\n\nIlkeston's third station was [[Ilkeston North railway station|Ilkeston North]], on the former [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (later [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]]) line from Nottingham to [[Derby Friargate railway station|Derby Friargate station]], closed in September 1964.  A major feature of this line was [[Bennerley Viaduct]], a {{convert|1452|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|61|ft|m|adj=on}} high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston.  Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the removal of the embankments at either end have left it an oddly isolated free-standing structure surrounded by fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceseastwood.co.uk/photo_016.htm|title=Bennerley Viaduct}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites 'most likely' to get a new station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing \u00a35 million and sited close to the old [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21948348 |title=BBC News |date=26 March 2013 }}</ref> On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston station]]. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines and was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2014.\n\nDue to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed.\nThe new station opened on 2 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134611/http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Buses===\n[[TrentBarton]] operate the majority of buses around Ilkeston including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, TheTwo and 21 into Nottingham, Black Cat to Mansfield, My15 to Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport <ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/bus-information/route-list}</ref><ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/userfiles/Ilkeston.pdf}</ref>\n[[Notts + Derby]] and CT4N operate some [[Derbyshire County Council]] tendered routes around Ilkeston.<ref>{http://www.derbysbus.info/places_index/ilkeston.html}</ref>\n\n==Ilkeston spa baths==\nFrom early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel.<ref>History of Ilkeston 1899 page 252</ref> For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity.  'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] played one or two [[first-class cricket]] matches per season on the [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston|Rutland Recreation Ground]] between 1925 and 1994 and [[List A cricket|one-day matches]] at the ground from 1970 to 1994.\n\nLocal football club [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] was liquidated in 2010, after a 114-year history. It was reformed as [[Ilkeston F.C.]] in 2011, which was in turn liquidated in 2017. \nIn July 2017 a new club, [[Ilkeston Town F.C.]] founded by Notts County chairman Alan Hardy, replaced the liquidated Ilkeston FC, and will play at the New Manor Ground in Ilkeston.\n\nLocal rugby club Ilkeston RUFC - known as the \"Elks\" - formed in 1926. The home ground in the town is called The Stute.\n\nThere are also two main basketball teams situated in Ilkeston; the Ilkeston Hawks and Ilkeston Falcons.

The eastern boundary of Ilkeston is only two miles from Nottingham's western edge and it is part of the [[Nottingham Urban Area]].\n\n==History and culture==\n\nIlkeston was probably founded in the 6th century AD, and gets its name from its supposed founder, Elch or Elcha, who was an [[East Anglia|Anglian]] chieftain (\"Elka's Tun\" = Elka's Town). The town appears as Tilchestune in the [[Domesday Book]] when it was owned principally by Gilbert de Ghent. Gilbert also controlled nearby [[Shipley, Derbyshire|Shipley]], [[West Hallam]] and [[Stanton by Dale]].<ref name = \"Domesday1\">''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''.

There has been evidence of iron working and quarrying in the area since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and the industry began blossoming into a huge industrial concern in the 1780s. By the mid-19th century there were several blast furnaces and the production rose from around 500 tons of pig iron per month to 7,000 at the end of the century. The Stanton Ironworks acquired a number of smaller ironstone quarrying and ironworks companies. These included the [[Wellingborough Tramway|Wellingborough Iron Company]] in 1932.<ref name=Quine>{{Quine ironstone |part=3}}</ref>\n\nSteel pipe manufacturing began at Stanton after World War I and later concrete pipes were produced, Stanton being the first in the UK to develop the 'spun pipe' process. \n[[File:Ilkeston Stanton Ironworks Wagon small.jpg|thumbnail|left|A restored Stanton Wagon, Chalons Way, Ilkeston]]\nIn the mid-19th century the works produced 20,000 tons of iron castings per year, 2.5 millions by 1905. Up to 12,500 people were employed during the period when the works were part of British Steel Corporation, of which 7,000 worked at the Stanton works.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Scott-Parker iscottparker@pishtush.com |url=http://www.pishtush.com/camwrangler/z031110.html |title=ODAAT: one day at a time...

It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S&S manhole cover or lamp post.\n\nThe works gradually declined, the business being run from 1985 by the French [[Saint-Gobain]] Group.  The last casting was an emotional event in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=33797 |title=Archived Report - Stanton & Staveley Iron Foundry... the most epic foundry to date - UK Urban Exploration Forums |publisher=28dayslater.co.uk |date=20 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721165015/http://www.28dayslater.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=33797 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The huge Stanton site has been partially given over to business park and the rest of the site is earmarked for redevelopment which is subject to local opposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greensqueeze.org.uk/node/1 |title=fighting to protect the Erewash countryside |publisher=Green Squeeze |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018191912/http://www.greensqueeze.org.uk/node/1 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ilkeston Charter fair==\nIlkeston Market Place is the site of a [[Charter fair]].<ref>[http://www.ilkestonfair.co.uk/ilkfair/ilkfairhist.htm History of Ilkeston Fair] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219100552/http://www.ilkestonfair.co.uk/ilkfair/ilkfairhist.htm |date=19 December 2009 }}</ref> The fair celebrated its 760th anniversary in 2012, the Charter being granted by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1252. This makes the fair older than [[Nottingham]]'s famous [[Nottingham Goose Fair|Goose Fair]] and it is one of the largest street fairs in the Country, indeed in Europe.\n\nThe present fair developed from two separate fairs, as another 'agricultural hiring fair' or 'Statutes Fair' was traditionally held on [[Wakes week]] in October as well as the original Charter Fair which was held on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (15 August). The two fairs were combined in 1888 and the one Charter Fair has been held in October ever since.\n\nSince 1931 the fair has been officially opened by the Mayor - first of Ilkeston and since 1974 of [[Borough of Erewash|Erewash]] - on the Fair Thursday at noon with the Town Clerk (Chief Executive)  reading the Charter from the steps of the Town Hall.\n\n==Transport==\n===Railway===\n\nIlkeston did not have a railway station from 1967 to 2017, despite its substantial population and the fact that the [[Midland Main Line]] (formerly part of the [[Midland Railway]], later the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) skirts the eastern edge of the town. Due to recent rail reopenings in similarly-sized towns it was, by some definitions, one of the largest towns in Britain with no railway station. Ilkeston once had three stations. [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]], also known as \"Ilkeston Junction & Cossall\" was on the former [[Midland Railway]] and later [[London Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Erewash Valley Main Line: this station closed in January 1967. A short branch led from this station to [[Ilkeston Town railway station|Ilkeston Town station]], at the north end of Bath Street, which closed to passengers in June 1947.\n\nIlkeston's third station was [[Ilkeston North railway station|Ilkeston North]], on the former [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (later [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]]) line from Nottingham to [[Derby Friargate railway station|Derby Friargate station]], closed in September 1964.  A major feature of this line was [[Bennerley Viaduct]], a {{convert|1452|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|61|ft|m|adj=on}} high, wrought iron structure which still crosses the Erewash valley just to the north east of Ilkeston.  Once threatened with demolition, it is now a Grade 2 listed building, though the removal of the embankments at either end have left it an oddly isolated free-standing structure surrounded by fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrenceseastwood.co.uk/photo_016.htm|title=Bennerley Viaduct}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a long-running local campaign, in March 2013 Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced that Ilkeston was one of three sites 'most likely' to get a new station as part of the 'New Stations Fund', costing \u00a35 million and sited close to the old [[Ilkeston Junction and Cossall railway station|Ilkeston Junction station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-21948348 |title=BBC News |date=26 March 2013 }}</ref> On the 15 May 2013 it was announced this new station would be built, which would be named [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston station]]. It has two platforms, which can take six trains per hour with up to six passenger cars and includes waiting shelters. A 150 space car park, cycle storage, bus stop, drop off point and taxi rank are also on site. The station is unmanned with automated ticket machines and was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2014.\n\nDue to flood prevention work and the discovery of great crested newts, the opening was significantly delayed.\nThe new station opened on 2 April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402134611/http://www.nottinghampost.com/ilkeston-train-station-finally-opens-but-the-first-train-is-late/story-30244047-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Buses===\n[[TrentBarton]] operate the majority of buses around Ilkeston including the Ilkeston Flyer into Derby, TheTwo and 21 into Nottingham, Black Cat to Mansfield, My15 to Long Eaton and East Midlands Airport <ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/bus-information/route-list}</ref><ref>{https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/userfiles/Ilkeston.pdf}</ref>\n[[Notts + Derby]] and CT4N operate some [[Derbyshire County Council]] tendered routes around Ilkeston.<ref>{http://www.derbysbus.info/places_index/ilkeston.html}</ref>\n\n==Ilkeston spa baths==\nFrom early in the 19th century the existence of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath at the bottom of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel.<ref>History of Ilkeston 1899 page 252</ref> For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity.  'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Derbyshire County Cricket Club]] played one or two [[first-class cricket]] matches per season on the [[Rutland Recreation Ground, Ilkeston|Rutland Recreation Ground]] between 1925 and 1994 and [[List A cricket|one-day matches]] at the ground from 1970 to 1994.\n\nLocal football club [[Ilkeston Town F.C. (1945)|Ilkeston Town]] was liquidated in 2010, after a 114-year history. It was reformed as [[Ilkeston F.C.]] in 2011, which was in turn liquidated in 2017. \nIn July 2017 a new club, [[Ilkeston Town F.C.]] founded by Notts County chairman Alan Hardy, replaced the liquidated Ilkeston FC, and will play at the New Manor Ground in Ilkeston.\n\nLocal rugby club Ilkeston RUFC - known as the \"Elks\" - formed in 1926. The home ground in the town is called The Stute.\n\nThere are also two men basketball teams situated in Ilkeston; the Ilkeston Hawks and Ilkeston Falcons.

His father was a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|Church of England vicar]], and the family lived adjacent to the father's church \u2013 first in [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], then later in [[Ashburton, Victoria|Ashburton]].

The band played at parties and school functions, with a repertoire of [[Lou Reed]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[Sensational Alex Harvey Band]], among others. Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made three studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - Dirty Pearl (1993 ) and Sex O\u2019Clock (200)\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang! Records]] released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] by Harvey's [[retro]] rock band The Wallbangers, called ''Kick the Drugs'' <ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3327901 Discogs - ''Kick the Drugs'' - vinyl 7\", Bang! Records (BANG!-21) Spain]</ref> featuring songs written by Harvey alone, and songs he co-wote with [[Tex Perkins]] and [[Loene Carmen]]. Harvey sings and plays guitars.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook. His next solo record, 2007's ''Two of Diamonds'', was recorded with this group, as was the 2008 live album ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn February 2008, Harvey and Westbrook played as a support act for PJ Harvey on her Australian tour, with both Harveys also performing on stage together. Prior to the tour, Harvey had worked extensively with PJ Harvey over a 12-year period: he was a recording musician on her albums ''[[To Bring You My Love]]'' and ''[[Is This Desire?]]'', and co-produced the album ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melbjuz|title=PJ chooses Mick Harvey|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=10 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173411/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Mickey_Harvey_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey, 2012]]\nIn both 2008 and 2009, he joined the five remaining members of [[The Triffids]] for a series of performances at the [[Sydney Festival]], [[Melbourne Arts Centre]] and [[Perth International Arts Festival]], celebrating the music and the memory of [[David McComb]]. Harvey is also a contributor to the 2009 edited collection, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids'', edited by Australian academics [[Niall Lucy]] and Chris Coughran.<ref>Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds. Vagabond Holes: David McComb and The Triffids (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\nHarvey released ''Sketches from the Book of the Dead'' \u2014 the first solo album written entirely by himself \u2014 in early 2011 on the Mute record label. The 11-track album was recorded in Melbourne, between a Port Melbourne studio and his own Grace Lane music room. Harvey played most of the instruments, while Westbrook played double bass, J.P. Shilo played accordion, violin and occasional guitar, and Xanthe Waite contributed backing vocals. Harvey explained in a promotional interview that he does not perceive himself as a \"songwriter\" in the traditional sense, whereby the practice is: \"something they [actual songwriters, as perceived by Harvey] have done historically and something they've worked on as central to what they are as an artist\". He also confirmed that the opening track, \"October Boy\", is about Rowland S. Howard.<ref name=\"Ian\">{{cite web|author1=Ian Johnston|title=Mick Harvey \u2013 Exclusive LTW Review/Interview|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mick-harvey-exclusive-ltw-reviewinterview/|website=Louder Than War|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarvey once again co-produced and recorded for PJ Harvey during the creation of her eighth studio album, ''[[Let England Shake]]''. The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Rosie Westbrook on double bass and JP Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with [[Brisbane]] writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it. But I've also seen a lot of people, as well, who've used in different ways and not had problems. So the point about banning it across the board is that then you remove that freedom of choice of those people, too. I mean, why does alcohol remain available when other things aren't? It's not a great drug, at all.<ref name=\"Talk\">{{cite web|title='Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs' book launch at Avid Reader, 21 August 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5u_-dvdjM|website=Andrew McMillen on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=28 August 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo albums===\n* ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Two of Diamonds (album)|Two of Diamonds]]'' (2007)\n* ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall'' (2008)\n* ''[[Sketches from the Book of the Dead]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Four (Acts of Love)|Four]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Delirium_Tremens_(Mick_Harvey_Album)|Delirium Tremens]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Intoxicated Women]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War]]'' (2018)\n\n===Film soundtracks===\n* ''The Road To God Knows Where'' & ''Live at the Paradiso'' (1989, together with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds), directed by [[Uli M Schueppel]]\n* ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'' (1990) \n* ''Vaterland'' (1992, together with [[Alexander Hacke]]), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''Alta Marea & Vaterland'' (1993)\n* ''[[To Have & to Hold (film)|To Have & to Hold]]'' (1996) \n* ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'' (2000)\n* ''Planet Alex'' (2000, together with Alexander Hacke), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Suburban Mayhem]]'' (2006) \n* ''Deliver Us from Evil'' (2006)\n* ''Motion Picture Music'' (2006)\n\n===Other CD releases===\n* ''[[And The Ass Saw The Angel]]'' (2000)\n\n===Albums produced for other artists===\n* [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], ''Danger in the Past'' (1990)\n* Once Upon A Time, ''In The Blink of an Eye'' (1992)\n* [[Anita Lane]], ''Dirty Pearl'' (1993)\n* [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]], ''[[The Honeymoon Is Over (album)|The Honeymoon Is Over]]'' (1993) (co-producer) (AUS No. 4, also [[ARIA award]] for \"Best Album\" 1994)\n* [[Congo Norvell]], ''Music To Remember Him By'' (1994)\n* [[PJ Harvey]], ''[[Dance Hall at Louse Point]]'' (1996, co-producer)\n* [[Rowland S.

Harvey was also a member of the school choir (conducted by actor [[Norman Kaye]]), and took extracurricular lessons from [[Bruce Clarke (musician)|Bruce Clarke]], the [[jazz guitar]]ist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|title=Mick Harvey - Biography|website=www.mickharvey.com|accessdate=1 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115181727/http://www.mickharvey.com/biography.php|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Birthday Party===\n{{Main|The Birthday Party (band)}}\nAfter their final school year in 1975, the band decided to continue with Pew as bassist. Greatly influenced by the [[punk rock|punk]] explosion of 1976, which saw Australian bands [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] make their first recordings and tours, [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]], as Harvey's band was now called, began performing fast, original [[New wave music|new wave]] material.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/artist/78466-The-Boys-Next-Door Discogs - ''The Boys Next Door'' - Aliases, Members, Discography]</ref> Harvey's guitar style was influenced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] of [[The Stooges]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] of [[The Jam]]. The Boys Next Door regularly played at Melbourne pubs between 1977 and 1980. [[Rowland S. Howard]] joined the band in 1978, bringing with him a chaotic [[audio feedback|feedback]] guitar style.\n\nAfter extensive touring, recordings, and moderate success in Australia, the Boys Next Door relocated to [[London]], England in 1980, and changed their name to The Birthday Party. Harvey's girlfriend Katy Beale followed the band to London. This period was defined by innovative and aggressive music composition, underpinned by Harvey's guitar playing. The band moved to [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1982, but without Calvert; Harvey transitioned from guitar to drums.\n\n===Crime and the City Solution===\n''Main article: [[Crime & the City Solution]]''\n\nAfter the breakup of The Birthday Party while initiating the early recordings of what would become The Bad Seeds with Nick Cave, Harvey contacted his friend [[Simon Bonney]], with whom he reformed Bonney's old Australian band [[Crime & the City Solution]]. Rowland S. Howard, [[Harry Howard (musician)|Harry Howard]] (bass) and Epic Soundtracks (drums), all of whom a few years later would form the basis of [[These Immortal Souls]], also participated. This line-up of the band found its peak and demise with its appearance in the [[Wim Wenders]] film [[Wings of Desire]]. Bonney then stayed in Berlin and formed the next line-up of the band with his partner [[Bronwyn Adams]], Harvey (drums), [[Alexander Hacke]] of [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]] (guitar), [[Chrislo Haas]] of [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]] and DAF (synthesiser) and Thomas Stern (bass). This line-up made 3 studio albums and toured until 1991.\n\n=== Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds ===\n''Main article: [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]''\n\nHarvey and Cave formed Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds in 1983. Harvey was principally the drummer on the first 2 albums before line-up changes saw him move to the bass until the arrival of [[Martyn P. Casey]] in 1990 when he moved back to his original instrument, guitar. Throughout the 80s and 90 Harvey was the band member charged with the responsibility for the production of the recordings along with Cave. His arrangement skills also saw him putting together most of the band\u2019s string arrangements during this time and led to the perception of him as a kind of musical director. He also managed much of the band\u2019s business affairs right up until his departure. Harvey remained with the Bad Seeds for 25 years until his last show in Perth, Australia on 20 January 2009, when he cited both professional and personal factors as reasons for leaving.<sup>[5]</sup> Regarding Cave, Harvey informed the media: <blockquote>\nI'm confident Nick [Cave] will continue to be a creative force and that this is the right time to pass on my artistic and managerial role to what has become a tremendous group of people who can support him in his endeavours, both musically and organisationally.<ref name=\"Quit\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472215.htm?section=entertainment|title=Bad Seeds co-founder Harvey quits|date=23 January 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2010, Harvey explained further that his frustration with song arrangements strained his relationship with Cave; and a desire to spend time with family was also a significant reason for his decision. The split marked the end of a 36-year-long collaboration between Harvey and Cave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=214|title=Podcast 103 Live interview with Mick Harvey in Paris 2010 : some reasons to have left the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\u2026Part 2 (25\u2032)|author1=Mardi|date=2 March 2010|website=Meltingpod|publisher=Meltingpod|format=Audio file|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== '''Anita Lane''' ===\n''Main article: [[Anita Lane]]''\n\nHarvey worked extensively with Nick Cave\u2019s muse and partner of many years on two albums - Dirty Pearl (1993 ) and Sex O\u2019Clock (200)\n\n===The Wallbangers===\nIn 2007, the Spanish label [[Bang! Records]] released a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] by Harvey's [[retro]] rock band The Wallbangers, called ''Kick the Drugs'' <ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/3327901 Discogs - ''Kick the Drugs'' - vinyl 7\", Bang! Records (BANG!-21) Spain]</ref> featuring songs written by Harvey alone, and songs he co-wote with [[Tex Perkins]] and [[Loene Carmen]]. Harvey sings and plays guitars.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Bonney left Crime & the City Solution for a solo career in the United States, Harvey recorded two solo albums of [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs, translated from French into English: ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995) and ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997). He has also collaborated with UK rock musician [[PJ Harvey]] (no relation), and produced for other Australian artists, including [[Anita Lane]], [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[Conway Savage]] and Rowland S. Howard. Harvey's third solo release, ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'', was issued in September 2005.\n\nHe undertook his first solo tours of Europe and Australia in 2006, accompanied by fellow Bad Seeds [[Thomas Wydler]] and [[James Johnston (English musician)|James Johnston]], as well as Melbourne-based double bassist Rosie Westbrook. His next solo record, 2007's ''Two of Diamonds'', was recorded with this group, as was the 2008 live album ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn February 2008, Harvey and Westbrook played as a support act for PJ Harvey on her Australian tour, with both Harveys also performing on stage together. Prior to the tour, Harvey had worked extensively with PJ Harvey over a 12-year period: he was a recording musician on her albums ''[[To Bring You My Love]]'' and ''[[Is This Desire?]]'', and co-produced the album ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melbjuz|title=PJ chooses Mick Harvey|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|website=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=10 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173411/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/11857/PJ-chooses-Mick-Harvey|archive-date=3 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Mickey_Harvey_2012.jpg|thumb|right|Harvey, 2012]]\nIn both 2008 and 2009, he joined the five remaining members of [[The Triffids]] for a series of performances at the [[Sydney Festival]], [[Melbourne Arts Centre]] and [[Perth International Arts Festival]], celebrating the music and the memory of [[David McComb]]. Harvey is also a contributor to the 2009 edited collection, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids'', edited by Australian academics [[Niall Lucy]] and Chris Coughran.<ref>Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds. Vagabond Holes: David McComb and The Triffids (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nDuring 2008 and 2009 Harvey worked on what would be [[Rowland S. Howard]]\u2019s last album \u2018Pop Crimes\u2019 playing drums with his future close collaborator J.P. Shilo providing bass and violin. The album was released just a few months before Howard succumbed to liver cancer in late 2009.\n\nHarvey released ''Sketches from the Book of the Dead'' \u2014 the first solo album written entirely by himself \u2014 in early 2011 on the Mute record label. The 11-track album was recorded in Melbourne, between a Port Melbourne studio and his own Grace Lane music room. Harvey played most of the instruments, while Westbrook played double bass, J.P. Shilo played accordion, violin and occasional guitar, and Xanthe Waite contributed backing vocals. Harvey explained in a promotional interview that he does not perceive himself as a \"songwriter\" in the traditional sense, whereby the practice is: \"something they [actual songwriters, as perceived by Harvey] have done historically and something they've worked on as central to what they are as an artist\". He also confirmed that the opening track, \"October Boy\", is about Rowland S. Howard.<ref name=\"Ian\">{{cite web|author1=Ian Johnston|title=Mick Harvey \u2013 Exclusive LTW Review/Interview|url=http://louderthanwar.com/mick-harvey-exclusive-ltw-reviewinterview/|website=Louder Than War|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=28 August 2014|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarvey once again co-produced and recorded for PJ Harvey during the creation of her eighth studio album, ''[[Let England Shake]]''. The 2011 release was supported by a world tour in the same year, which also included Harvey as a touring musician.<ref name=\"Ian\" />\n\nHis sixth solo studio album, titled ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'', released on Mute in 2013, features original compositions by Mick Harvey alongside a song by PJ Harvey (\"Glorious\") and interpretations of The Saints\u2019 \"The Story of Love\", [[Van Morrison]]\u2019s \"The Way Young Lovers Do\", Exuma\u2019s \"Summertime in New York\" and [[Roy Orbison]]\u2019s \"Wild Hearts (Run Out of Time)\". ''FOUR (Acts of Love)'' was recorded at Grace Lane, North Melbourne and Atlantis Sound, Melbourne, and features regular collaborators Rosie Westbrook on double bass and JP Shilo on guitar and violin.\n\n''Delirium Tremens'' (2016) is the third instalment in Harvey's project of translating [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s songs into English, after ''Intoxicated Man'' and ''Pink Elephants''. ''Delirium Tremens'' was recorded in Melbourne with Harvey's Antipodean-based core live band. 10 songs were tracked at Birdland Studios; the project then relocated to Berlin, where a further nine songs were recorded with [[Toby Dammit]] ([[The Stooges]], The Residents) and Bertrand Burgalat (of French label Tricatel), who was the string arranger on the first two volumes.\n\nHarvey again collaborated with PJ Harvey in early 2015, playing and singing on her album ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]''. The following year he joined PJ on tour promoting the album, which was released in April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Harvey released the album ''The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War'' in collaboration with author [https://eleganthorrors.co.uk Christopher Richard Barker].\n\n==Personal life==\nHarvey divides his time between Europe and Melbourne. He has one son with his partner, Katy Beale, who is a painter. As of 2014, the family resided in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne.<ref name=\"Talk\" />\n\nAs part of his interview with [[Brisbane]] writer [[Andrew McMillen]] for the book ''Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs'', Harvey concluded with his perspective on illicit drug use:\n\n<blockquote>\nBecause I\u2019ve been so surrounded by [illicit drug use], I've seen a lot of the problems that come with it. But I've also seen a lot of people, as well, who've used in different ways and not had problems. So the point about banning it across the board is that then you remove that freedom of choice of those people, too. I mean, why does alcohol remain available when other things aren't? It's not a great drug, at all.<ref name=\"Talk\">{{cite web|title='Talking Smack: Honest Conversations About Drugs' book launch at Avid Reader, 21 August 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv5u_-dvdjM|website=Andrew McMillen on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=28 August 2014|format=Video upload|date=21 August 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo albums===\n* ''[[Intoxicated Man]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Pink Elephants]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[One Man's Treasure]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Two of Diamonds (album)|Two of Diamonds]]'' (2007)\n* ''Three Sisters \u2013 Live at Bush Hall'' (2008)\n* ''[[Sketches from the Book of the Dead]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Four (Acts of Love)|Four]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Delirium_Tremens_(Mick_Harvey_Album)|Delirium Tremens]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Intoxicated Women]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[The Fall And Rise Of Edgar Bourchier And The Horrors Of War]]'' (2018)\n\n===Film soundtracks===\n* ''The Road To God Knows Where'' & ''Live at the Paradiso'' (1989, together with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds), directed by [[Uli M Schueppel]]\n* ''[[Ghosts... of the Civil Dead]]'' (1990) \n* ''Vaterland'' (1992, together with [[Alexander Hacke]]), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''Alta Marea & Vaterland'' (1993)\n* ''[[To Have & to Hold (film)|To Have & to Hold]]'' (1996) \n* ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'' (2000)\n* ''Planet Alex'' (2000, together with Alexander Hacke), directed by Uli M Schueppel\n* ''[[Australian Rules (film)|Australian Rules]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Suburban Mayhem]]'' (2006) \n* ''Deliver Us from Evil'' (2006)\n* ''Motion Picture Music'' (2006)\n\n===Other CD releases===\n* ''[[And The Ass Saw The Angel]]'' (2000)\n\n===Albums produced for other artists===\n* [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], ''Danger in the Past'' (1990)\n* Once Upon A Time, ''In The Blink of an Eye'' (1992)\n* [[Anita Lane]], ''Dirty Pearl'' (1993)\n* [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]], ''[[The Honeymoon Is Over (album)|The Honeymoon Is Over]]'' (1993) (co-producer) (AUS No. 4, also [[ARIA award]] for \"Best Album\" 1994)\n* [[Congo Norvell]], ''Music To Remember Him By'' (1994)\n* [[PJ Harvey]], ''[[Dance Hall at Louse Point]]'' (1996, co-producer)\n* [[Rowland S.
