[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]] of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]].

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century. Many of the elements underlying India's [[casteism]] and [[communalism (South Asia)|communalism]] originated during the rule of the [[British India|British Raj]], particularly after the late 19th century; the authorities and others often politicized religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Makkar|1993|p=141}}</ref> The [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] (widely known as the Morley-Minto Reforms Act), which established separate Hindu and Muslim electorates for the Imperial Legislature and provincial councils, was particularly divisive. It was blamed for increasing tensions between the two communities.<ref>{{harvnb|Olson|Shadle|1996|p=759}}</ref>\n\nDue to the high degree of oppression faced by the lower castes, the Constitution of India included provisions for [[affirmative action]] for certain sections of Indian society.

Both the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] and the BJP have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The [[Shah Bano case]], a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court's]] decision. After the [[2002 Gujarat violence]], there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics.<ref>{{cite news\n | author = Times News Network\n | title = Togadia wants parties to stop 'vote bank politics'\n | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-03-25/ahmedabad/27127436_1_vhp-leader-togadia-hindus\n | work=indiatimes.com | publisher=Times Internet Limited\n | date=25 March 2002 | accessdate=2007-04-20\n }}</ref>\n\n[[Caste politics in India|Caste-based politics]] is also important in India; caste-based discrimination and the [[Reservation in India|reservation system]] continue to be major issues that are hotly debated.<ref name=\"Chadha_2006\">{{cite news |author=Chadha M |title=Despair of the discriminated Dalits |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6211532.stm |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name=\"Giridharadas_2006\">{{cite news |author=Giridharadas A |title=Turning point in India's caste war |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/21/business/QUOTAS.php |date=22 April 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{POV section |date=July 2016}}\nPolitical parties have been accused of using their political power to manipulate educational content in a [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] manner.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]]. According to the Indian government estimates, the assault caused the deaths of up to 100 soldiers, 250 militants, and hundreds of civilians.<ref name=\"Nichols_2003\">{{cite journal |title=The Politics of Assassination: Case Studies and Analysis |last=Nichols |first=B |journal=Australasian Political Studies Association Conference |year=2003 |url=http://www.utas.edu.au/government/APSA/BNichols.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThis triggered [[Indira Gandhi]]'s assassination by her outraged Sikh bodyguards on 31 October 1984, which set off a four-day period during which Sikhs were massacred; The [[Government of India]] reported 2,700 Sikh deaths however human rights organizations and newspapers report the death toll to be 10,000\u201317,000.

India is officially a [[secular state]] and has no state religion. The [[Indian subcontinent]] is the birthplace of four of the [[Major religious groups|world's major religions]]; namely [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].

[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]] of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]].

The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi, and to [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in Mumbai. [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mount Abu]], [[Palitana]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Girnar]] and [[Shravanabelagola]] are notable pilgrimage sites ([[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]) in Jainism.\n\nThe [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] is the most sacred [[gurdwara]] of Sikhism, while the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship#Delhi, India|Lotus Temple]] in Delhi is a prominent house of worship of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the [[samadhi]] of [[Meher Baba]] in [[Meherabad]], which is visited by his followers from around the world <ref>[http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf \"In His Service: A Newsletter From Meherabad\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073059/http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946.

{"title_page": "Relational algebra", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Relation algebra}}\n{{lead too short|date=April 2015}}\n'''Relational algebra''', first created by [[Edgar F. Codd]] while at IBM, is a family of algebras with a [[well-founded semantics]] used for modelling the data stored in relational databases, and defining queries on it.\n\nThe main application of relational algebra is providing a theoretical foundation for [[relational database]]s, particularly [[query language]]s for such databases, chief among which is [[SQL]].\n\n== Introduction ==\nRelational algebra received little attention outside of pure mathematics until the publication of [[Edgar F. Codd|E.F. Codd]]'s [[relational model|relational model of data]] in 1970. Codd proposed such an algebra as a basis for database query languages. (See section [[#Implementations|Implementations]].)\n\nFive primitive operators of Codd's algebra are the ''[[selection (relational algebra)|selection]]'', the ''[[projection (relational algebra)|projection]]'', the ''[[Cartesian product]]'' (also called the ''cross product'' or ''cross join''), the ''[[set union]]'', and the ''[[set difference]]''.\n\n=== Set operators ===\nThe relational algebra uses [[set union]], [[set difference]], and [[Cartesian product]] from [[set theory]], but adds additional constraints to these operators.\n\nFor set union and set difference, the two [[relation (database)|relation]]s involved must be ''union-compatible''\u2014that is, the two relations must have the same set of attributes.  Because [[set intersection]] is defined in terms of set union and set difference, the two relations involved in set intersection must also be union-compatible.\n\nFor the Cartesian product to be defined, the two relations involved must have disjoint headers\u2014that is, they must not have a common attribute name.\n\nIn addition, the Cartesian product is defined differently from the one in [[Set (mathematics)|set]] theory in the sense that tuples are considered to be \"shallow\" for the purposes of the operation.  That is, the Cartesian product of a set of ''n''-tuples with a set of ''m''-tuples yields a set of \"flattened\" {{math|(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''m'')}}-tuples (whereas basic set theory would have prescribed a set of 2-tuples, each containing an ''n''-tuple and an ''m''-tuple).   More formally, ''R'' \u00d7 ''S'' is defined as follows:\n\n<math>R\\times S:=\\{(r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n,s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_m)|(r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n)\\in R, (s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_m)\\in S\\}</math>\n\nThe cardinality of the Cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities of its factors, that is, |''R'' \u00d7 ''S''| = |''R''| \u00d7 |''S''|.\n\n=== Projection ({{math|&Pi;}}) ===\n{{Main|Projection (relational algebra)}}\nA '''projection''' is a [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\Pi_{a_1, \\ldots,a_n}( R )</math> where <math>a_1,\\ldots,a_n</math> is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is obtained when all [[tuple]]s in ''R'' are restricted to the set <math>\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}</math>.\n\nNote: when implemented in [[SQL]] standard the \"default projection\" returns a [[multiset]] instead of a set, and the {{math|&Pi;}} projection to eliminate duplicate data is obtained by the addition of the [[Select (SQL)|<code>DISTINCT</code> keyword]].\n\n=== Selection (''&sigma;'') ===\n{{Main|Selection (relational algebra)}}\nA '''generalized selection''' is a [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\sigma_\\varphi(R)</math> where {{\u03c6}} is a [[propositional formula]] that consists of [[atomic formula|atom]]s as allowed in the [[selection (relational algebra)|normal selection]] and the logical operators {{and}} ([[logical conjunction|and]]), {{or-}} ([[logical disjunction|or]]) and {{Not}} ([[negation]]). This selection selects all those [[tuple]]s in ''R'' for which {{\u03c6}} holds.\n\nTo obtain a listing of all friends or business associates in an address book, the selection might be written as <math>\\sigma_{\\text{isFriend = true} \\,\\lor\\, \\text{isBusinessContact = true}}( \\text{addressBook} )</math>.  The result would be a relation containing every attribute of every unique record where {{math|size=90%|isFriend}} is true or where {{math|size=90%|isBusinessContact}} is true.\n\n=== Rename (''&rho;'') ===\n{{Main|Rename (relational algebra)}}\nA '''rename''' is a [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\rho_{a / b}(R)</math> where the result is identical to ''R'' except that the ''b'' attribute in all tuples is renamed to an ''a'' attribute.  This is simply used to rename the attribute of a [[relation (database)|relation]] or the relation itself.\n\nTo rename the 'isFriend' attribute to 'isBusinessContact' in a relation, <math>\\rho_{\\text{isBusinessContact / isFriend} } ( \\text{addressBook} )</math> might be used.\n\n== Joins and join-like operators ==\n<!-- insert overview text here... -->\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Natural join}} ({{visible anchor|\u22c8}}) ===\n{{redirect|Natural join|the SQL implementation|Natural join (SQL)}}\nNatural join (\u22c8) is a [[Binary relation|binary operator]] that is written as (''R''  \u22c8 ''S'') where ''R'' and ''S'' are [[relation (database)|relation]]s.<ref>In [[Unicode]], the bowtie symbol is \u22c8 (U+22C8).</ref> The result of the natural join is the set of all combinations of tuples in ''R'' and ''S'' that are equal on their common attribute names. For an example consider the tables ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' and their natural join:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Employee''\n |-\n ! Name   !! EmpId !! DeptName\n |-\n | Harry  || 3415  || Finance\n |-\n | Sally  || 2241  || Sales\n |-\n | George || 3401  || Finance\n |-\n | Harriet || 2202 || Sales\n |-\n | Mary   || 1257 || Human Resources\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Dept''\n |-\n ! DeptName   !! Manager\n |-\n | Finance  || George\n |-\n | Sales  || Harriet\n |-\n | Production || Charles\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+  ''Employee''&nbsp;\u22c8&nbsp;''Dept''\n |-\n ! Name   !! EmpId !!  DeptName   !! Manager\n |-\n | Harry  || 3415   || Finance  || George\n |-\n | Sally  || 2241   || Sales  || Harriet\n |-\n | George || 3401  || Finance || George\n |-\n | Harriet || 2202 || Sales || Harriet\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nNote that neither the employee named Mary nor the Production department appear in the result.\n\nThis can also be used to define [[composition of relations]].  For example, the composition of ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' is their join as shown above, projected on all but the common attribute ''DeptName''.  In [[category theory]], the join is precisely the [[fiber product]].\n\nThe natural join is arguably one of the most important operators since it is the relational counterpart of logical AND operator. Note that if the same  variable appears in each of two predicates that are connected by AND, then that variable stands for the same thing and both appearances must always be substituted by the same value (this is a consequence of the [[idempotence]] of the logical AND). In particular, natural join allows the combination of relations that are associated by a [[foreign key]]. For example, in the above example a foreign key probably holds from ''Employee''.''DeptName'' to ''Dept''.''DeptName'' and then the natural join of ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' combines all employees with their departments. This works because the foreign key holds between attributes with the same name. If this is not the case such as in the foreign key from ''Dept''.''Manager'' to ''Employee''.''Name'' then we have to rename these columns before we take the natural join. Such a join is sometimes also referred to as an '''equijoin''' (see ''\u03b8''-join).\n\nMore formally the semantics of the natural join are defined as follows:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>R \\bowtie S = \\left\\{ r \\cup s \\ \\vert \\ r \\in R \\ \\land \\ s \\in S \\ \\land \\ \\mathit{Fun}(r \\cup s) \\right\\}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere ''Fun(t)'' is a [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] that is true for a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] ''t'' (in the mathematical sense) [[iff]] ''t'' is a function. It is usually required that ''R'' and ''S'' must have at least one common attribute, but if this constraint is omitted, and ''R'' and ''S'' have no common attributes, then the natural join becomes exactly the Cartesian product.\n\nThe natural join can be simulated with Codd's primitives as follows. Assume that ''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''m''</sub> are the attribute names common to ''R'' and ''S'', ''r''<sub>1</sub>,...,''r''<sub>''n''</sub> are the\nattribute names unique to ''R'' and ''s''<sub>1</sub>,...,''s''<sub>''k''</sub> are the\nattribute names unique to ''S''. Furthermore, assume that the attribute names  ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''m''</sub> are neither in ''R'' nor in ''S''. In a first step we can now rename the common attribute names in ''S'':\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T = \\rho_{x_1/c_1,\\ldots,x_m/c_m}(S) = \\rho_{x_1/c_1}(\\rho_{x_2/c_2}(\\ldots\\rho_{x_m/c_m}(S)\\ldots))</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nThen we take the Cartesian product and select the tuples that are to be joined:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>P = \\sigma_{c_1=x_1,\\ldots,c_m=x_m}(R \\times T) = \\sigma_{c_1=x_1}(\\sigma_{c_2=x_2}(\\ldots\\sigma_{c_m=x_m}(R \\times T)\\ldots))</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nFinally we take a projection to get rid of the renamed attributes:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>U = \\Pi_{r_1,\\ldots,r_n,c_1,\\ldots,c_m,s_1,\\ldots,s_k}(P)</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\n=== ''\u03b8''-join and equijoin ===\nConsider tables ''Car'' and ''Boat'' which list models of cars and boats and their respective prices. Suppose a customer wants to buy a car and a boat, but she does not want to spend more money for the boat than for the car. The ''\u03b8''-join (\u22c8<sub>''\u03b8''</sub>) on the predicate ''CarPrice'' \u2265 ''BoatPrice'' produces the flattened pairs of rows which satisfy the predicate. When using a condition where the attributes are equal, for example Price, then the condition may be specified as ''Price''=''Price''\nor alternatively (''Price'') itself.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Car''\n |-\n ! CarModel   !! CarPrice\n |-\n | CarA  || 20,000\n |-\n | CarB  || 30,000\n |-\n | CarC  || 50,000\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Boat''\n |-\n ! BoatModel   !!

The ''\u03b8''-join is a binary operator that is written as <math>{R\\ \\bowtie\\ S \\atop a\\ \\theta\\ b}</math> or <math>{R\\ \\bowtie\\ S \\atop a\\ \\theta\\ v}</math> where ''a'' and ''b'' are attribute names, ''\u03b8'' is a binary [[relational operator]] in the set <span class=\"texhtml\">{&lt;, \u2264, =, \u2260, &gt;, \u2265}</span>, ''\u03c5'' is a value constant, and ''R'' and ''S'' are relations.  The result of this operation consists of all combinations of tuples in ''R'' and ''S'' that satisfy ''\u03b8''.  The result of the ''\u03b8''-join is defined only if the headers of ''S'' and ''R'' are disjoint, that is, do not contain a common attribute.\n\nThe simulation of this operation in the fundamental operations is therefore as follows:\n: ''R''  \u22c8<sub>''\u03b8''</sub> ''S'' = ''\u03c3<sub>\u03b8</sub>''(''R'' \u00d7 ''S'')\n\nIn case the operator ''\u03b8'' is the equality operator (=) then this join is also called an '''equijoin'''.\n\nNote, however, that a computer language that supports the natural join and selection operators does not need ''\u03b8''-join as well, as this can be achieved by selection from the result of a natural join (which degenerates to Cartesian product when there are no shared attributes).\n\nIn SQL implementations, joining on a predicate is usually called an ''inner join'', and the ''on'' keyword allows one to specify the predicate used to filter the rows. It is important to note: forming the flattened Cartesian product then filtering the rows is conceptually correct, but an implementation would use more sophisticated data structures to speed up the join query.\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Semijoin}} (\u22c9)(\u22ca) ===\n\nThe left semijoin is a joining similar to the natural join and written as ''R''\n\u22c9 ''S'' where ''R'' and ''S'' are [[relation (database)|relation]]s.<ref>In [[Unicode]], the ltimes symbol is \u22c9 (U+22C9). The rtimes symbol is \u22ca (U+22CA)</ref> The result is the set of all tuples in ''R'' for which there is a tuple in ''S'' that is equal on their common attribute names. The difference from a natural join is that other columns of ''S'' do not appear. For example, consider the tables ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' and their semijoin:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Employee''\n |-\n !

Division is not implemented directly in SQL. The result consists of the restrictions of tuples in ''R'' to the attribute names unique to ''R'', i.e., in the header of ''R'' but not in the header of ''S'', for which it holds that all their combinations with tuples in ''S'' are present in ''R''. For an example see the tables ''Completed'', ''DBProject'' and their division:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ ''Completed''\n |-\n !

Student\n |-\n | Fred\n |-\n | Sarah\n|}\n{{col-end}}If ''DBProject'' contains all the tasks of the Database project, then the result of the division above contains exactly the students who have completed both of the tasks in the Database project.\n\nMore formally the semantics of the division is defined as follows:{{NumBlk|:| {{math|''R'' \u00f7 ''S'' {{=}} { ''t''[''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] : ''t'' \u2208 ''R'' \u2227 \u2200''s'' \u2208 ''S'' ( (''t''[''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] \u222a ''s'') \u2208 ''R'') } }} |{{EquationRef|6}}}}where {''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>} is the set of attribute names unique to ''R'' and ''t''[''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] is the restriction of ''t'' to this set. It is usually required that the attribute names in the header of ''S'' are a subset of those of ''R'' because otherwise the result of the operation will always be empty.\n\nThe simulation of the division with the basic operations is as follows. We assume that ''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are the attribute names unique to ''R'' and ''b''<sub>1</sub>,...,''b''<sub>''m''</sub> are the attribute names of ''S''. In the first step we project ''R'' on its unique attribute names and construct all combinations with tuples in ''S'':\n: ''T'' := \u03c0<sub>''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub></sub>(''R'') \u00d7 ''S''\n\nIn the prior example, T would represent a table such that every Student (because Student is the unique key / attribute of the Completed table) is combined with every given Task. So Eugene, for instance, would have two rows, Eugene &rarr; Database1 and Eugene &rarr; Database2 in T.\n\n:: EG: First, let's pretend that \"Completed\" has a third attribute called \"grade\".  It's unwanted baggage here, so we must project it off always. In fact in this step we can drop 'Task' from R as well; the multiply puts it back on.\n:: ''T'' := \u03c0<sub>Student</sub>(''R'') \u00d7 ''S''  // This gives us every possible desired combination, including those that don't actually exist in R, and excluding others (eg Fred | compiler1, which is not a desired combination){{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}{{col-break|gap=5em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ ''T''\n |-\n !

For example, it is not possible using only the algebra introduced so far to write an expression that would multiply the numbers from two columns, e.g. a unit price with a quantity to obtain a total price. Practical query languages have such facilities, e.g. the SQL SELECT allows arithmetic operations to define new columns in the result <source lang=\"sql\" inline>SELECT unit_price * quantity AS total_price FROM t</source>, and a similar facility is provided more explicitly by [[Tutorial D]]'s <code>EXTEND</code> keyword.<ref name=\"Date2011\">{{cite book|author=C. J. Date|title=SQL and Relational Theory: How to Write Accurate SQL Code|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuZGD5tBfMwC&pg=PA133|year=2011|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-1974-8|pages=133\u2013135}}</ref> In database theory, this is called '''extended projection'''.<ref name=\"Garcia-MolinaUllman2009\"/>{{rp|213}}\n\n==== Aggregation ====\nFurthermore, computing various functions on a column, like the summing up of its elements, is also not possible using the relational algebra introduced so far. There are five [[aggregate function]]s that are included with most relational database systems. These operations are Sum, Count, Average, Maximum and Minimum. In relational algebra the aggregation operation over a schema (''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>) is written as follows:\n\n:<math>G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_m\\ g_{f_1({A_1}'), f_2({A_2}'), \\ldots, f_k({A_k}')}\\ (r)</math>\n\nwhere each ''A''<sub>''j''</sub>', 1 \u2264 ''j'' \u2264 ''k'', is one of the original attributes ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''.\n\nThe attributes preceding the ''g'' are grouping attributes, which function like a \"group by\" clause in SQL. Then there are an arbitrary number of aggregation functions applied to individual attributes. The operation is applied to an arbitrary relation ''r''. The grouping attributes are optional, and if they are not supplied, the aggregation functions are applied across the entire relation to which the operation is applied.\n\nLet's assume that we have a table named {{mono|Account}} with three columns, namely {{mono|Account_Number, Branch_Name}} and {{mono|Balance}}. We wish to find the maximum balance of each branch. This is accomplished by <sub>{{mono|Branch_Name}}</sub>''G''<sub>Max({{mono|Balance}})</sub>({{mono|Account}}). To find the highest balance of all accounts regardless of branch, we could simply write ''G''<sub>Max({{mono|Balance}})</sub>({{mono|Account}}).\n\n=== Transitive closure ===\nAlthough relational algebra seems powerful enough for most practical purposes, there are some simple and natural operators on [[relation (database)|relation]]s that cannot be expressed by relational algebra. One of them is the [[transitive closure]] of a binary relation. Given a domain ''D'', let binary relation ''R'' be a subset of ''D''&times;''D''. The transitive closure ''R<sup>+</sup>'' of ''R'' is the smallest subset of ''D''&times;''D'' that contains ''R'' and satisfies the following condition:\n\n:<math>\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z \\left( (x,y) \\in R^+ \\wedge (y,z) \\in R^+ \\Rightarrow (x,z) \\in R^+ \\right)</math>\n\nThere is no relational algebra expression ''E''(''R'') taking ''R'' as a variable argument that produces ''R''<sup>+</sup>. This can be proved using the fact that, given a relational expression ''E'' for which it is claimed that ''E''(''R'') = ''R''<sup>+</sup>, where ''R'' is a variable, we can always find an instance '''''r''''' of ''R'' (and a corresponding domain '''d''') such that ''E''('''''r''''') \u2260 '''''r'''''<sup>+</sup>.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Universality of data retrieval languages|journal=Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|year=1979|first=Alfred V.|last=Aho|author2=Jeffrey D.

Our secondary goal is to try to form common subexpressions within a single query, or if there is more than one query being evaluated at the same time, in all of those queries. The rationale behind the second goal is that it is enough to compute common subexpressions once, and the results can be used in all queries that contain that subexpression.\n\nHere we present a set of rules that can be used in such transformations.\n\n=== Selection ===\n\nRules about selection operators play the most important role in query optimization. Selection is an operator that very effectively decreases the number of rows in its operand, so if we manage to move the selections in an expression tree towards the leaves, the internal [[relation (database)|relation]]s (yielded by subexpressions) will likely shrink.\n\n==== Basic selection properties ====\n\nSelection is [[idempotent]] (multiple applications of the same selection have no additional effect beyond the first one), and [[commutative]] (the order selections are applied in has no effect on the eventual result).\n\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R)=\\sigma_{A}\\sigma_{A}(R)\\,\\!</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}\\sigma_{B}(R)=\\sigma_{B}\\sigma_{A}(R)\\,\\!</math>\n\n==== Breaking up selections with complex conditions ====\n\nA selection whose condition is a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of simpler conditions is equivalent to a sequence of selections with those same individual conditions, and selection whose condition is a [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] is equivalent to a union of selections.  These identities can be used to merge selections so that fewer selections need to be evaluated, or to split them so that the component selections may be moved or optimized separately.\n\n#<math>\\sigma_{A \\land B}(R)=\\sigma_{A}(\\sigma_{B}(R))=\\sigma_{B}(\\sigma_{A}(R))</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A \\lor B}(R)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cup\\sigma_{B}(R)</math>\n\n==== Selection and cross product ====\nCross product is the costliest operator to evaluate. If the input [[relation (database)|relation]]s have ''N'' and ''M'' rows, the result will contain <math>NM</math> rows. Therefore, it is very important to do our best to decrease the size of both operands before applying the cross product operator.\n\nThis can be effectively done if the cross product is followed by a selection operator, e.g. <math>\\sigma_{A}(R \\times P)</math>. Considering the definition of join, this is the most likely case. If the cross product is not followed by a selection operator, we can try to push down a selection from higher levels of the expression tree using the other selection rules.\n\nIn the above case we break up condition ''A'' into conditions ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' using the split rules about complex selection conditions, so that <math>A = B \\wedge C \\wedge D</math> and ''B'' contains attributes only from ''R'', ''C'' contains attributes only from ''P'', and ''D'' contains the part of ''A'' that contains attributes from both ''R'' and ''P''. Note, that ''B'', ''C'' or ''D'' are possibly empty. Then the following holds:\n:<math>\\sigma_{A}(R \\times P) = \\sigma_{B \\wedge C \\wedge D}(R \\times P) = \\sigma_{D}(\\sigma_{B}(R) \\times \\sigma_{C}(P))</math>\n\n==== Selection and set operators ====\nSelection is [[distributive property|distributive]] over the set difference, intersection, and union operators.  The following three rules are used to push selection below set operations in the expression tree. For the set difference and the intersection operators, it is possible to apply the selection operator to just one of the operands following the transformation. This can be beneficial where one of the operands is small, and the overhead of evaluating the selection operator outweighs the benefits of using a smaller [[relation (database)|relation]] as an operand.\n\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R\\setminus P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\setminus \\sigma_{A}(P) =\\sigma_{A}(R)\\setminus P</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R\\cup P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cup\\sigma_{A}(P)</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R\\cap P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cap\\sigma_{A}(P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cap P=R\\cap \\sigma_{A}(P)</math>\n\n==== Selection and projection ====\n\nSelection commutes with projection if and only if the fields referenced in the selection condition are a subset of the fields in the projection.  Performing selection before projection may be useful if the operand is a cross product or join.  In other cases, if the selection condition is relatively expensive to compute, moving selection outside the projection may reduce the number of tuples which must be tested (since projection may produce fewer tuples due to the elimination of duplicates resulting from omitted fields).\n\n:<math>\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots ,a_n}(\\sigma_A( R )) = \\sigma_A(\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots,a_n}( R ))\\text{ where fields in }A \\subseteq \\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}</math>\n\n=== Projection ===\n\n==== Basic projection properties ====\n\nProjection is idempotent, so that a series of (valid) projections is equivalent to the outermost projection.\n\n:<math>\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots , a_n}(\\pi_{b_1,\\ldots , b_m}(R)) = \\pi_{a_1, \\ldots , a_n}(R)\\text{ where }\\{a_1, \\ldots , a_n\\} \\subseteq \\{b_1, \\ldots , b_m\\}</math>\n\n==== Projection and set operators ====\n\nProjection is [[distributive property|distributive]] over set union.\n\n:<math>\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}(R \\cup P) = \\pi_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}(R) \\cup \\pi_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}(P). \\, </math>\n\nProjection does not distribute over intersection and set difference. Counterexamples are given by:\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\} \\cap \\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\emptyset</math>\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\}) \\cap \\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\{ \\langle A=a \\rangle \\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\} \\setminus \\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\{ \\langle A=a\\rangle \\}</math>\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\}) \\setminus \\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\emptyset\\,,</math>\nwhere ''b'' is assumed to be distinct from {{var|b'}}.\n\n=== Rename ===\n\n==== Basic rename properties ====\n\nSuccessive renames of a variable can be collapsed into a single rename.  Rename operations which have no variables in common can be arbitrarily reordered with respect to one another, which can be exploited to make successive renames adjacent so that they can be collapsed.\n\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(\\rho_{b / c}(R)) = \\rho_{a / c}(R)\\,\\!</math>\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(\\rho_{c / d}(R)) = \\rho_{c / d}(\\rho_{a / b}(R))\\,\\!</math>\n\n==== Rename and set operators ====\n\nRename is distributive over set difference, union, and intersection.\n\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(R \\setminus P) = \\rho_{a / b}(R) \\setminus \\rho_{a / b}(P)</math>\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(R \\cup P) = \\rho_{a / b}(R) \\cup \\rho_{a / b}(P)</math>\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(R \\cap P) = \\rho_{a / b}(R) \\cap \\rho_{a / b}(P)</math>\n\n=== Product and union ===\n\nCartesian product is distributive over union.\n\n#<math>(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) = A \\times (B \\cup C)</math>\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nThe first query language to be based on Codd's algebra was Alpha, developed by Dr. Codd himself. Subsequently, [[ISBL]] was created, and this pioneering work has been acclaimed by many authorities [http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/codd_1000892.cfm] as having shown the way to make Codd's idea into a useful language. [[Business System 12]] was a short-lived industry-strength relational DBMS that followed the ISBL example.\n\nIn 1998 [[Christopher J. Date|Chris Date]] and [[Hugh Darwen]] proposed a language called '''[[Tutorial D]]''' intended for use in teaching relational database theory, and its query language also draws on ISBL's ideas. [[Rel (DBMS)|Rel]] is an implementation of '''Tutorial D'''.\n\nEven the query language of [[SQL]] is loosely based on a relational algebra, though the operands in SQL ([[table (database)|table]]s) are not exactly [[relation (database)|relation]]s and several useful theorems about the relational algebra do not hold in the SQL counterpart (arguably to the detriment of optimisers and/or users). The SQL table model is a bag ([[multiset]]), rather than a set. For example, the expression <math>(R \\cup S) \\setminus T = (R \\setminus T) \\cup (S \\setminus T)</math> is a theorem for relational algebra on sets, but not for relational algebra on bags; for a treatment of relational algebra on bags see chapter 5 of the \"Complete\" textbook by [[Garcia-Molina]], [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] and [[Jennifer Widom|Widom]].<ref name=\"Garcia-MolinaUllman2009\">{{cite book|author1=Hector Garcia-Molina|author2=Jeffrey D.

Codd]] while at IBM, is a family of algebras with a [[well-founded semantics]] used for modelling the data stored in relational databases, and defining queries on it.\n\nThe main application of relational algebra is providing a theoretical foundation for [[relational database]]s, particularly [[query language]]s for such databases, chief among which is [[SQL]].\n\n== Introduction ==\nRelational algebra received little attention outside of pure mathematics until the publication of [[Edgar F. Codd|E.F. Codd]]'s [[relational model|relational model of data]] in 1970. Codd proposed such an algebra as a basis for database query languages. (See section [[#Implementations|Implementations]].)\n\nFive primitive operators of Codd's algebra are the ''[[selection (relational algebra)|selection]]'', the ''[[projection (relational algebra)|projection]]'', the ''[[Cartesian product]]'' (also called the ''cross product'' or ''cross join''), the ''[[set union]]'', and the ''[[set difference]]''.\n\n=== Set operators ===\nThe relational algebra uses [[set union]], [[set difference]], and [[Cartesian product]] from [[set theory]], but adds additional constraints to these operators.\n\nFor set union and set difference, the two [[relation (database)|relation]]s involved must be ''union-compatible''\u2014that is, the two relations must have the same set of attributes.  Because [[set intersection]] is defined in terms of set union and set difference, the two relations involved in set intersection must also be union-compatible.\n\nFor the Cartesian product to be defined, the two relations involved must have disjoint headers\u2014that is, they must not have a common attribute name.\n\nIn addition, the Cartesian product is defined differently from the one in [[Set (mathematics)|set]] theory in the sense that tuples are considered to be \"shallow\" for the purposes of the operation.  That is, the Cartesian product of a set of ''n''-tuples with a set of ''m''-tuples yields a set of \"flattened\" {{math|(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''m'')}}-tuples (whereas basic set theory would have prescribed a set of 2-tuples, each containing an ''n''-tuple and an ''m''-tuple).   More formally, ''R'' \u00d7 ''S'' is defined as follows:\n\n<math>R\\times S:=\\{(r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n,s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_m)|(r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n)\\in R, (s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_m)\\in S\\}</math>\n\nThe cardinality of the Cartesian product is the product of the cardinalities of its factors, that is, |''R'' \u00d7 ''S''| = |''R''| \u00d7 |''S''|.\n\n=== Projection ({{math|&Pi;}}) ===\n{{Main|Projection (relational algebra)}}\nA '''projection''' is a [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\Pi_{a_1, \\ldots,a_n}( R )</math> where <math>a_1,\\ldots,a_n</math> is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is obtained when all [[tuple]]s in ''R'' are restricted to the set <math>\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}</math>.\n\nNote: when implemented in [[SQL]] standard the \"default projection\" returns a [[multiset]] instead of a set, and the {{math|&Pi;}} projection to eliminate duplicate data is obtained by the addition of the [[Select (SQL)|<code>DISTINCT</code> keyword]].\n\n=== Selection (''&sigma;'') ===\n{{Main|Selection (relational algebra)}}\nA '''generalized selection''' is a [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\sigma_\\varphi(R)</math> where {{\u03c6}} is a [[propositional formula]] that consists of [[atomic formula|atom]]s as allowed in the [[selection (relational algebra)|normal selection]] and the logical operators {{and}} ([[logical conjunction|and]]), {{or-}} ([[logical disjunction|or]]) and {{Not}} ([[negation]]). This selection selects all those [[tuple]]s in ''R'' for which {{\u03c6}} holds.\n\nTo obtain a listing of all friends or business associates in an address book, the selection might be written as <math>\\sigma_{\\text{isFriend = true} \\,\\lor\\, \\text{isBusinessContact = true}}( \\text{addressBook} )</math>.  The result would be a relation containing every attribute of every unique record where {{math|size=90%|isFriend}} is true or where {{math|size=90%|isBusinessContact}} is true.\n\n=== Rename (''&rho;'') ===\n{{Main|Rename (relational algebra)}}\nA '''rename''' is a [[unary operation]] written as <math>\\rho_{a / b}(R)</math> where the result is identical to ''R'' except that the ''b'' attribute in all tuples is renamed to an ''a'' attribute.  This is simply used to rename the attribute of a [[relation (database)|relation]] or the relation itself.\n\nTo rename the 'isFriend' attribute to 'isBusinessContact' in a relation, <math>\\rho_{\\text{isBusinessContact / isFriend} } ( \\text{addressBook} )</math> might be used.\n\n== Joins and join-like operators ==\n<!-- insert overview text here... -->\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Natural join}} ({{visible anchor|\u22c8}}) ===\n{{redirect|Natural join|the SQL implementation|Natural join (SQL)}}\nNatural join (\u22c8) is a [[Binary relation|binary operator]] that is written as (''R''  \u22c8 ''S'') where ''R'' and ''S'' are [[relation (database)|relation]]s.<ref>In [[Unicode]], the bowtie symbol is \u22c8 (U+22C8).</ref> The result of the natural join is the set of all combinations of tuples in ''R'' and ''S'' that are equal on their common attribute names. For an example consider the tables ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' and their natural join:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Employee''\n |-\n ! Name   !! EmpId !! DeptName\n |-\n | Harry  || 3415  || Finance\n |-\n | Sally  || 2241  || Sales\n |-\n | George || 3401  || Finance\n |-\n | Harriet || 2202 || Sales\n |-\n | Mary   || 1257 || Human Resources\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Dept''\n |-\n ! DeptName   !! Manager\n |-\n | Finance  || George\n |-\n | Sales  || Harriet\n |-\n | Production || Charles\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+  ''Employee''&nbsp;\u22c8&nbsp;''Dept''\n |-\n ! Name   !! EmpId !!  DeptName   !! Manager\n |-\n | Harry  || 3415   || Finance  || George\n |-\n | Sally  || 2241   || Sales  || Harriet\n |-\n | George || 3401  || Finance || George\n |-\n | Harriet || 2202 || Sales || Harriet\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nNote that neither the employee named Mary nor the Production department appear in the result.\n\nThis can also be used to define [[composition of relations]].  For example, the composition of ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' is their join as shown above, projected on all but the common attribute ''DeptName''.  In [[category theory]], the join is precisely the [[fiber product]].\n\nThe natural join is arguably one of the most important operators since it is the relational counterpart of logical AND operator. Note that if the same  variable appears in each of two predicates that are connected by AND, then that variable stands for the same thing and both appearances must always be substituted by the same value (this is a consequence of the [[idempotence]] of the logical AND). In particular, natural join allows the combination of relations that are associated by a [[foreign key]]. For example, in the above example a foreign key probably holds from ''Employee''.''DeptName'' to ''Dept''.''DeptName'' and then the natural join of ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' combines all employees with their departments. This works because the foreign key holds between attributes with the same name. If this is not the case such as in the foreign key from ''Dept''.''Manager'' to ''Employee''.''Name'' then we have to rename these columns before we take the natural join. Such a join is sometimes also referred to as an '''equijoin''' (see ''\u03b8''-join).\n\nMore formally the semantics of the natural join are defined as follows:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>R \\bowtie S = \\left\\{ r \\cup s \\ \\vert \\ r \\in R \\ \\land \\ s \\in S \\ \\land \\ \\mathit{Fun}(r \\cup s) \\right\\}</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere ''Fun(t)'' is a [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] that is true for a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] ''t'' (in the mathematical sense) [[iff]] ''t'' is a function. It is usually required that ''R'' and ''S'' must have at least one common attribute, but if this constraint is omitted, and ''R'' and ''S'' have no common attributes, then the natural join becomes exactly the Cartesian product.\n\nThe natural join can be simulated with Codd's primitives as follows. Assume that ''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''m''</sub> are the attribute names common to ''R'' and ''S'', ''r''<sub>1</sub>,...,''r''<sub>''n''</sub> are the\nattribute names unique to ''R'' and ''s''<sub>1</sub>,...,''s''<sub>''k''</sub> are the\nattribute names unique to ''S''. Furthermore, assume that the attribute names  ''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''m''</sub> are neither in ''R'' nor in ''S''. In a first step we can now rename the common attribute names in ''S'':\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>T = \\rho_{x_1/c_1,\\ldots,x_m/c_m}(S) = \\rho_{x_1/c_1}(\\rho_{x_2/c_2}(\\ldots\\rho_{x_m/c_m}(S)\\ldots))</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nThen we take the Cartesian product and select the tuples that are to be joined:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>P = \\sigma_{c_1=x_1,\\ldots,c_m=x_m}(R \\times T) = \\sigma_{c_1=x_1}(\\sigma_{c_2=x_2}(\\ldots\\sigma_{c_m=x_m}(R \\times T)\\ldots))</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nFinally we take a projection to get rid of the renamed attributes:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>U = \\Pi_{r_1,\\ldots,r_n,c_1,\\ldots,c_m,s_1,\\ldots,s_k}(P)</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\n=== ''\u03b8''-join and equijoin ===\nConsider tables ''Car'' and ''Boat'' which list models of cars and boats and their respective prices. Suppose a customer wants to buy a car and a boat, but she does not want to spend more money for the boat than for the car. The ''\u03b8''-join (\u22c8<sub>''\u03b8''</sub>) on the predicate ''CarPrice'' \u2265 ''BoatPrice'' produces the flattened pairs of rows which satisfy the predicate. When using a condition where the attributes are equal, for example Price, then the condition may be specified as ''Price''=''Price''\nor alternatively (''Price'') itself.\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Car''\n |-\n !

The ''\u03b8''-join is a binary operator that is written as <math>{R\\ \\bowtie\\ S \\atop a\\ \\theta\\ b}</math> or <math>{R\\ \\bowtie\\ S \\atop a\\ \\theta\\ v}</math> where ''a'' and ''b'' are attribute names, ''\u03b8'' is a binary [[relational operator]] in the set <span class=\"texhtml\">{&lt;, \u2264, =, \u2260, &gt;, \u2265}</span>, ''\u03c5'' is a value constant, and ''R'' and ''S'' are relations.  The result of this operation consists of all combinations of tuples in ''R'' and ''S'' that satisfy ''\u03b8''.  The result of the ''\u03b8''-join is defined only if the headers of ''S'' and ''R'' are disjoint, that is, do not contain a common attribute.\n\nThe simulation of this operation in the fundamental operations is therefore as follows:\n: ''R''  \u22c8<sub>''\u03b8''</sub> ''S'' = ''\u03c3<sub>\u03b8</sub>''(''R'' \u00d7 ''S'')\n\nIn case the operator ''\u03b8'' is the equality operator (=) then this join is also called an '''equijoin'''.\n\nNote, however, that a computer language that supports the natural join and selection operators does not need ''\u03b8''-join as well, as this can be achieved by selection from the result of a natural join (which degenerates to Cartesian product when there are no shared attributes).\n\nIn SQL implementations, joining on a predicate is usually called an ''inner join'', and the ''on'' keyword allows one to specify the predicate used to filter the rows. It is important to note: forming the flattened Cartesian product then filtering the rows is conceptually correct, but an implementation would use more sophisticated data structures to speed up the join query.\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Semijoin}} (\u22c9)(\u22ca) ===\n\nThe left semijoin is a joining similar to the natural join and written as ''R''\n\u22c9 ''S'' where ''R'' and ''S'' are [[relation (database)|relation]]s.<ref>In [[Unicode]], the ltimes symbol is \u22c9 (U+22C9). The rtimes symbol is \u22ca (U+22CA)</ref> The result is the set of all tuples in ''R'' for which there is a tuple in ''S'' that is equal on their common attribute names. The difference from a natural join is that other columns of ''S'' do not appear. For example, consider the tables ''Employee'' and ''Dept'' and their semijoin:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+           ''Employee''\n |-\n !

Division is not implemented directly in SQL. The result consists of the restrictions of tuples in ''R'' to the attribute names unique to ''R'', i.e., in the header of ''R'' but not in the header of ''S'', for which it holds that all their combinations with tuples in ''S'' are present in ''R''. For an example see the tables ''Completed'', ''DBProject'' and their division:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ ''Completed''\n |-\n !

Student\n |-\n | Fred\n |-\n | Sarah\n|}\n{{col-end}}If ''DBProject'' contains all the tasks of the Database project, then the result of the division above contains exactly the students who have completed both of the tasks in the Database project.\n\nMore formally the semantics of the division is defined as follows:{{NumBlk|:| {{math|''R'' \u00f7 ''S'' {{=}} { ''t''[''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] : ''t'' \u2208 ''R'' \u2227 \u2200''s'' \u2208 ''S'' ( (''t''[''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] \u222a ''s'') \u2208 ''R'') } }} |{{EquationRef|6}}}}where {''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>} is the set of attribute names unique to ''R'' and ''t''[''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>] is the restriction of ''t'' to this set. It is usually required that the attribute names in the header of ''S'' are a subset of those of ''R'' because otherwise the result of the operation will always be empty.\n\nThe simulation of the division with the basic operations is as follows. We assume that ''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are the attribute names unique to ''R'' and ''b''<sub>1</sub>,...,''b''<sub>''m''</sub> are the attribute names of ''S''. In the first step we project ''R'' on its unique attribute names and construct all combinations with tuples in ''S'':\n: ''T'' := \u03c0<sub>''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub></sub>(''R'') \u00d7 ''S''\n\nIn the prior example, T would represent a table such that every Student (because Student is the unique key / attribute of the Completed table) is combined with every given Task. So Eugene, for instance, would have two rows, Eugene &rarr; Database1 and Eugene &rarr; Database2 in T.\n\n:: EG: First, let's pretend that \"Completed\" has a third attribute called \"grade\".  It's unwanted baggage here, so we must project it off always. In fact in this step we can drop 'Task' from R as well; the multiply puts it back on.\n:: ''T'' := \u03c0<sub>Student</sub>(''R'') \u00d7 ''S''  // This gives us every possible desired combination, including those that don't actually exist in R, and excluding others (eg Fred | compiler1, which is not a desired combination){{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0.5em auto}}{{col-break|gap=5em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n |+ ''T''\n |-\n !

For example, it is not possible using only the algebra introduced so far to write an expression that would multiply the numbers from two columns, e.g. a unit price with a quantity to obtain a total price. Practical query languages have such facilities, e.g. the SQL SELECT allows arithmetic operations to define new columns in the result <source lang=\"sql\" inline>SELECT unit_price * quantity AS total_price FROM t</source>, and a similar facility is provided more explicitly by [[Tutorial D]]'s <code>EXTEND</code> keyword.<ref name=\"Date2011\">{{cite book|author=C. J.

There are five [[aggregate function]]s that are included with most relational database systems. These operations are Sum, Count, Average, Maximum and Minimum. In relational algebra the aggregation operation over a schema (''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>) is written as follows:\n\n:<math>G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_m\\ g_{f_1({A_1}'), f_2({A_2}'), \\ldots, f_k({A_k}')}\\ (r)</math>\n\nwhere each ''A''<sub>''j''</sub>', 1 \u2264 ''j'' \u2264 ''k'', is one of the original attributes ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''.\n\nThe attributes preceding the ''g'' are grouping attributes, which function like a \"group by\" clause in SQL. Then there are an arbitrary number of aggregation functions applied to individual attributes. The operation is applied to an arbitrary relation ''r''. The grouping attributes are optional, and if they are not supplied, the aggregation functions are applied across the entire relation to which the operation is applied.\n\nLet's assume that we have a table named {{mono|Account}} with three columns, namely {{mono|Account_Number, Branch_Name}} and {{mono|Balance}}. We wish to find the maximum balance of each branch. This is accomplished by <sub>{{mono|Branch_Name}}</sub>''G''<sub>Max({{mono|Balance}})</sub>({{mono|Account}}). To find the highest balance of all accounts regardless of branch, we could simply write ''G''<sub>Max({{mono|Balance}})</sub>({{mono|Account}}).\n\n=== Transitive closure ===\nAlthough relational algebra seems powerful enough for most practical purposes, there are some simple and natural operators on [[relation (database)|relation]]s that cannot be expressed by relational algebra. One of them is the [[transitive closure]] of a binary relation. Given a domain ''D'', let binary relation ''R'' be a subset of ''D''&times;''D''. The transitive closure ''R<sup>+</sup>'' of ''R'' is the smallest subset of ''D''&times;''D'' that contains ''R'' and satisfies the following condition:\n\n:<math>\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z \\left( (x,y) \\in R^+ \\wedge (y,z) \\in R^+ \\Rightarrow (x,z) \\in R^+ \\right)</math>\n\nThere is no relational algebra expression ''E''(''R'') taking ''R'' as a variable argument that produces ''R''<sup>+</sup>. This can be proved using the fact that, given a relational expression ''E'' for which it is claimed that ''E''(''R'') = ''R''<sup>+</sup>, where ''R'' is a variable, we can always find an instance '''''r''''' of ''R'' (and a corresponding domain '''d''') such that ''E''('''''r''''') \u2260 '''''r'''''<sup>+</sup>.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Universality of data retrieval languages|journal=Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|year=1979|first=Alfred V.|last=Aho|author2=Jeffrey D.

Our secondary goal is to try to form common subexpressions within a single query, or if there is more than one query being evaluated at the same time, in all of those queries. The rationale behind the second goal is that it is enough to compute common subexpressions once, and the results can be used in all queries that contain that subexpression.\n\nHere we present a set of rules that can be used in such transformations.\n\n=== Selection ===\n\nRules about selection operators play the most important role in query optimization. Selection is an operator that very effectively decreases the number of rows in its operand, so if we manage to move the selections in an expression tree towards the leaves, the internal [[relation (database)|relation]]s (yielded by subexpressions) will likely shrink.\n\n==== Basic selection properties ====\n\nSelection is [[idempotent]] (multiple applications of the same selection have no additional effect beyond the first one), and [[commutative]] (the order selections are applied in has no effect on the eventual result).\n\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R)=\\sigma_{A}\\sigma_{A}(R)\\,\\!</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}\\sigma_{B}(R)=\\sigma_{B}\\sigma_{A}(R)\\,\\!</math>\n\n==== Breaking up selections with complex conditions ====\n\nA selection whose condition is a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of simpler conditions is equivalent to a sequence of selections with those same individual conditions, and selection whose condition is a [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] is equivalent to a union of selections.  These identities can be used to merge selections so that fewer selections need to be evaluated, or to split them so that the component selections may be moved or optimized separately.\n\n#<math>\\sigma_{A \\land B}(R)=\\sigma_{A}(\\sigma_{B}(R))=\\sigma_{B}(\\sigma_{A}(R))</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A \\lor B}(R)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cup\\sigma_{B}(R)</math>\n\n==== Selection and cross product ====\nCross product is the costliest operator to evaluate. If the input [[relation (database)|relation]]s have ''N'' and ''M'' rows, the result will contain <math>NM</math> rows. Therefore, it is very important to do our best to decrease the size of both operands before applying the cross product operator.\n\nThis can be effectively done if the cross product is followed by a selection operator, e.g. <math>\\sigma_{A}(R \\times P)</math>. Considering the definition of join, this is the most likely case. If the cross product is not followed by a selection operator, we can try to push down a selection from higher levels of the expression tree using the other selection rules.\n\nIn the above case we break up condition ''A'' into conditions ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' using the split rules about complex selection conditions, so that <math>A = B \\wedge C \\wedge D</math> and ''B'' contains attributes only from ''R'', ''C'' contains attributes only from ''P'', and ''D'' contains the part of ''A'' that contains attributes from both ''R'' and ''P''. Note, that ''B'', ''C'' or ''D'' are possibly empty. Then the following holds:\n:<math>\\sigma_{A}(R \\times P) = \\sigma_{B \\wedge C \\wedge D}(R \\times P) = \\sigma_{D}(\\sigma_{B}(R) \\times \\sigma_{C}(P))</math>\n\n==== Selection and set operators ====\nSelection is [[distributive property|distributive]] over the set difference, intersection, and union operators.  The following three rules are used to push selection below set operations in the expression tree. For the set difference and the intersection operators, it is possible to apply the selection operator to just one of the operands following the transformation. This can be beneficial where one of the operands is small, and the overhead of evaluating the selection operator outweighs the benefits of using a smaller [[relation (database)|relation]] as an operand.\n\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R\\setminus P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\setminus \\sigma_{A}(P) =\\sigma_{A}(R)\\setminus P</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R\\cup P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cup\\sigma_{A}(P)</math>\n#<math>\\sigma_{A}(R\\cap P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cap\\sigma_{A}(P)=\\sigma_{A}(R)\\cap P=R\\cap \\sigma_{A}(P)</math>\n\n==== Selection and projection ====\n\nSelection commutes with projection if and only if the fields referenced in the selection condition are a subset of the fields in the projection.  Performing selection before projection may be useful if the operand is a cross product or join.  In other cases, if the selection condition is relatively expensive to compute, moving selection outside the projection may reduce the number of tuples which must be tested (since projection may produce fewer tuples due to the elimination of duplicates resulting from omitted fields).\n\n:<math>\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots ,a_n}(\\sigma_A( R )) = \\sigma_A(\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots,a_n}( R ))\\text{ where fields in }A \\subseteq \\{a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\}</math>\n\n=== Projection ===\n\n==== Basic projection properties ====\n\nProjection is idempotent, so that a series of (valid) projections is equivalent to the outermost projection.\n\n:<math>\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots , a_n}(\\pi_{b_1,\\ldots , b_m}(R)) = \\pi_{a_1, \\ldots , a_n}(R)\\text{ where }\\{a_1, \\ldots , a_n\\} \\subseteq \\{b_1, \\ldots , b_m\\}</math>\n\n==== Projection and set operators ====\n\nProjection is [[distributive property|distributive]] over set union.\n\n:<math>\\pi_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}(R \\cup P) = \\pi_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}(R) \\cup \\pi_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}(P). \\, </math>\n\nProjection does not distribute over intersection and set difference. Counterexamples are given by:\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\} \\cap \\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\emptyset</math>\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\}) \\cap \\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\{ \\langle A=a \\rangle \\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\} \\setminus \\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\{ \\langle A=a\\rangle \\}</math>\n\n:<math>\\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b \\rangle \\}) \\setminus \\pi_A(\\{ \\langle A=a, B=b' \\rangle \\}) = \\emptyset\\,,</math>\nwhere ''b'' is assumed to be distinct from {{var|b'}}.\n\n=== Rename ===\n\n==== Basic rename properties ====\n\nSuccessive renames of a variable can be collapsed into a single rename.  Rename operations which have no variables in common can be arbitrarily reordered with respect to one another, which can be exploited to make successive renames adjacent so that they can be collapsed.\n\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(\\rho_{b / c}(R)) = \\rho_{a / c}(R)\\,\\!</math>\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(\\rho_{c / d}(R)) = \\rho_{c / d}(\\rho_{a / b}(R))\\,\\!</math>\n\n==== Rename and set operators ====\n\nRename is distributive over set difference, union, and intersection.\n\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(R \\setminus P) = \\rho_{a / b}(R) \\setminus \\rho_{a / b}(P)</math>\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(R \\cup P) = \\rho_{a / b}(R) \\cup \\rho_{a / b}(P)</math>\n#<math>\\rho_{a / b}(R \\cap P) = \\rho_{a / b}(R) \\cap \\rho_{a / b}(P)</math>\n\n=== Product and union ===\n\nCartesian product is distributive over union.\n\n#<math>(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) = A \\times (B \\cup C)</math>\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nThe first query language to be based on Codd's algebra was Alpha, developed by Dr. Codd himself. Subsequently, [[ISBL]] was created, and this pioneering work has been acclaimed by many authorities [http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/codd_1000892.cfm] as having shown the way to make Codd's idea into a useful language. [[Business System 12]] was a short-lived industry-strength relational DBMS that followed the ISBL example.\n\nIn 1998 [[Christopher J. Date|Chris Date]] and [[Hugh Darwen]] proposed a language called '''[[Tutorial D]]''' intended for use in teaching relational database theory, and its query language also draws on ISBL's ideas. [[Rel (DBMS)|Rel]] is an implementation of '''Tutorial D'''.\n\nEven the query language of [[SQL]] is loosely based on a relational algebra, though the operands in SQL ([[table (database)|table]]s) are not exactly [[relation (database)|relation]]s and several useful theorems about the relational algebra do not hold in the SQL counterpart (arguably to the detriment of optimisers and/or users). The SQL table model is a bag ([[multiset]]), rather than a set. For example, the expression <math>(R \\cup S) \\setminus T = (R \\setminus T) \\cup (S \\setminus T)</math> is a theorem for relational algebra on sets, but not for relational algebra on bags; for a treatment of relational algebra on bags see chapter 5 of the \"Complete\" textbook by [[Garcia-Molina]], [[Jeffrey Ullman|Ullman]] and [[Jennifer Widom|Widom]].<ref name=\"Garcia-MolinaUllman2009\">{{cite book|author1=Hector Garcia-Molina|author2=Jeffrey D.

A third film, ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' is in development and is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[San Dimas, California]], [[slacker]]s Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted (Theodore) Logan would rather pursue their band the Wyld Stallyns (Although they're rather inept at guitar and aren't even truly interested in learning to play better) than schoolwork. Bill and Ted are failing history, and they need an A+ on their history report if they want to pass the class. Ted's father, the local police captain, threatens to send Ted to military school in Alaska if they should flunk their history class (and school along with it), ruining their dreams of success. The two struggle to assemble a final report for the class, which is to describe how three historical figures would see modern-day San Dimas.\n\nSeven hundred years from then, in 2688, humanity has built a [[utopia]], thanks to the music of Wyld Stallyns. The supreme beings of this world instruct Rufus (Carlin) to travel back in time by a [[time travel|time machine]] disguised as a [[phone booth]], to help Bill and Ted pass their class. Rufus lands by the two as they work on their report near a [[Circle K]]. As he introduces himself, a second phone booth lands nearby, and future versions of Bill and Ted come out, proving their identity to their younger selves, and telling them to trust Rufus before they leave. Rufus offers to show the teens how the machine works, taking them to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1805, where [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is commanding the [[French Revolutionary Army|French Army]]. Assured the machine works, Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, though Napoleon, knocked back by an explosion, is caught in the phone booth's wake and dragged with them. Back at Ted's house, Rufus provides the teens additional instructions and then leaves before another identical phone booth time machine shows up. The two find Napoleon, passed out nearby, and come upon an idea of taking historical figures from the past to bring them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon, and set out. Before they go, Ted's father chews him out for failing history, losing his keys and not focusing on his schoolwork and grounds him until Ted ships out to military school the following night. Bill calls from the phone booth passing himself off as a new deputy, and instructing him to come the station to retrieve his lost keys, allowing Ted to escape, so they can work on their report. \n\nSeparately, they gain the trust of [[Billy the Kid]] from 1879, and [[Socrates]] from 410 BC, and bring them along. They next land in 15th century medieval England, and see two princesses, who flirt with them. Bill and Ted attempt help them escape, because their father has arranged marriage for both of them to \"two fat horrible old men\", but are caught by their father, the local king (whose entourage they refer to as 'royal ugly dudes'), and ordered to be beheaded. They are rescued at the last minute by Billy and Socrates, but in their escape, the phone booth's antenna is damaged by a knight's mace, and the booth starts running out of control. After a brief landing in the utopian society of 2688, Bill and Ted initially take advantage of it by obtaining more historical figures for extra credit, including [[Sigmund Freud]] from Vienna, Austria in 1901; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] from Kassel, Germany in 1810; [[Joan of Arc]] from Orleans, France in 1429; [[Genghis Khan]] from Outer Mongolia in 1209; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Washington, DC in 1863. With no more space in the booth, they finally see the broken antenna, and have to make a pit-stop in prehistoric times to make repairs. After a crude repair with chewing gum and pudding cups, Bill and Ted regain control of the booth, but they end up at the Circle K, witnessing their past selves on the night before the report. They repeat their advice to them about Rufus, and then ask Rufus how to get to their present time; Rufus also alerts them that time is running short.\n\nBack in their current timeframe, with two hours before the report presentation, Bill and Ted leave the historical figures at the local mall to experience San Dimas, while they try to track down Napoleon, whom Deacon had ditched the previous night after an embarrassing night out. They find Napoleon at the Waterloo water park, but by the time they return to the mall, the historical figures have caused a commotion, and are now in jail under Ted's father's watch, and he refuses to set them free. They develop a plan to use the time machine after the presentation as to plant elements via [[Causal loop|predestination paradoxes]] to help free the historical figures (finally explaining the disappearance of Ted's father's lost keys), and make their way to the school, barely arriving in time for their presentation. With the help of the historical figures, the two give an impressive presentation that ensures they pass the course.\n\nAfter returning the historical figures and successfully getting an A+ on their history report, Bill and Ted return to practice, and having matured somewhat along the journey, they decide maybe they should actually take time to learn to play better, when Rufus shows up with the two princesses in tow, having rescued them himself since he knows they will be their wives and bandmates in the future. As the band starts to play, terribly, Rufus [[Fourth wall|explains to the audience]], \"They do get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter, and George Carlin}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \u2018\u2019Theodore\u2019\u2019 Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

Alongside Reeves, 24 actors were called back and auditioned in various pairs to find a good chemistry. On that day, Reeves was one of the first to arrive along with [[Alex Winter]], and while waiting for the auditions to start, found out they had a lot of personal details in common, such as a common interest in [[bass guitar]] and [[motorcycle]]s.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> They quickly developed a rapport between each other during auditions, which earned them the title roles.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> A longstanding urban legend has it that Reeves auditioned for Bill and Winter for Ted.

Herek stated that their intention was to have [[Eddie Van Halen]] as Rufus, given the frequency of [[Van Halen]] references in the screenplay, but this was not possible because of the low budget for the film. They started looking at other actors who would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at Waterloo are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]].

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult as to come up with the practical effects of filming the booth with multiple people standing inside it on a [[gimble]] in front of a [[green screen]] with numerous equipment and prop failures; Reeves called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you\u2019ve ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> Winter had found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive in February 2020 and shared them on the Internet and provided additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019 Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | accessdate = February 23, 2020 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the films credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \"Are there kids that really speak like this?\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Some of the former DEG executives ended up at [[Nelson Entertainment]], and along with [[Orion Pictures]], were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about {{USD|1 million}}.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Bill & Ted'' had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> It was followed in 1991 by a [[sequel]], ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam rock]], [[glam metal]], [[pop rock]], [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = A&M Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.

The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | authorlink= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate= 29 May 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1980s}}\n*[[Deus ex machina]]\n*[[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0096928}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098752}} (animated TV series)\n* {{IMDb title|0103365}} (TV series)\n* {{Amg title|5541}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Stephen Herek}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Socrates]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Genghis Khan on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven on film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films about Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1st century BC]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1420s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1805]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1879]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1901]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:San Dimas, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1989 film directed by Stephen Herek}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\n| image = Bill & Ted.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Theatrical release poster\n| director = [[Stephen Herek]]\n| producers = {{Plainlist|\n* Scott Kroopf\n* Michael S.

A third film, ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' is in development and is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[San Dimas, California]], [[slacker]]s Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted (Theodore) Logan would rather pursue their band the Wyld Stallyns (Although they're rather inept at guitar and aren't even truly interested in learning to play better) than schoolwork. Bill and Ted are failing history, and they need an A+ on their history report if they want to pass the class. Ted's father, the local police captain, threatens to send Ted to military school in Alaska if they should flunk their history class (and school along with it), ruining their dreams of success. The two struggle to assemble a final report for the class, which is to describe how three historical figures would see modern-day San Dimas.\n\nSeven hundred years from then, in 2688, humanity has built a [[utopia]], thanks to the music of Wyld Stallyns. The supreme beings of this world instruct Rufus (Carlin) to travel back in time by a [[time travel|time machine]] disguised as a [[phone booth]], to help Bill and Ted pass their class. Rufus lands by the two as they work on their report near a [[Circle K]]. As he introduces himself, a second phone booth lands nearby, and future versions of Bill and Ted come out, proving their identity to their younger selves, and telling them to trust Rufus before they leave. Rufus offers to show the teens how the machine works, taking them to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1805, where [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is commanding the [[French Revolutionary Army|French Army]]. Assured the machine works, Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, though Napoleon, knocked back by an explosion, is caught in the phone booth's wake and dragged with them. Back at Ted's house, Rufus provides the teens additional instructions and then leaves before another identical phone booth time machine shows up. The two find Napoleon, passed out nearby, and come upon an idea of taking historical figures from the past to bring them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon, and set out. Before they go, Ted's father chews him out for failing history, losing his keys and not focusing on his schoolwork and grounds him until Ted ships out to military school the following night. Bill calls from the phone booth passing himself off as a new deputy, and instructing him to come the station to retrieve his lost keys, allowing Ted to escape, so they can work on their report. \n\nSeparately, they gain the trust of [[Billy the Kid]] from 1879, and [[Socrates]] from 410 BC, and bring them along. They next land in 15th century medieval England, and see two princesses, who flirt with them. Bill and Ted attempt help them escape, because their father has arranged marriage for both of them to \"two fat horrible old men\", but are caught by their father, the local king (whose entourage they refer to as 'royal ugly dudes'), and ordered to be beheaded. They are rescued at the last minute by Billy and Socrates, but in their escape, the phone booth's antenna is damaged by a knight's mace, and the booth starts running out of control. After a brief landing in the utopian society of 2688, Bill and Ted initially take advantage of it by obtaining more historical figures for extra credit, including [[Sigmund Freud]] from Vienna, Austria in 1901; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] from Kassel, Germany in 1810; [[Joan of Arc]] from Orleans, France in 1429; [[Genghis Khan]] from Outer Mongolia in 1209; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Washington, DC in 1863. With no more space in the booth, they finally see the broken antenna, and have to make a pit-stop in prehistoric times to make repairs. After a crude repair with chewing gum and pudding cups, Bill and Ted regain control of the booth, but they end up at the Circle K, witnessing their past selves on the night before the report. They repeat their advice to them about Rufus, and then ask Rufus how to get to their present time; Rufus also alerts them that time is running short.\n\nBack in their current timeframe, with two hours before the report presentation, Bill and Ted leave the historical figures at the local mall to experience San Dimas, while they try to track down Napoleon, whom Deacon had ditched the previous night after an embarrassing night out. They find Napoleon at the Waterloo water park, but by the time they return to the mall, the historical figures have caused a commotion, and are now in jail under Ted's father's watch, and he refuses to set them free. They develop a plan to use the time machine after the presentation as to plant elements via [[Causal loop|predestination paradoxes]] to help free the historical figures (finally explaining the disappearance of Ted's father's lost keys), and make their way to the school, barely arriving in time for their presentation. With the help of the historical figures, the two give an impressive presentation that ensures they pass the course.\n\nAfter returning the historical figures and successfully getting an A+ on their history report, Bill and Ted return to practice, and having matured somewhat along the journey, they decide maybe they should actually take time to learn to play better, when Rufus shows up with the two princesses in tow, having rescued them himself since he knows they will be their wives and bandmates in the future. As the band starts to play, terribly, Rufus [[Fourth wall|explains to the audience]], \"They do get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter, and George Carlin}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \u2018\u2019Theodore\u2019\u2019 Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

According to Winter, the story emerged because the characters are so similar, and even he and Reeves sometimes became confused about who was who.<ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/bill-ted-25th-anniversary-trivia/|title=Bill & Ted at 25: Dude, Bet You Didn\u2019t Know These 7 Gnarly Facts|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|date=17 February 2014|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=1 June 2016|location=San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nThrough rehearsals, Winter and Reeves worked on developing their Bill & Ted characters to move them away from being stereotypical comedic slackers and insert sincerity and other more human elements into them.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> While they developed mannerisms outside of the script, influenced partially by British comedians like [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Spike Milligan]], the pair kept to the dialog written by Solomon and Mathseon, with Winter calling it \"very floral, so paradoxical to how you think dumb Valley guys would speak\".<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Winter said that to develop Bill's character, he borrowed from the looks and trends along [[Venice Beach]], California, where he had been living, including wearing a baseball cap backwards and pulling part of his hair through that opening.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/>\n\nWinter said of casting [[George Carlin]] as Rufus as a \"very happy accident\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/|title=Hey, Alex Winter here from Bill & Ted and Downloaded and noticed a lot of child stars memes today.

Herek stated that their intention was to have [[Eddie Van Halen]] as Rufus, given the frequency of [[Van Halen]] references in the screenplay, but because of the low budget for the film, they could not get to happen. They started looking at other acting experience that would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian, and turned their thinking around to look at comedians. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at Waterloo are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]].

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult as to come up with the practical effects of filming the booth with multiple people standing inside it on a [[gimble]] in front of a [[green screen]] with numerous equipment and prop failures; Reeves called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you\u2019ve ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> Winter had found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive in February 2020 and shared them on the Internet and provided additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019 Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | accessdate = February 23, 2020 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the films credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \"Are there kids that really speak like this?\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Some of the former DEG executives ended up at [[Nelson Entertainment]], and along with [[Orion Pictures]], were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about {{USD|1 million}}.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Bill & Ted'' had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> It was followed in 1991 by a [[sequel]], ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam rock]], [[glam metal]], [[pop rock]], [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = A&M Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.

The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | authorlink= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate= 29 May 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1980s}}\n*[[Deus ex machina]]\n*[[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0096928}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098752}} (animated TV series)\n* {{IMDb title|0103365}} (TV series)\n* {{Amg title|5541}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Stephen Herek}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Socrates]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Genghis Khan on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven on film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films about Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1st century BC]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1420s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1805]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1879]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1901]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:San Dimas, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n", "name_user": "Davidnicholsknowsbest", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCasting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure"}

If proper precautions are not taken, unnaturally high concentrations of chemicals, such as [[arsenic]], [[sulfuric acid]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] over a significant area of surface or subsurface water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/3|title=January 2009|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> With large amounts of water used for mine drainage, mine cooling, aqueous extraction and other mining processes, increases the potential for these chemicals to contaminate ground and surface water. As mining produces copious amounts of waste water, disposal methods are limited due to contaminates within the waste water. Runoff containing these chemicals can lead to the devastation of the surrounding vegetation. The dumping of the runoff in surface waters or in a lot of forests is the worst option. Therefore, submarine tailings disposal are regarded as a better option (if the waste is pumped to great depth).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/6|title=January 2009|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> Land storage and refilling of the mine after it has been depleted is even better, if no forests need to be cleared for the storage of debris. The contamination of watersheds resulting from the leakage of chemicals also has an effect on the health of the local population.\n\nIn well-regulated mines, hydrologists and geologists take careful measurements of water to take precaution to exclude any type of [[Water pollution|water contamination]] that could be caused by the mine's operations. The minimization of [[environmental degradation]] is enforced in American mining practices by federal and state law, by restricting operators to meet standards for the protection of surface and groundwater from contamination.<ref>The principal federal laws are:\n* [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste management and groundwater protection). {{uspl|94|580}}, {{USC|42|6901}}\n* [[Clean Water Act]] (surface water pollution control). {{uspl|92|500}}, {{USC|33|1251}}</ref> This is best done through the use of non-toxic extraction processes as [[bioleaching]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asante|first=Ramseyer|date=March 29, 2017|title=Environmental Impact of Mining|url=|journal=Global Congress on Process Safety|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Acid rock drainage===\n{{main|Acid mine drainage}}\nSub-surface mining often progresses below the water table, so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations.[[File:Lagoa vermelha na Mina do Losal 05.jpg|thumb|right|[[Acid mine drainage]] in [[Portugal]]]]Acid rock drainage occurs naturally within some environments as part of the rock weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid mine drainage (AMD). The same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of acid sulfate soils formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar environmental hazard.\n\nThe five principal technologies used to monitor and control water flow at mine sites are diversion systems, containment ponds, groundwater pumping systems, subsurface drainage systems, and subsurface barriers. In the case of AMD, contaminated water is generally pumped to a treatment facility that neutralizes the contaminants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itech.fgcu.edu/faculty/ndemers/Miningconference/mcindex.htm|title=Mining conference 2008|website=itech.fgcu.edu}}</ref> A 2006 review of environmental impact statements found that \"water quality predictions made after considering the effects of mitigation largely underestimated actual impacts to groundwater, [[Petroleum seep|seeps]], and surface water\".<ref>Maest et al. 2006.

The materials that are left over after are a result of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of ore.

There are many diseases that can come from the pollutants that are released into the air and water during the mining process. For example, during smelting operations large quantities of air pollutants, such as the suspended particulate matter, SO<sub>x</sub>, arsenic particles and cadmium, are emitted. Metals are usually emitted into the air as particulates as well. \n\nThere are also many occupational health hazards that miners face. Most of miners suffer from various respiratory and skin diseases such as [[asbestosis]], [[silicosis]], or [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]]. \n\n==Coal mining==\n\n\nThe environmental factors of the coal industry are not only impacting air pollution, [[water management]] and land use but also is causing severe health effects by the burning of the coal. [[Air pollution]] is increasing in numbers of toxins such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and other [[heavy metals]]. This is causing health issues involving breathing difficulties and is impacting the wildlife around the surrounding areas that is needs clean air to survive.  The future of air pollution remains unclear as the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] have tried to prevent some emissions but don't have control measures in place for all plants producing mining of coal. Water pollution is another factor that is being damaged throughout this process of mining coals, the ashes from coal is usually carried away in rainwater which streams into larger water sites. It can take up to 10 years to clean water sites that have coal waste and the potential of damaging clean water can only make the filtration much more difficult. \n {{main|Environmental effects of coal}}\n\n==Deforestation==\nWith [[open cast mining]] the overburden, which may be covered in forest, must be removed before the mining can commence.

Mining [[oil shale]] impacts the environment it can damage the biological land and ecosystems. The thermal heating and combustion generate a lot of material and waste that includes [[carbon dioxide]] and [[greenhouse gas]]. Many environmentalists are against the production and usage of oil shale because it creates large amounts of greenhouse gasses. Among air pollution, water contamination is a huge factor mainly because oil shales are dealing with [[oxygen]] and [[hydrocarbons]].

As mining produces copious amounts of waste water, disposal methods are limited due to contaminates within the waste water. Runoff containing these chemicals can lead to the devastation of the surrounding vegetation. The dumping of the runoff in surface waters or in a lot of forests is the worst option. Therefore, submarine tailings disposal are regarded as a better option (if the waste is pumped to great depth).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/6|title=January 2009|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> Land storage and refilling of the mine after it has been depleted is even better, if no forests need to be cleared for the storage of debris. The contamination of watersheds resulting from the leakage of chemicals also has an effect on the health of the local population.\n\nIn well-regulated mines, hydrologists and geologists take careful measurements of water to take precaution to exclude any type of [[Water pollution|water contamination]] that could be caused by the mine's operations. The minimization of [[environmental degradation]] is enforced in American mining practices by federal and state law, by restricting operators to meet standards for the protection of surface and groundwater from contamination.<ref>The principal federal laws are:\n* [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste management and groundwater protection). {{uspl|94|580}}, {{USC|42|6901}}\n* [[Clean Water Act]] (surface water pollution control). {{uspl|92|500}}, {{USC|33|1251}}</ref> This is best done through the use of non-toxic extraction processes as [[bioleaching]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asante|first=Ramseyer|date=March 29, 2017|title=Environmental Impact of Mining|url=|journal=Global Congress on Process Safety|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Acid rock drainage===\n{{main|Acid mine drainage}}\nSub-surface mining often progresses below the water table, so water must be constantly pumped out of the mine in order to prevent flooding. When a mine is abandoned, the pumping ceases, and water floods the mine. This introduction of water is the initial step in most acid rock drainage situations.[[File:Lagoa vermelha na Mina do Losal 05.jpg|thumb|right|[[Acid mine drainage]] in [[Portugal]]]]Acid rock drainage occurs naturally within some environments as part of the rock weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid mine drainage (AMD). The same type of chemical reactions and processes may occur through the disturbance of acid sulfate soils formed under coastal or estuarine conditions after the last major sea level rise, and constitutes a similar environmental hazard.\n\nThe five principal technologies used to monitor and control water flow at mine sites are diversion systems, containment ponds, groundwater pumping systems, subsurface drainage systems, and subsurface barriers. In the case of AMD, contaminated water is generally pumped to a treatment facility that neutralizes the contaminants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itech.fgcu.edu/faculty/ndemers/Miningconference/mcindex.htm|title=Mining conference 2008|website=itech.fgcu.edu}}</ref> A 2006 review of environmental impact statements found that \"water quality predictions made after considering the effects of mitigation largely underestimated actual impacts to groundwater, [[Petroleum seep|seeps]], and surface water\".<ref>Maest et al. 2006.

There are many diseases that can come from the pollutants that are released into the air and water during the mining process. For example, during smelting operations large quantities of air pollutants, such as the suspended particulate matter, SO<sub>x</sub>, arsenic particles and cadmium, are emitted. Metals are usually emitted into the air as particulates as well. \n\nThere are also many occupational health hazards that miners face. Most of miners suffer from various respiratory and skin diseases such as [[asbestosis]], [[silicosis]], or [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]]. \n\n==Coal mining==\n\n\nThe environmental factors of the coal industry are not only impacting air pollution, [[water management]] and land use but also is causing severe health effects by the burning of the coal. [[Air pollution]] is increasing in numbers of toxins such as [[mercury]], [[lead]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and other [[heavy metals]]. This is causing health issues involving breathing difficulties and is impacting the wildlife around the surrounding areas that is needs clean air to survive.  The future of air pollution remains unclear as the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] have tried to prevent some emissions but don't have control measures in place for all plants producing mining of coal. Water pollution is another factor that is being damaged throughout this process of mining coals, the ashes from coal is usually carried away in rainwater which streams into larger water sites. It can take up to 10 years to clean water sites that have coal waste and the potential of damaging clean water can only make the filtration much more difficult. \n {{main|Environmental effects of coal}}\n\n==Deforestation==\nWith [[open cast mining]] the overburden, which may be covered in forest, must be removed before the mining can commence.

At times, mining can extend so deeply that it affects ground water, springs, underground wells, and the water table.\n==Mitigation==\n{{see also|Responsible mining|Restoration ecology}}\n\nTo ensure completion of [[land reclamation|reclamation]], or restoring mine land for future use, many governments and regulatory authorities around the world require that mining companies post a bond to be held in escrow until productivity of [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] has been convincingly demonstrated, although if cleanup procedures are more expensive than the size of the bond, the bond may simply be abandoned. Since 1978 the mining industry has reclaimed more than 2 million acres (8,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land in the United States alone. This reclaimed land has renewed vegetation and wildlife in previous mining lands and can even be used for farming and ranching.\n\n==Specific sites==\n*[[Tui mine]] in New Zealand\n*[[Stockton mine]] in New Zealand\n*[[Northland Pyrite Mine]] in Temagami, Ontario, Canada\n*[[Sherman Mine]] in Temagami, Ontario, Canada\n*[[Ok Tedi Mine]] in Western Province, Papua New Guinea\n*The [[Berkeley Pit]]\n*[[Wheal Jane|Wheal Jane Mine]]s\n\n==Film and literature==\n*''[[Burning the Future: Coal in America]]''\n*''[[Coal River (book)|Coal River]]''\n*''[[Mountain Top Removal (film)|Mountain Top Removal]]''\n*''[[Moving Mountains: How One Woman and Her Community Won Justice From Big Coal]]''\n*''[[Tar Creek (film)|Tar Creek]]''\n*''[[Trou story]]''\n\n==See also==\n*[[Environmental impact of deep sea mining]]\n*[[Environmental effects of placer mining]]\n*[[Environmental impact of gold mining]]\n*[[Environmental impact of zinc mining]]\n*[[List of environmental issues]]\n*[[Appalachian Voices]], a lobby group in the United States\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Human impact on the environment}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Environmental Issues With Mining}}\n[[Category:Environmental impact of mining| ]]\n<br />\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:mercury\u2192mercury (element)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_mining"}
