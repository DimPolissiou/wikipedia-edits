In a career spanning over 30 years, Krevoy has been directly involved in the development, finance, production, acquisition, and distribution of more than 100 motion picture and television projects, most famously the 1994 blockbuster comedy ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''. Lately, he has become known as one of the leading producers of Christmas themed entertainment, having produced many successful holiday movies, including Netflix\u2019s ''[[A Christmas Prince]]'' trilogy, and ''[[The Princess Switch]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Netflix's 'A Christmas Prince' Is Just the Start of the Streaming Giant's Quest for Christmas Dominance |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/netflix-a-christmas-prince-christmas-streaming-takeover-hallmark-1201908222/}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nKrevoy graduated from [[Beverly Hills High School]]. He went on to study at [[Stanford University]], graduating in 1978 with a BA in Political Science. To this day he still maintains a strong connection to the university. He then went on to study at [[UC Hastings]], College of the Law. After graduation, he served as a Legislative Fellow in the California State Legislature and worked as an entertainment attorney at a prominent Los Angeles law firm.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brad Krevoy Bio |url=http://www.mpcafilm.com/bios/}}</ref>\n\n==Early career and work with Roger Corman (1983\u20131986)==\n\nKrevoy's major entry into the film industry came from a chance encounter with [[Roger Corman]] at a Stanford football game in 1983. The two discussed the promising new home video market and two days later Brad was working for Corman's Concorde-New Horizon pictures, handling the business affairs.\n\nKrevoy's role was initially to look for new opportunities and sources of funding. His interest in the home video market paid off with Concorde quickly becoming one of the largest suppliers of VHS tapes, having deals in place with every major distributor in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brad Krevoy: Dumb (and Dumber) like a Fox |url=https://beverlygray.blogspot.com/2014/11/brad-krevoy-dumb-and-dumber-like-fox.html}}</ref>\n\n==MPCA (1986\u20131996)==\n\nIn 1986, Krevoy and his longtime business partner Steve Stabler co-founded Motion Picture Corporation of America (MPCA). The goal of the company was to focus on producing, acquiring and distributing commercial motion picture and television productions. Using the skills he learned during his time with Roger Corman, Krevoy managed to position MPCA as one of the largest suppliers of high-quality, lower-budget films.\n\nDuring the company's formative years, they produced a few cult favorites, including ''[[The Purple People Eater]]'' (1988) with [[Ned Beatty]]; ''Back to Back'' (1989), starring [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Apollonia Kotero|Apollonia]]; and the sex comedy ''[[Miracle Beach]]'' (1992).\n\n==Dumb and Dumber==\n\nKrevoy and Stabler took the company to new heights when they released the 1994 blockbuster comedy ''Dumb and Dumber''. The script had been around for nearly seven years and was rejected by every major studio. The writers, [[Bobby Farrelly|Bobby]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], desperately wanted to direct the feature as well, but no one would give them a shot. Once Krevoy and MPCA got behind the script, they were able to package the project, complete with the Farrellys directing and then rising star, [[Jim Carrey]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Lloyd |title=Produce Your Own Damn Movie! |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0240810454 |page=223|year=2009 }}</ref>\n\n''Dumb and Dumber'' broke box office comedy records; it also opened and remained at number 1 on the U.S. box office for 4 straight weeks over the holiday season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dumb and Dumber Weekend |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=dumbanddumber.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film went on to gross $127 million domestically and $120 million overseas for a worldwide total of $247 million off of a $16 million budget.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dumb and Dumber |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=dumbanddumber.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film was one of the highest grossing comedies of the 90's. Combined with its ancillary and video sales, the film is estimated to have grossed over half a billion dollars.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Lloyd |title=Produce Your Own Damn Movie! |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0240810454 |page=223|year=2009 }}</ref>\n\n''Dumb and Dumber'' propelled the Farrellys' directing career; they became known as the top comedy directors of the time. Krevoy was able to use this success to get the Farrellys' passion project, ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', off the ground. It was released in June 1996, starring [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Randy Quaid]] and [[Bill Murray]]. Despite many critics praising the film, it was a commercial disappointment, grossing only $27 million against a $25 million budget over the course of its theatrical run.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingpin |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kingpin.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] championed the film and gave it 3 and a half stars out 4, praising the film's daring comedy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingpin Review |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kingpin-1996 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> ''Kingpin'' became a huge release on home video, finding a dedicated and passionate cult following.<ref>{{cite web |title='Kingpin': The Farrelly Brothers' Biggest Flop and Greatest Triumph |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/ |website=Vulture.com |access-date=2018-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520142417/http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/ |archive-date=2014-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nKrevoy and MPCA expanded on their success and went on to produce more big-budget studio comedies, including ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'' starring [[Chris Farley]] and ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'' with [[Tim Allen]]. They also produced ''[[Threesome]]'', starring [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]]. The film was one of the most successful independent arthouse films of the year, grossing just under $15 million domestically.<ref>{{cite web |title=Threesome (1994) \u2013 Box Office Mojo |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=threesome.htm |website=www.boxofficemojo.com |language=en}}</ref> ''Threesome'' was an autobiographical comedy by writer and director, [[Andrew Fleming]].

Krevoy and MPCA also signed a first-look deal with Sony Pictures in the late 90s, where they produced more than 10 movies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paramount gets first look at MPCA |url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/par-gets-first-look-at-mpca-99129209/ |website=Variety |date=6 November 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Co-president of Orion Pictures (1996\u20131998)==\n\nIn 1996, MPCA was purchased by John Kluge's Metromedia International Group. Metromedia had just purchased the independent production company Orion Pictures from chapter 11 bankruptcy. When MPCA was merged into the company, Krevoy and Stabler took over as the Co-President's of [[Orion Pictures]] and were given a six-picture deal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horn |first1=John |title=Coming soon, to very few theaters |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/21/entertainment/et-mgm21 |website=Los Angeles Times |date=21 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt Orion, Krevoy oversaw the production, acquisition, and distribution of Orion's motion picture and television programming. He produced films for Academy Award-winner Tom Schulman (''[[Dead Poets Society]]'') and released films such as 1997's Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, ''[[Prisoner of the Mountains]]'' (directed by [[Sergei Bodrov]]), and the acclaimed ''[[Ulee's Gold]]'' (directed by [[Victor Nunez]] and presented by [[Jonathan Demme]]). ''Ulee\u2019s Gold'' was a critical hit and won its leading actor, [[Peter Fonda]], his first and only Golden Globe for best actor. Fonda also received his first and only Oscar nomination for best actor.\n\nAfter two years of revitalizing Orion Pictures, Metromedia went on to sell Orion to MGM. Krevoy was able to take the MPCA name back as part of his original deal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiner |first1=Rex |title=MGM ends Orion orbit |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/mgm-ends-orion-orbit-1116676950/ |website=Variety |date=11 July 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Restarting MPCA (1998\u20132014)==\n\nIn 1998, Krevoy returned to his independent filmmaking roots and restarted MPCA with a distribution deal through MGM.\n\nSince rebooting MPCA, Krevoy has produced a wide array of motion pictures including: boxing drama ''[[Joe and Max]]'' (which collected both [[ESPN]] and [[ACE Awards|ACE]] award nominations); the 2002 Sundance premiere ''[[Bookies]]'' (for director [[Mark Illsley]] of ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]'' fame); and ''[[Boat Trip (film)|Boat Trip]]'' starring Academy Award-winner [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Horatio Sanz]], [[Vivica A. Fox]], and [[Roger Moore]] for Artisan/[[Lionsgate]].\n\nIn 2004 Krevoy produced the drama, ''[[A Love Song for Bobby Long]]'', starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. The film was well received by audiences and critics, with Roger Ebert awarding it 3 out of 4 stars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=A Love Song for Bobby Long Movie Review (2005) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-love-song-for-bobby-long-2005 |website=www.rogerebert.com |language=en}}</ref> The film also earned Scarlett Johansson a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nAfter the credit crunch hit in 2008, Krevoy found new investors and ramped up production. He built a strong international sales team and began assembling an eclectic slate of programming.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Remaking of MPCA |url=https://www.screendaily.com/interviews/the-remaking-of-mpca/5033964.article |website=Screen |language=en}}</ref>\n\nKrevoy produced the 2009 war drama ''[[Taking Chance]]'', based on the true experiences of Lt. Colonel [[Michael Strobl]], who wrote about his time in the widely circulated article \u201cTaking Chance Home\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Taking Chance Home |url=http://www.blackfive.net/main/2004/04/taking_chance.html |website=BlackFive}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Ross Katz]] and starred [[Kevin Bacon]]. It was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] before premiering on [[HBO]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Taking Chance |url=https://www.hbo.com/movies/taking-chance |website=HBO |language=en}}</ref> The film was well received by critics who praised the apolitical stance of the film, as well as the discipline of the filmmakers to veer away from emotional sentimentality. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \u201cdoesn't miss a single emotional pressure point \u2013 Katz clearly believes in the power and necessity of catharsis.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNAMARA |first1=By MARY |title=Review: HBO's 'Taking Chance' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-taking-chance21-2009feb21-story.html |website=latimes.com}}</ref> ''Taking Chance'' received a total of 27 award nominations and 6 wins including Kevin Bacon for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television. The film was also nominated for a string of Primetime Emmy awards, as well as nominations in the SAG, PGA, DGA, ACE, ASC, and WGA awards. It also won the prestigious Humanitas Prize.\n\nKrevoy and MPCA produced a string of successful straight-to-DVD action movies. Four of these featured Academy Award winner, Cuba Gooding, Jr. These included ''[[Linewatch]]'' (2008); ''[[Hardwired (film)|Hardwired]]'' (2009), which also starred [[Val Kilmer]]; ''[[Ticking Clock]]'' (2011); and ''[[One in the Chamber]]'' (2012), which also featured 80's action star, [[Dolph Lundgren]]. They produced two movies with Academy Award Nominee, [[Samuel L. Jackson]]: ''[[Arena (2011 film)|Arena]]'' (2011); and ''[[Meeting Evil]]'' (2012). During this time MPCA also made two movies with action star [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] \u2013 ''[[Assassination Games]]'' (2011); and ''[[Six Bullets]]'' (2012).\n\nIn 2011, Krevoy made ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]'' for [[Disney]], a sequel to the 2008 hit comedy. Most of the original cast returned and the film did well in the home video market with sales of over $30 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 (2011) \u2013 Financial Information |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beverly-Hills-Chihuahua-2#tab=video-sales |website=The Numbers}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Krevoy and Stabler were executive producers on ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]'', the sequel to their original smash hit, taking place 20 years after the events of the first film. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey reprised their roles and the film was released on November 14, 2014. It opened at number one in the U.S. box office charts to $36 million for the weekend. It then went on to make $169 million worldwide and was a very strong release on home video.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dumb and Dumber To (2014) \u2013 Box Office Mojo |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dumberto.htm |website=www.boxofficemojo.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Christmas and Family Movies (2013\u2013present)==\n\nRecently, Krevoy has become a world-leading producer of Christmas and family-themed entertainment. Since 2013, Krevoy and MPCA have produced more than 40 original Christmas and family movies for select broadcasters, including [[Netflix]] and [[The Hallmark Channel]]. Produced in tax-efficient and low-cost production centers like Vancouver and Northern Ontario, Canada, and Bucharest, Romania, with the highest production quality at the lowest possible budget, compelling storytelling, and award-winning directors and writers, these films have broken numerous records for the networks on which they've aired.

Krevoy saw that \u201cRoger knew all aspects of his profession, from development to the actual filmmaking, to post-production and marketing,\" and that it \"really set him apart.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daily |first1=Investor's Business |title=Roger Corman Took A Fast And Furious Route To Hollywood Success {{!}} Investor's Business Daily |url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/roger-corman-took-a-fast-and-furious-route-to-hollywood-success/ |website=Investor's Business Daily |date=27 October 2016}}</ref> Krevoy made it a priority to align himself with talented creatives who showed great promise.\n\nHis persistence to remain as an independent producer has given Krevoy the ability to put his full trust in his creative partners. Corman taught him to allow a \u201ccreative person to do their best without interfering, to be supportive instead of a hindrance.\u201d In terms of studio interference, Krevoy is quoted as saying that \u201cThe studios, with their hordes of executives going through every page of the script and telling a director what to do, are the antithesis of a pure independent, who basically executes his particular vision.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=Emanuel |title=Cinema of Outsiders: the Rise of American Independent Film |date=2001 |publisher=New York Univ. Press |page=3}}</ref> Using this ethos, MPCA has remained as a fully independent studio for the last 30 years.\n\nAs was the case with ''Dumb and Dumber'', Krevoy has a knack of reenergizing projects and scripts that have been stuck in development hell. Krevoy says, \u201cthat most of my career triumphs have come from sniffing out originality in scripts, direction, or in young actors on their way up \u2014 sometimes in the unlikeliest of places.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpcafilm.com/veteran-television-and-film-producers-visit-casts-hope-for-creative-students/}}</ref>\n\nKrevoy is known for jumpstarting the careers of many young actors and filmmakers who have gone on to become some of the biggest names in Hollywood including the Farrelly brothers, [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Jude Law]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Ben Foster]], [[Gretchen Mol]], [[Wallace Wolodarsky]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=KRONKE |first1=DAVID |title=MOVIE REVIEW : 'Coldblooded' Shoots for Laughs With Off-the-Cuff Surrealism |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-15/entertainment/ca-46089_1_priestley-plays-cosmo |website=Los Angeles Times |date=15 September 1995}}</ref> and [[Jon Turteltaub]].\n\nA big focus of Krevoy's ethos is to look for specific niches of audiences that need content. The recent success of his Christmas movies further exemplifies his quick action to see an underfed audience. \u201cAny film that I\u2019ve ever had that\u2019s done big business, it was because I was trying to play the niches,\u201d says Krevoy. He cites ''Dumb and Dumber'' as such a broad, silly comedy that no established studio would dare to make it. Roger Corman taught him that \u201cyou really don\u2019t have to be the biggest or the best on the block. Do the best you can\u2026 if you\u2019re going to do a smaller film, be the best at the smaller film, and compete at your own level, that you\u2019re comfortable with.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wiesmann |first1=U.

producer, entrepreneur, and the founder and Chairman/[[CEO]] of the [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]] (MPCA). In a career spanning over 30 years, Krevoy has been directly involved in the development, finance, production, acquisition, and distribution of more than 100 motion picture and television projects, most famously the 1994 blockbuster comedy ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''. Lately, he has become known as one of the leading producers of Christmas themed entertainment, having produced many successful holiday movies, including Netflix\u2019s ''[[A Christmas Prince]]'' trilogy, and ''[[The Princess Switch]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Netflix's 'A Christmas Prince' Is Just the Start of the Streaming Giant's Quest for Christmas Dominance |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/netflix-a-christmas-prince-christmas-streaming-takeover-hallmark-1201908222/}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nKrevoy graduated from [[Beverly Hills High School]]. He went on to study at [[Stanford University]], graduating in 1978 with a BA in Political Science. To this day he still maintains a strong connection to the university. He then went on to study at [[UC Hastings]], College of the Law. After graduation, he served as a Legislative Fellow in the California State Legislature and worked as an entertainment attorney at a prominent Los Angeles law firm.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brad Krevoy Bio |url=http://www.mpcafilm.com/bios/}}</ref>\n\n==Early career and work with Roger Corman (1983\u20131986)==\n\nKrevoy's major entry into the film industry came from a chance encounter with [[Roger Corman]] at a Stanford football game in 1983. The two discussed the promising new home video market and two days later Brad was working for Corman's Concorde-New Horizon pictures, handling the business affairs.\n\nKrevoy's role was initially to look for new opportunities and sources of funding. His interest in the home video market paid off with Concorde quickly becoming one of the largest suppliers of VHS tapes, having deals in place with every major distributor in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brad Krevoy: Dumb (and Dumber) like a Fox |url=https://beverlygray.blogspot.com/2014/11/brad-krevoy-dumb-and-dumber-like-fox.html}}</ref>\n \n==MPCA (1986\u20131996)==\n\nIn 1986, Krevoy and his longtime business partner Steve Stabler co-founded Motion Picture Corporation of America (MPCA). The goal of the company was to focus on producing, acquiring and distributing commercial motion picture and television productions. Using the skills he learned during his time with Roger Corman, Krevoy managed to position MPCA as one of the largest suppliers of high-quality, lower-budget films.\n\nDuring the company's formative years, they produced a few cult favorites, including ''[[The Purple People Eater]]'' (1988) with [[Ned Beatty]]; ''Back to Back'' (1989), starring [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Apollonia Kotero|Apollonia]]; and the sex comedy ''[[Miracle Beach]]'' (1992).\n\n==Dumb and Dumber==\n\nKrevoy and Stabler took the company to new heights when they released the 1994 blockbuster comedy ''Dumb and Dumber''. The script had been around for nearly seven years and was rejected by every major studio. The writers, [[Bobby Farrelly|Bobby]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], desperately wanted to direct the feature as well, but no one would give them a shot. Once Krevoy and MPCA got behind the script, they were able to package the project, complete with the Farrellys directing and then rising star, [[Jim Carrey]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Lloyd |title=Produce Your Own Damn Movie! |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0240810454 |page=223|year=2009 }}</ref>\n\n''Dumb and Dumber'' broke box office comedy records; it also opened and remained at number 1 on the U.S. box office for 4 straight weeks over the holiday season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dumb and Dumber Weekend |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=dumbanddumber.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film went on to gross $127 million domestically and $120 million overseas for a worldwide total of $247 million off of a $16 million budget.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dumb and Dumber |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=dumbanddumber.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> The film was one of the highest grossing comedies of the 90's. Combined with its ancillary and video sales, the film is estimated to have grossed over half a billion dollars.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=Lloyd |title=Produce Your Own Damn Movie! |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0240810454 |page=223|year=2009 }}</ref>\n\n''Dumb and Dumber'' propelled the Farrellys' directing career; they became known as the top comedy directors of the time. Krevoy was able to use this success to get the Farrellys' passion project, ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'', off the ground. It was released in June 1996, starring [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Randy Quaid]] and [[Bill Murray]]. Despite many critics praising the film, it was a commercial disappointment, grossing only $27 million against a $25 million budget over the course of its theatrical run.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingpin |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kingpin.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] championed the film and gave it 3 and a half stars out 4, praising the film's daring comedy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kingpin Review |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kingpin-1996 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> ''Kingpin'' became a huge release on home video, finding a dedicated and passionate cult following.<ref>{{cite web |title='Kingpin': The Farrelly Brothers' Biggest Flop and Greatest Triumph |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/ |website=Vulture.com |access-date=2018-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520142417/http://splitsider.com/2012/04/kingpin-the-farrelly-brothers-biggest-flop-and-greatest-triumph/ |archive-date=2014-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nKrevoy and MPCA expanded on their success and went on to produce more big-budget studio comedies, including ''[[Beverly Hills Ninja]]'' starring [[Chris Farley]] and ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'' with [[Tim Allen]]. They also produced ''[[Threesome]]'', starring [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]]. The film was one of the most successful independent arthouse films of the year, grossing just under $15 million domestically.<ref>{{cite web |title=Threesome (1994) \u2013 Box Office Mojo |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=threesome.htm |website=www.boxofficemojo.com |language=en}}</ref> ''Threesome'' was an autobiographical comedy by writer and director, [[Andrew Fleming]]. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, praising the film's honest characterization and strong dialogue.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Threesome Movie Review & Film Summary (1994) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/threesome-1994 |website=www.rogerebert.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==First-look deals==\n\nStarting in November 1995, until they were acquired by Metromedia International Group in 1996, Krevoy and MPCA had a first-look producing deal with [[Paramount Studios]]. Krevoy and MPCA also signed a first-look deal with Sony Pictures in the late 90s, where they produced more than 10 movies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paramount gets first look at MPCA |url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/par-gets-first-look-at-mpca-99129209/ |website=Variety |date=6 November 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Co-president of Orion Pictures (1996\u20131998)==\n\nIn 1996, MPCA was purchased by John Kluge's Metromedia International Group. Metromedia had just purchased the independent production company Orion Pictures from chapter 11 bankruptcy. When MPCA was merged into the company, Krevoy and Stabler took over as the Co-President's of [[Orion Pictures]] and were given a six-picture deal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Horn |first1=John |title=Coming soon, to very few theaters |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/21/entertainment/et-mgm21 |website=Los Angeles Times |date=21 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt Orion, Krevoy oversaw the production, acquisition, and distribution of Orion's motion picture and television programming. He produced films for Academy Award-winner Tom Schulman (''[[Dead Poets Society]]'') and released films such as 1997's Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, ''[[Prisoner of the Mountains]]'' (directed by [[Sergei Bodrov]]), and the acclaimed ''[[Ulee's Gold]]'' (directed by [[Victor Nunez]] and presented by [[Jonathan Demme]]). ''Ulee\u2019s Gold'' was a critical hit and won its leading actor, [[Peter Fonda]], his first and only Golden Globe for best actor. Fonda also received his first and only Oscar nomination for best actor.\n\nAfter two years of revitalizing Orion Pictures, Metromedia went on to sell Orion to MGM. Krevoy was able to take the MPCA name back as part of his original deal.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weiner |first1=Rex |title=MGM ends Orion orbit |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/mgm-ends-orion-orbit-1116676950/ |website=Variety |date=11 July 1997}}</ref>\n \n==Restarting MPCA (1998\u20132014)==\n\nIn 1998, Krevoy returned to his independent filmmaking roots and restarted MPCA with a distribution deal through MGM.\n\nSince rebooting MPCA, Krevoy has produced a wide array of motion pictures including: boxing drama ''[[Joe and Max]]'' (which collected both [[ESPN]] and [[ACE Awards|ACE]] award nominations); the 2002 Sundance premiere ''[[Bookies]]'' (for director [[Mark Illsley]] of ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]'' fame); and ''[[Boat Trip (film)|Boat Trip]]'' starring Academy Award-winner [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Horatio Sanz]], [[Vivica A. Fox]], and [[Roger Moore]] for Artisan/[[Lionsgate]].\n\nIn 2004 Krevoy produced the drama, ''[[A Love Song for Bobby Long]]'', starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. The film was well received by audiences and critics, with Roger Ebert awarding it 3 out of 4 stars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=A Love Song for Bobby Long Movie Review (2005) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-love-song-for-bobby-long-2005 |website=www.rogerebert.com |language=en}}</ref> The film also earned Scarlett Johansson a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nAfter the credit crunch hit in 2008, Krevoy found new investors and ramped up production. He built a strong international sales team and began assembling an eclectic slate of programming.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Remaking of MPCA |url=https://www.screendaily.com/interviews/the-remaking-of-mpca/5033964.article |website=Screen |language=en}}</ref>\n\nKrevoy produced the 2009 war drama ''[[Taking Chance]]'', based on the true experiences of Lt. Colonel [[Michael Strobl]], who wrote about his time in the widely circulated article \u201cTaking Chance Home\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Taking Chance Home |url=http://www.blackfive.net/main/2004/04/taking_chance.html |website=BlackFive}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Ross Katz]] and starred [[Kevin Bacon]]. It was shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] before premiering on [[HBO]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Taking Chance |url=https://www.hbo.com/movies/taking-chance |website=HBO |language=en}}</ref> The film was well received by critics who praised the apolitical stance of the film, as well as the discipline of the filmmakers to veer away from emotional sentimentality. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \u201cdoesn't miss a single emotional pressure point \u2013 Katz clearly believes in the power and necessity of catharsis.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNAMARA |first1=By MARY |title=Review: HBO's 'Taking Chance' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-taking-chance21-2009feb21-story.html |website=latimes.com}}</ref> ''Taking Chance'' received a total of 27 award nominations and 6 wins including Kevin Bacon for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television. The film was also nominated for a string of Primetime Emmy awards, as well as nominations in the SAG, PGA, DGA, ACE, ASC, and WGA awards. It also won the prestigious Humanitas Prize.\n\nKrevoy and MPCA produced a string of successful straight-to-DVD action movies. Four of these featured Academy Award winner, Cuba Gooding, Jr. These included ''[[Linewatch]]'' (2008); ''[[Hardwired (film)|Hardwired]]'' (2009), which also starred [[Val Kilmer]]; ''[[Ticking Clock]]'' (2011); and ''[[One in the Chamber]]'' (2012), which also featured 80's action star, [[Dolph Lundgren]]. They produced two movies with Academy Award Nominee, [[Samuel L. Jackson]]: ''[[Arena (2011 film)|Arena]]'' (2011); and ''[[Meeting Evil]]'' (2012). During this time MPCA also made two movies with action star [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] \u2013 ''[[Assassination Games]]'' (2011); and ''[[Six Bullets]]'' (2012).\n\nIn 2011, Krevoy made ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2]]'' for [[Disney]], a sequel to the 2008 hit comedy. Most of the original cast returned and the film did well in the home video market with sales of over $30 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 (2011) \u2013 Financial Information |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Beverly-Hills-Chihuahua-2#tab=video-sales |website=The Numbers}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Krevoy and Stabler were executive producers on ''[[Dumb and Dumber To]]'', the sequel to their original smash hit, taking place 20 years after the events of the first film. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey reprised their roles and the film was released on November 14, 2014. It opened at number one in the U.S. box office charts to $36 million for the weekend. It then went on to make $169 million worldwide and was a very strong release on home video.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dumb and Dumber To (2014) \u2013 Box Office Mojo |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dumberto.htm |website=www.boxofficemojo.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Christmas and Family Movies (2013\u2013present)==\n\nRecently, Krevoy has become a world-leading producer of Christmas and family-themed entertainment. Since 2013, Krevoy and MPCA have produced more than 40 original Christmas and family movies for select broadcasters, including [[Netflix]] and [[The Hallmark Channel]]. Produced in tax-efficient and low-cost production centers like Vancouver and Northern Ontario, Canada, and Bucharest, Romania, with the highest production quality at the lowest possible budget, compelling storytelling, and award-winning directors and writers, these films have broken numerous records for the networks on which they've aired.

Krevoy saw that \u201cRoger knew all aspects of his profession, from development to the actual filmmaking, to post-production and marketing,\" and that it \"really set him apart.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daily |first1=Investor's Business |title=Roger Corman Took A Fast And Furious Route To Hollywood Success {{!}} Investor's Business Daily |url=https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/roger-corman-took-a-fast-and-furious-route-to-hollywood-success/ |website=Investor's Business Daily |date=27 October 2016}}</ref> Krevoy made it a priority to align himself with talented creatives who showed great promise.\n\nHis persistence to remain as an independent producer has given Krevoy the ability to put his full trust in his creative partners. Corman taught him to allow a \u201ccreative person to do their best without interfering, to be supportive instead of a hindrance.\u201d In terms of studio interference, Krevoy is quoted as saying that \u201cThe studios, with their hordes of executives going through every page of the script and telling a director what to do, are the antithesis of a pure independent, who basically executes his particular vision.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levy |first1=Emanuel |title=Cinema of Outsiders: the Rise of American Independent Film |date=2001 |publisher=New York Univ. Press |page=3}}</ref> Using this ethos, MPCA has remained as a fully independent studio for the last 30 years.\n\nAs was the case with ''Dumb and Dumber'', Krevoy has a knack of reenergizing projects and scripts that have been stuck in development hell. Krevoy says, \u201cthat most of my career triumphs have come from sniffing out originality in scripts, direction, or in young actors on their way up \u2014 sometimes in the unlikeliest of places.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpcafilm.com/veteran-television-and-film-producers-visit-casts-hope-for-creative-students/}}</ref>\n\nKrevoy is known for jumpstarting the careers of many young actors and filmmakers who have gone on to become some of the biggest names in Hollywood including the Farrelly brothers, [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Jude Law]], [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Ben Foster]], [[Gretchen Mol]], [[Wallace Wolodarsky]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=KRONKE |first1=DAVID |title=MOVIE REVIEW : 'Coldblooded' Shoots for Laughs With Off-the-Cuff Surrealism |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-15/entertainment/ca-46089_1_priestley-plays-cosmo |website=Los Angeles Times |date=15 September 1995}}</ref> and [[Jon Turteltaub]].\n\nA big focus of Krevoy's ethos is to look for specific niches of audiences that need content. The recent success of his Christmas movies further exemplifies his quick action to see an underfed audience. \u201cAny film that I\u2019ve ever had that\u2019s done big business, it was because I was trying to play the niches,\u201d says Krevoy. He cites ''Dumb and Dumber'' as such a broad, silly comedy that no established studio would dare to make it. Roger Corman taught him that \u201cyou really don\u2019t have to be the biggest or the best on the block. Do the best you can\u2026 if you\u2019re going to do a smaller film, be the best at the smaller film, and compete at your own level, that you\u2019re comfortable with.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wiesmann |first1=U.

{"title_page": "Complementary currency", "text_new": "A '''complementary currency''' is a [[currency]] or [[medium of exchange]] that is not necessarily a national currency, but that is thought of as supplementing or complementing national currencies.{{r|\"ccto\"|page=3}}{{r|ccg2006|page=2}}  Complementary currencies are usually not [[legal tender]] and their use is  based on agreement between the parties exchanging the currency. According to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Blanc of Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie de la Firme et des Institutions, complementary currencies aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy.{{r|cc|page=7}} They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals.{{r|hal|page=4}}\n\nWhen speaking about complementary currencies, a number of overlapping and often interchangeable terms are in use: [[Local currency|local]] or [[Community currency|community]] currencies are complementary currencies used within a locality or other form of community (such as business-based or online communities); regional currencies are similar to local currencies, but are used within a larger geographical region; and [[sectoral currency|sectoral]] currencies are complementary currencies used within a single economic sector, such as education or health care. Many [[private currencies]] are complementary currencies issued by private businesses or organizations. Other terms include '''alternative currency''', [[auxiliary currencies|auxiliary currency]], and microcurrency. [[Mutual credit]] is a form of alternative currency, and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency. [[Barter]]s are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which trade only items, without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, [[Local Exchange Trading Systems|LETS]] is a special form of barter that trades points for items. One point stands for one worker-hour of work, and is thus a [[Time-based currency]].\n\n==Purposes==\nCurrent complementary currencies have often been designed intentionally to address specific issues, for example to increase financial stability.{{r|crisis}} Most complementary currencies have multiple purposes and/or are intended to address multiple issues. They can be useful for communities that do not have access to financial capital, and for adjusting peoples' spending behavior.{{r|boot}} The 2006 Annual Report of the Worldwide Database of Complementary Currency Systems presented a survey of 150 complementary currency systems in which 94 respondents said that \"all reasons\" were selected, among cooperation, micro/small/medium enterprise development, activating the local market, reducing the need for national currency, and community development.{{r|\"DeMeulenaere\"}}\n\nAims may include:\n* lifeboat currencies{{Technical statement|date=November 2019}}\n* to increase financial stability{{r|crisis}}\n* to reduce carbon emissions, by encouraging localisation of trade and relationships\n* to encouraging use of under-used resources{{r|ccg2006|page=2}}\n* to recognise the informal economy\n* promote local businesses\n\n===Advantages===\nSome alternative currencies devalue rapidly (they are called Schwundgeld); this increases monetary circulation. The [[Miracle of W\u00f6rgl]] is an event that showed the potential of this increased spending through the introduction of a local currency known as [[Freigeld]]. Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the [[money]] always keeps circulating locally, benefiting only the local economy.\n\nAlternative currencies are reported to work as a counterbalance for the local economy. They increase in activity if the local economy slows down, and decrease in activity if the local economy goes up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stodder|first=James|title=Implications for Macroeconomic Stability|url=http://www.lietaer.com/images/Stodder_Reciprocal_Exchange.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=January 2005}}</ref>{{Dubious|No mention of alternative currency|reason=No mention of alternative currency|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs a commercial tool within a business, as opposed to a geographical social tool, a complementary currency can open a business up to a preferred source marketplace whereby they can sell their otherwise devalued or worthless spare capacity in exchange for the complementary currency. By selling their spare capacity (empty hotel rooms / under utilised staff hours / blank diary slots / excess stock) the business is able to harness the otherwise lost value gaining some key benefits such as :- Improved profits; stronger balance sheet; enhanced cash flow; more customers and a growth in market share.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nAlternative currencies promoted as [[local currencies]] which cannot be spent outside the community have limited use.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAccording to professor Nikolaus L\u00e4ufer theory, the use of local currencies such as Freigeld can only increase economic activity temporarily. Lengthy use of a local currency will ultimately result in a decline in economic activity and lead to a destabilization of the economy. This is due to the increased circulation velocity of the money as the amount in circulation decreases (as currencies as Freigeld reduce in value rapidly).<ref>{{cite web|last=L\u00e4ufer|first=Nikolaus|title=Natural Economic Order Theories or Freiwirtschaftslehre (Silvio Gesell)|url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/wiwi/laufer/main.html#FREI|publisher=University of Konstanz|accessdate=3 April 2014||date= 31 December 2006|language=German}}</ref>{{ clarify | date = June 2015 | reason = More specific link required}}\n\n==Tax==\n{{Expand section|section=2|date=May 2019}}\nOften there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax-status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\n==Types==\nComplementary currencies describe a wide group of exchange systems, currencies or [[scrip]]s designed to be used in combination with standard currencies or other complementary currencies. They can be valued and exchanged in relationship to national currencies but also function as [[Medium of exchange|media of exchange]] on their own. Complementary currencies lie outside the nationally defined legal realm of [[legal tender]] and are not used as such. Rate of exchange, scope of circulation and use in combination with other currencies differs greatly between complementary currency systems, as is the case with national currency systems.\n\n[[File:Freigeld1.jpg|thumb|One [[W\u00f6rgl]] Schilling note with [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] stamps]]\nSome complementary currencies incorporate value scales based on time or the backing of real resources (gold, oil, services, etc.). A [[time-based currency]] is valued by the time required to perform a service in hours, notwithstanding the potential market value of the service. Another type of complementary monetary systems is the barter, an exchange of specific goods or services is performed without the use of any currency.\n\nIn 1982, the most widespread auxiliary currency system, the [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]], was created. It regulates the exchange of goods and services between the members of the cooperative. Examples for an investment system of complementary currency are the Automatic Social Financial Network (ASFN) and the international [[crowdsourcing]] and [[crowd-funding]] community Evolution RA<ref>http://asfn.info/en/</ref> whose members use their own complementary virtual currency \"\u0421yber-gold\". The introductory fee paid by the new association members is subsequently directed toward investments in a variety of commercial projects.\n\nSome complementary currencies take advantage of [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] fees, an intentional devaluation of the currency over time, like negative [[interest]]. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value-holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc., all of which are sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.\n\nOther experimental complementary currencies use high interest fees to promote heavy competition between participants, and the removal of wealth from long term wealth holding structures (natural/material wealth, property, etc.) to aid in the process of rapid industrialization, mass production, automation and competitive innovation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nMonetary speculation and gambling are usually outside the design parameters of complementary currencies. Complementary currencies are often intentionally restricted in their regional spread, time of validity or sector of use and may require a membership of participating individuals or points of acceptance.\n\nThere are some complementary currencies that are regional or global, such as the [[Community Exchange System]], [[WIR]] and Friendly Favors, Tibex in the [[Lazio]] region in Italy or the proposed global currency [[Terra (currency)|terra]].{{r|rietaer}}\n\nA [[community currency]] is a type of complementary currency that has the explicit aim to support and build more equal, connected and sustainable societies. A community currency is designed to be used by a specific group.{{r|CCIA}}\n\n==Activists==\nSome complementary currency activists are Belgian ex-banker [[Bernard Lietaer]], British economist Hazel Henderson, Dutch STRO-director [[Henk van Arkel]] that developed [[Cyclos]], [[Qoin]] initiators [[Edgar Kampers]] and [[Rob van Hilten]], [[Paul Glover (activist)|Paul Glover]] of Ithaca HOURS, [[Margrit Kennedy]] from Monneta, [[Local exchange trading system|LETSystem]] inventor [[Michael Linton]], [[Time Banking]] inventor [[Edgar S. Cahn]], [[Complementary Currency Resource Center]] coordinator [[Stephen DeMeulenaere]] and many others. Lietaer has argued that the world's national currencies are inadequate for the world's business needs, citing how 87 countries have experienced major currency crashes over a 20-year period, and arguing for complementary currencies as a way to protect against these problems.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21825746_ITM \"Bernard Lietaer Urges the Growth of New

According to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Blanc of Laboratoire d'\u00c9conomie de la Firme et des Institutions, complementary currencies aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy.{{r|cc|page=7}} They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals.{{r|hal|page=4}}\n\nWhen speaking about complementary currencies, a number of overlapping and often interchangeable terms are in use: [[Local currency|local]] or [[Community currency|community]] currencies are complementary currencies used within a locality or other form of community (such as business-based or online communities); regional currencies are similar to local currencies, but are used within a larger geographical region; and [[sectoral currency|sectoral]] currencies are complementary currencies used within a single economic sector, such as education or health care. Many [[private currencies]] are complementary currencies issued by private businesses or organizations. Other terms include '''alternative currency''', [[auxiliary currencies|auxiliary currency]], and microcurrency. [[Mutual credit]] is a form of alternative currency, and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency. [[Barter]]s are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which trade only items, without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, [[Local Exchange Trading Systems|LETS]] is a special form of barter that trades points for items. One point stands for one worker-hour of work, and is thus a [[Time-based currency]].\n\n==Purposes==\nCurrent complementary currencies have often been designed intentionally to address specific issues, for example to increase financial stability.{{r|crisis}} Most complementary currencies have multiple purposes and/or are intended to address multiple issues. They can be useful for communities that do not have access to financial capital, and for adjusting peoples' spending behavior.{{r|boot}} The 2006 Annual Report of the Worldwide Database of Complementary Currency Systems presented a survey of 150 complementary currency systems in which 94 respondents said that \"all reasons\" were selected, among cooperation, micro/small/medium enterprise development, activating the local market, reducing the need for national currency, and community development.{{r|\"DeMeulenaere\"}}\n\nAims may include:\n* lifeboat currencies{{Technical statement|date=November 2019}}\n* to increase financial stability{{r|crisis}}\n* to reduce carbon emissions, by encouraging localisation of trade and relationships\n* to encouraging use of under-used resources{{r|ccg2006|page=2}}\n* to recognise the informal economy\n* promote local businesses\n\n===Advantages===\nSome alternative currencies devalue rapidly (they are called Schwundgeld); this increases monetary circulation. The [[Miracle of W\u00f6rgl]] is an event that showed the potential of this increased spending through the introduction of a local currency known as [[Freigeld]]. Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the [[money]] always keeps circulating locally, benefiting only the local economy.\n\nAlternative currencies are reported to work as a counterbalance for the local economy. They increase in activity if the local economy slows down, and decrease in activity if the local economy goes up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stodder|first=James|title=Implications for Macroeconomic Stability|url=http://www.lietaer.com/images/Stodder_Reciprocal_Exchange.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2014|date=January 2005}}</ref>{{Dubious|No mention of alternative currency|reason=No mention of alternative currency|date=June 2015}}\n\nAs a commercial tool within a business, as opposed to a geographical social tool, a complementary currency can open a business up to a preferred source marketplace whereby they can sell their otherwise devalued or worthless spare capacity in exchange for the complementary currency. By selling their spare capacity (empty hotel rooms / under utilised staff hours / blank diary slots / excess stock) the business is able to harness the otherwise lost value gaining some key benefits such as :- Improved profits; stronger balance sheet; enhanced cash flow; more customers and a growth in market share.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nAlternative currencies promoted as [[local currencies]] which cannot be spent outside the community have limited use.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAccording to professor Nikolaus L\u00e4ufer, the use of local currencies such as Freigeld can only increase economic activity temporarily. Lengthy use of a local currency will ultimately result in a decline in economic activity and lead to a destabilization of the economy. This is due to the increased circulation velocity of the money as the amount in circulation decreases (as currencies as Freigeld reduce in value rapidly).<ref>{{cite web|last=L\u00e4ufer|first=Nikolaus|title=Natural Economic Order Theories or Freiwirtschaftslehre (Silvio Gesell)|url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/wiwi/laufer/main.html#FREI|publisher=University of Konstanz|accessdate=3 April 2014||date= 31 December 2006|language=German}}</ref>{{ clarify | date = June 2015 | reason = More specific link required}}\n\n==Tax==\n{{Expand section|section=2|date=May 2019}}\nOften there are issues related to paying [[tax]]. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax-status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\n==Types==\nComplementary currencies describe a wide group of exchange systems, currencies or [[scrip]]s designed to be used in combination with standard currencies or other complementary currencies. They can be valued and exchanged in relationship to national currencies but also function as [[Medium of exchange|media of exchange]] on their own. Complementary currencies lie outside the nationally defined legal realm of [[legal tender]] and are not used as such. Rate of exchange, scope of circulation and use in combination with other currencies differs greatly between complementary currency systems, as is the case with national currency systems.\n\n[[File:Freigeld1.jpg|thumb|One [[W\u00f6rgl]] Schilling note with [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] stamps]]\nSome complementary currencies incorporate value scales based on time or the backing of real resources (gold, oil, services, etc.). A [[time-based currency]] is valued by the time required to perform a service in hours, notwithstanding the potential market value of the service. Another type of complementary monetary systems is the barter, an exchange of specific goods or services is performed without the use of any currency.\n\nIn 1982, the most widespread auxiliary currency system, the [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]], was created. It regulates the exchange of goods and services between the members of the cooperative. Examples for an investment system of complementary currency are the Automatic Social Financial Network (ASFN) and the international [[crowdsourcing]] and [[crowd-funding]] community Evolution RA<ref>http://asfn.info/en/</ref> whose members use their own complementary virtual currency \"\u0421yber-gold\". The introductory fee paid by the new association members is subsequently directed toward investments in a variety of commercial projects.\n\nSome complementary currencies take advantage of [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]] fees, an intentional devaluation of the currency over time, like negative [[interest]]. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value-holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc., all of which are sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.\n\nOther experimental complementary currencies use high interest fees to promote heavy competition between participants, and the removal of wealth from long term wealth holding structures (natural/material wealth, property, etc.) to aid in the process of rapid industrialization, mass production, automation and competitive innovation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nMonetary speculation and gambling are usually outside the design parameters of complementary currencies. Complementary currencies are often intentionally restricted in their regional spread, time of validity or sector of use and may require a membership of participating individuals or points of acceptance.\n\nThere are some complementary currencies that are regional or global, such as the [[Community Exchange System]], [[WIR]] and Friendly Favors, Tibex in the [[Lazio]] region in Italy or the proposed global currency [[Terra (currency)|terra]].{{r|rietaer}}\n\nA [[community currency]] is a type of complementary currency that has the explicit aim to support and build more equal, connected and sustainable societies. A community currency is designed to be used by a specific group.{{r|CCIA}}\n\n==Activists==\nSome complementary currency activists are Belgian ex-banker [[Bernard Lietaer]], British economist Hazel Henderson, Dutch STRO-director [[Henk van Arkel]] that developed [[Cyclos]], [[Qoin]] initiators [[Edgar Kampers]] and [[Rob van Hilten]], [[Paul Glover (activist)|Paul Glover]] of Ithaca HOURS, [[Margrit Kennedy]] from Monneta, [[Local exchange trading system|LETSystem]] inventor [[Michael Linton]], [[Time Banking]] inventor [[Edgar S. Cahn]], [[Complementary Currency Resource Center]] coordinator [[Stephen DeMeulenaere]] and many others. Lietaer has argued that the world's national currencies are inadequate for the world's business needs, citing how 87 countries have experienced major currency crashes over a 20-year period, and arguing for complementary currencies as a way to protect against these problems.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21825746_ITM \"Bernard Lietaer Urges the Growth of New

Later, the MVC pattern became popular with Java developers when WebObjects was ported to [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

The introduction of the frameworks [[Django (web framework)|Django]] (July 2005, for [[Python (programming language)|Python]]) and [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]] (December 2005, for [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]), both of which had a strong emphasis on rapid deployment, increased MVC's popularity outside the traditional enterprise environment in which it has long been popular. MVC [[web framework]]s now hold large market-shares relative to non-MVC web [[Wt (web toolkit)|toolkits]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Use in web applications==\nAlthough originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as a design for [[World Wide Web]] applications in major [[programming language]]s. Several [[web framework]]s have been created that enforce the pattern. These [[software framework]]s vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the [[client\u2013server model|client and server]].<ref name=\"leff\">{{cite conference|first1=Avraham|last1=Leff|first2=James T.|last2=Rayfield|title=Web-Application Development Using the Model/View/Controller Design Pattern|date=September 2001|conference=IEEE Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference|pages=118\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nSome web MVC frameworks take a [[thin client]] approach that places almost the entire model, view and controller logic on the server. This is reflected in frameworks such as [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]] and [[ASP.NET MVC]]. In this approach, the client sends either [[hyperlink]] requests or [[form (web)|form]] submissions to the controller and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on the server.<ref name=\"leff\"/> Other frameworks such as [[AngularJS]], [[Ember.js|EmberJS]], [[JavaScriptMVC]] and [[Backbone.js|Backbone]] allow the MVC components to execute partly on the client (also see [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]).{{fact|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Goals of MVC==\n{{original-research|section|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Simultaneous development===\nBecause MVC decouples the various components of an application, developers are able to work in parallel on different components without affecting or blocking one another. For example, a team might divide their developers between the front-end and the back-end. The back-end developers can design the structure of the data and how the user interacts with it without requiring the user interface to be completed. Conversely, the front-end developers are able to design and test the layout of the application prior to the data structure being available.\n\n===Code reuse===\n\nThe same (or similar) view for one application can be refactored for another application with different data because the view is simply handling how the data is being displayed to the user. Unfortunately this does not work when that code is also useful for handling user input. For example, DOM code (including the application's custom abstractions to it) is useful for both graphics display and user input. (Note that, despite the name [[Document Object Model|''Document Object Model'',]] the DOM is actually not an MVC model, because it is the application's interface to the user).\n\nTo address these problems, MVC (and patterns like it) are often combined with a ''component architecture'' that provides a set of UI elements. Each UI element is a single higher-level ''component'' that combines the 3 required MVC components into a single package. By creating these higher-level components that are independent of each other, developers are able to reuse components quickly and easily in other applications.\n\n==Advantages & disadvantages==\n===Advantages===\n* ''Simultaneous development'' \u2013 Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views.\n* ''[[Cohesion (computer science)|High cohesion]]'' \u2013 MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together.\n* ''[[Loose coupling]]'' \u2013 The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling among models, views or controllers\n* ''Ease of modification'' \u2013 Because of the separation of responsibilities, future development or modification is easier\n* ''Multiple views for a model'' \u2013 Models can have multiple views\n\n===Disadvantages===\nThe disadvantages of MVC can be generally categorized as overhead for incorrectly factored software.\n* ''Code navigability'' \u2013 The framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of indirection and requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC.\n* ''Multi-artifact consistency'' \u2013 Decomposing a feature into three artifacts causes scattering. Thus, requiring developers to maintain the consistency of multiple representations at once.\n* ''Undermined by inevitable clustering'' \u2013 Applications tend to have heavy interaction between what the user sees and what the user uses. Therefore each feature's computation and state tends to get clustered into one of the 3 program parts, erasing the purported advantages of MVC.\n* ''Excessive boilerplate'' \u2013 Due to the application computation and state being typically clustered into one of the 3 parts, the other parts degenerate into either boilerplate shims or ''code-behind''<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Model-View-Controller dead on the front end?|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/is-mvc-dead-for-the-frontend-35b4d1fe39ec|date=2016-10-09}}</ref> that exists only to satisfy the MVC pattern.\n* ''Pronounced learning curve'' \u2013 Knowledge on multiple technologies becomes the norm. Developers using MVC need to be skilled in multiple technologies.\n* ''Lack of incremental benefit'' \u2013 UI applications are already factored into components, and achieving code reuse and independence via the component architecture, leaving no incremental benefit to MVC.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Multitier architecture]]\n* [[Hierarchical model\u2013view\u2013controller]]\n* [[Model\u2013view\u2013adapter]]\n* [[Model\u2013view\u2013presenter]]\n* [[Model\u2013view\u2013viewmodel]]\n* [[Entity-control-boundary|Entity-Control-Boundary pattern]]\n* [[Presentation\u2013abstraction\u2013control]]\n* [[Action\u2013Domain\u2013Responder|Action\u2013domain\u2013responder]]\n* [[Observer pattern]]\n* [[Separation of concerns]]\n* [[Strategy pattern]]\n* [[Naked objects]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Wikibooks|Computer Science Design Patterns/Model\u2013view\u2013controller}}\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Design Patterns patterns}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Model-view-controller}}\n[[Category:Software design patterns]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|software design pattern}}\n[[File:MVC-Process.svg|right|200px|thumb|Diagram of interactions within the MVC pattern.]]\n\n'''Model\u2013view\u2013controller''' (usually known as MVC) is a [[Software design|software design pattern]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_TH-Y78tt4&t=1667</ref> commonly used for developing [[user interface]]s which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

MVC [[web framework]]s now hold large market-shares relative to non-MVC web [[Wt (web toolkit)|toolkits]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Use in web applications==\nAlthough originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as a design for [[World Wide Web]] applications in major [[programming language]]s. Several [[web framework]]s have been created that enforce the pattern. These [[software framework]]s vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the [[client\u2013server model|client and server]].<ref name=\"leff\">{{cite conference|first1=Avraham|last1=Leff|first2=James T.|last2=Rayfield|title=Web-Application Development Using the Model/View/Controller Design Pattern|date=September 2001|conference=IEEE Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference|pages=118\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nSome web MVC frameworks take a [[thin client]] approach that places almost the entire model, view and controller logic on the server. This is reflected in frameworks such as [[Django (web framework)|Django]], [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]] and [[ASP.NET MVC]]. In this approach, the client sends either [[hyperlink]] requests or [[form (web)|form]] submissions to the controller and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on the server.<ref name=\"leff\"/> Other frameworks such as [[AngularJS]], [[Ember.js|EmberJS]], [[JavaScriptMVC]] and [[Backbone.js|Backbone]] allow the MVC components to execute partly on the client (also see [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]).{{fact|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Goals of MVC==\n{{original-research|section|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Simultaneous development===\nBecause MVC decouples the various components of an application, developers are able to work in parallel on different components without affecting or blocking one another. For example, a team might divide their developers between the front-end and the back-end. The back-end developers can design the structure of the data and how the user interacts with it without requiring the user interface to be completed. Conversely, the front-end developers are able to design and test the layout of the application prior to the data structure being available.\n\n===Code reuse===\n\nThe same (or similar) view for one application can be refactored for another application with different data because the view is simply handling how the data is being displayed to the user. Unfortunately this does not work when that code is also useful for handling user input. For example, DOM code (including the application's custom abstractions to it) is useful for both graphics display and user input. (Note that, despite the name ''Document Object Model'', the DOM is actually not an MVC model, because it is the application's interface to the user).\n\nTo address these problems, MVC (and patterns like it) are often combined with a ''component architecture'' that provides a set of UI elements. Each UI element is a single higher-level ''component'' that combines the 3 required MVC components into a single package. By creating these higher-level components that are independent of each other, developers are able to reuse components quickly and easily in other applications.\n\n==Advantages & disadvantages==\n===Advantages===\n* ''Simultaneous development'' \u2013 Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views.\n* ''[[Cohesion (computer science)|High cohesion]]'' \u2013 MVC enables logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together.\n* ''[[Loose coupling]]'' \u2013 The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling among models, views or controllers\n* ''Ease of modification'' \u2013 Because of the separation of responsibilities, future development or modification is easier\n* ''Multiple views for a model'' \u2013 Models can have multiple views\n\n===Disadvantages===\nThe disadvantages of MVC can be generally categorized as overhead for incorrectly factored software.\n* ''Code navigability'' \u2013 The framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of indirection and requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC.\n* ''Multi-artifact consistency'' \u2013 Decomposing a feature into three artifacts causes scattering. Thus, requiring developers to maintain the consistency of multiple representations at once.\n* ''Undermined by inevitable clustering'' \u2013 Applications tend to have heavy interaction between what the user sees and what the user uses. Therefore each feature's computation and state tends to get clustered into one of the 3 program parts, erasing the purported advantages of MVC.\n* ''Excessive boilerplate'' \u2013 Due to the application computation and state being typically clustered into one of the 3 parts, the other parts degenerate into either boilerplate shims or ''code-behind''<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Model-View-Controller dead on the front end?|url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/is-mvc-dead-for-the-frontend-35b4d1fe39ec|date=2016-10-09}}</ref> that exists only to satisfy the MVC pattern.\n* ''Pronounced learning curve'' \u2013 Knowledge on multiple technologies becomes the norm. Developers using MVC need to be skilled in multiple technologies.\n* ''Lack of incremental benefit'' \u2013 UI applications are already factored into components, and achieving code reuse and independence via the component architecture, leaving no incremental benefit to MVC.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Multitier architecture]]\n* [[Hierarchical model\u2013view\u2013controller]]\n* [[Model\u2013view\u2013adapter]]\n* [[Model\u2013view\u2013presenter]]\n* [[Model\u2013view\u2013viewmodel]]\n* [[Entity-control-boundary|Entity-Control-Boundary pattern]]\n* [[Presentation\u2013abstraction\u2013control]]\n* [[Action\u2013Domain\u2013Responder|Action\u2013domain\u2013responder]]\n* [[Observer pattern]]\n* [[Separation of concerns]]\n* [[Strategy pattern]]\n* [[Naked objects]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Wikibooks|Computer Science Design Patterns/Model\u2013view\u2013controller}}\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Design Patterns patterns}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Model-view-controller}}\n[[Category:Software design patterns]]\n", "name_user": "Textkyber", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added reference to DOM entry", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"}

Proverbs are often [[metaphor]]ical and use [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]]. Collectively, they form a [[folklore genre|genre of folklore]].\n\nSome proverbs exist in more than u one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures similar to theirs. In the West, the [[Bible]] (including, but not limited to the [[Book of Proverbs]]) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of [[Erasmus]]) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the \"major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,\"<ref>p. 12, Wolfgang Mieder. 1990. ''Not by bread alone: Proverbs of the Bible''. New England Press.</ref> whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, eleven are from the Bible.<ref>Paczolay, Gyula. 1997. ''European Proverbs in 55 Languages''. Veszpre'm, Hungary.</ref> However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.\n\n== Definitions ==\n[[Lord John Russell]] (c. 1850) observed poetically that a \"proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many.\"<ref>p. 25. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. \"The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age'' 3-40. Oxford University Press.</ref> But giving the word \"proverb\" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote [[Archer Taylor]]'s argument that formulating a scientific \"definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,\"<ref>p. 3 Archer Taylor. 1931. ''The Proverb''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize its essential characteristics.\n\nMore constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, \"A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation\".<ref>p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. \"The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age 3-40. Oxford University Press.</ref> Norrick created a table of [[distinctive feature]]s to distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc.<ref>p. 73. Neil Norrick. 1985. ''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. Amsterdam: Mouton.</ref> Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, \"True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, [[Wellerism]]s, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons.\"<ref>p. 33. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.</ref> Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: \"A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change.\"<ref>p. 107, Hassan Zolfaghari & Hayat Ameri. \"Persian Proverbs: Definitions and Characteristics\". ''Journal of Islamic and Human Advanced Research'' 2(2012) 93-108.</ref>\n\nThere are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as \"proverbs\", such as weather sayings.

Syntactic Structures in Irish-Language Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 29, 95-136.</ref> In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):\n* Imperative, negative - [[Flogging a dead horse|Don't beat a dead horse.]]\n* Imperative, positive - [[wikt:if the shoe fits, wear it|If the shoe fits, wear it]]!\n* Parallel phrases - Garbage in, garbage out.\n* Rhetorical question - Is the Pope Catholic?\n* Declarative sentence - Birds of a feather flock together.\n\nHowever, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. \"All is fair\" instead of \"All is fair in love and war\", and \"A rolling stone\" for \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\"\n\nThe grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language, often elements are moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.<ref>Sebastian J. Floor. 2005. Poetic Fronting in a Wisdom Poetry Text: The Information Structure of Proverbs 7. ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' 31: 23-58.</ref>\n\nAnother type of grammatical construction is the [[wellerism]], a speaker and a quotation, often with an unusual circumstance, such as the following, a representative of a wellerism proverb found in many languages: \"The bride couldn't dance; she said, 'The room floor isn't flat.'\"<ref>p. 20, 21.

It is also an old proverb in English, but now \"[[last]]\" is no longer known to many.]]\n\n===Conservative language===\n[[File:Latijnse tekst boven portaal.JPG|left|thumb|Latin proverb overdoorway in Netherlands: \"No one attacks me with impunity\"]]\nBecause many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even [[Archaism|archaic]], form. In English, for example, \"betwixt\" is not used by many, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb \"There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\" The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been documented in Amharic,<ref>p. 691.

A&C Black, 2004.</ref>\n\nIn addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. \"C'est la vie\" from French and \"[[Carpe diem]]\" from Latin.\n\nProverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, \"many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters.\"<ref>p. 33. Wolfgang Mieder. 2014. ''Behold the Proverbs of a People: Proverbial Wisdom in Culture, Literature, and Politics.''

Thomas Fielding. 1825. Select proverbs of all nations. New York: Covert.</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0445.jpeg|290px|thumb|''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]\nProverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time. For example, a proverb of the approximate form \"No flies enter a mouth that is shut\" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between. It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors. However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb (Pritchard 1958:146). Another example of a widely spread proverb is \"A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam\", found in Peshai of Afghanistan<ref>p. 67. Ju-Hong Yun and Pashai Language Committee. 2010. On a mountain there is still a road. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.</ref> and Orma of Kenya,<ref>p. 24. Calvin C. Katabarwa and Angelique Chelo. 2012.

Phraseology in planned languages. ''Language problems and language planning'' 23.2: 175-187.</ref>\n\nIt is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb \"Of mothers and water, there is none evil.\" It is found in [[Amharic]], [[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaaba language]], and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], three languages of Ethiopia:\n* Oromo: ''Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.''\n* Amharic: ''K\u00e4\u0259nnat\u0259nna w\u0259ha, k\u0259fu y\u00e4ll\u00e4m.''\n* Alaaba: ''Wiihaa \u0294amaataa hiilu yooseba\u0294a''<ref>p. 92. Gertrud Schneider-Blum. 2009. ''M\u00e1akuti t'aw\u00e1 shuult\u00e1a: Proverbs finish the problems: Sayings of the Alaaba (Ethiopia)''. K\u00f6ln: R\u00fcdiger K\u00f6ppe Verlag.</ref>\nThe Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial ''ha'' in both clauses with the final ''-aa'' in the same word, and both clauses ending with ''-an''. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel ''a'' in the first and last words, but the vowel ''i'' in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.\n\nHowever, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori.<ref>Brougham, Aileen E., Alexander Wyclif Reed, and T\u012bmoti Sam K\u0101retu. ''The Reed book of Maori proverbs.'' Reed Books, 1999.</ref> Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. \"there are no proverbs in [[Kilivila]]\" of the [[Trobriand Islands]].<ref>p. 277. Senft, Gunter. 2010. ''The Trobriand Islanders' Ways of Speaking.'' (Volume 27 of Trends in Linguistics. Documentation.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.</ref>  However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: \"While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all.\"<ref>p. 108. Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group.''</ref> Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not.<ref>Hakamies, Pekka. 2016. \"Proverbs - A Universal Genre?\", in ''Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Folklore and Beyond'', ed. by Kaarina Koski and Frog with Ulla Savolainen, p. 299-316. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society.</ref>\n\n==Use==\n===In conversation===\nProverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen.<ref>Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse''.

Taylor, Archer. 1950. Proverbs. ''Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend'', Maria Leach ed. 902-905. New York: Funk & Wagnalls.</ref>\n\nThe patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of \"classical Chinese novels\" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in ''Water Margin'' (''Sui-hu chuan'') and one proverb every 4,000 words in ''Wen Jou-hsiang''. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.<ref>Eberhard, W. 1967. Some notes on the use of proverbs in Chinese novels. ''Proverbium'' no. 9: 201-208.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hercules & Waggoner2.jpg|left|thumb|\"Hercules and the Wagoner\", illustration for children's book]]\nProverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: ''The Bigger they Come'' by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], and ''Birds of a Feather'' (several books with this title), ''Devil in the Details'' (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as ''The Gift Horse's Mouth'' by Robert Campbell. Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as ''No use dying over spilled milk'',<ref>Myers, Tamar. 1996. ''No use dying over spelled milk''. New York: Penguin Books.</ref> ''When life gives you lululemons,''<ref>Weisburger, Lauren. 2018. ''When life gives you lululemons.'' Simon & Schuster.</ref> and two books titled ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''.<ref>Lynch, Sarah-Kate. 2004. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''. Grand Central Publications and Tricia Goyr & Cara Putman. 2016. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers.''</ref> The twisted proverb of last title was also used in the [[Monty Python]] movie [[Life of Brian]], where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's [[beatitudes]], \"I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'\"\n\nSome books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having \"governing proverbs\" where \"the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying.\"<ref>p. 332. Stanton, Michael. 1996. \"Advice is a dangerous gift\": (Pseudo)proverbs in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Proverbium'' 13:331-346.</ref> Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as \"A stitch in time saves nine\" at the beginning of \"Kitty's Class Day\", one of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Proverb Stories''. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in [[Aesop's Fables]], such as \"[[God helps those who help themselves|Heaven helps those who help themselves]]\" from ''Hercules and the Wagoner''.<ref>p. 19. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.</ref> In a novel by the Ivorian novelist [[Ahmadou Kourouma]], \"proverbs are used to conclude each chapter\".<ref>p. 86. Repinecz, Jonathon. 2013. ''Whose Hero? Reinventing Epic in French West African Literature''. University of California, Berkeley: PhD dissertation.</ref>\n\nProverbs have also been used strategically by poets.<ref>Sobieski, Janet and Wolfgang Mieder. 2005. ''\"So many heads, so many wits\": An anthology of English proverb poetry.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 18.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.</ref> Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or [[anti-proverb]]s) are used for titles, such as \"A bird in the bush\" by [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Lord Kennet]] and his stepson [[Peter Scott]] and \"[[The blind leading the blind]]\" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as [[Paul Muldoon]]'s \"Symposium\", which begins \"You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time...\" In Finnish there are proverb poems written hundreds of years ago.<ref>Lauhakangas, Outi. \"The Oldest Finnish Proverb Poems in Relation to the [[Matti Kuusi]] International Database od Proverbs.\" ''Acta Ethnographica Hungarica'' 45.3-4 (2000): 401-420.</ref> The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as \"Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune.\"<ref>A. L. Macfie and F. A. Macfie. 2001. A Proverb Poem by Refiki. ''Asian Folklore Studies'' Vol. 60, Issue 1, pp. 5-19.</ref> [[Eliza Griswold]] also created a poem by stringing proverbs together, Libyan proverbs translated into English.<ref>Griswold, Eliza. 2012, Libyan Proverbs. ''Poetry'' 201.3:372-377.</ref>\n\nBecause proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,\n<br />\"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo\n<br />They forget that wisdom is greater than power\"<ref>p. 43. Akande, Akinmade Timothy and Adebayo\nMosobalaje. 2014. The use of proverbs in hip-hop music: The example of Yoruba proverbs in 9ices's music. ''Proverbium'' 31:35-58.</ref>\n\nSome authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into \"It's no good crying over spilt potion\" and [[Dumbledore]] advises Harry not to \"count your owls before they are delivered\".<ref>Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards\u2014and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.</ref> In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as \"Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched\" and \"There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.\"<ref>Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. \"The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush\": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs.

''The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone.'' Philadelphia: John Winston.</ref>\n\nBecause proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel ''Ramage and the Rebels'', by [[Dudley Pope]] is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary \"You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream\" (p.&nbsp;259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.<ref>p. 49, Jennifer Speake. 2008. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs'', 5th ed. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nSome authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as [[Charles Dickens]],<ref>George Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1997. ''The Proverbial Charles Dickens''. New York: Peter Lang</ref> [[Agatha Christie]],<ref>George B. Bryan. 1993. ''Black Sheep, Red Herrings, and Blue Murder: The Proverbial Agatha Christie''.

Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self'' by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: \"All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence\"<ref>Connable, Ben.

Ahmed and Reginald H. Green. 1999. The heritage of war and state collapse in Somalia and Somaliland. ''Third World Quarterly'' 20.1:113-127.</ref> An article about research among the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] used a M\u0101ori proverb as a title, then began the article with the M\u0101ori form of the proverb as an epigram \"Set the overgrown bush alight and the new flax shoots will spring up\", followed by three paragraphs about how the proverb served as a metaphor for the research and the present context.<ref>Pia Pohatu and Tui Aroha Warmenhoven. 2007. Set the overgrowth alight and the new shoots will spring forth: New directions in community based research.

Silly Girls. ''Sight and Sound'' 56.1:45-48.</ref>\n\nMovie titles based on proverbs include ''[[Murder Will Out (1939 film)]]'', ''Try, Try Again'', and ''[[The Harder They Fall]]''. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a [[Three Stooges]] film, ''[[A Bird in the Head]]''. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, [[Three Monkeys]], also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.\n\nThey have also been used as the titles of plays:<ref>Bryan, George. 2002. Proverbial titles of dramas.

The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: ''Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou ferm\u00e9e'' (A door must be open or closed) by [[Paul de Musset]]. Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as ''The Full Monty'', which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways.<ref>Konstantinova, Anna. 2012. Proverbs in an American musical: A cognitive-discursive study of \"The Full Monty\".

There have been at least two groups that called themselves \"The Proverbs\", and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as \"Proverb\". In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as ''Spilt milk'' (a title used by [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]] and also [[Kristina Train]]), ''The more things change'' by [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], ''Silk purse'' by [[Linda Ronstadt]], ''Another day, another dollar'' by DJ Scream Roccett, ''[[The blind leading the naked]]'' by [[Violent Femmes]], ''What's good for the goose is good for the gander'' by [[Bobby Rush (musician)|Bobby Rush]], ''Resistance is Futile'' by [[Steve Coleman]], ''Murder will out'' by [[Fan the Fury]].

This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been ''written'' to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals,<ref>Victor Khachan. 2012. Courtroom proverbial murals in Lebanon: a semiotic reconstruction of justice. ''Social Semiotics'' DOI:10.1080/10350330.2012.665262</ref><ref>Martin Charlot. 2007.

''Creativity and Tradition in Cultural Communication'' 1, 269-284.</ref>\n\nSecondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. [[Jakob Jordaens]] painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled ''The King Drinks''. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' by the father and son [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of [[The Blind Leading the Blind]], a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as ''[[Proverbidioms]]'' by [[T. E. Breitenbach]]. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/|title=Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture|date=25 February 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations.<ref>Corey Barksdale. 2011.

When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the [[\u014cmiya Bonsai Village|Bonsai museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]] that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb \"Flowers on a dead tree\" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.<ref>p. 426.

For example, [[Vivienne LeWitt]] painted a piece titled  \"If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?\", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.<ref>{{cite web|author=database and e-research tool for art and design researchers |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/work/if-the-shoe-doesnt-fit-must-we-change-the-foot/ |title=If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? |work=Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date=2012-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown [[Valletta]].<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180203/community/valletta-statue-depicting-proverb-gets-tongues-wagging-online.669628 Article on Maltese proverb sculptures]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-02/local-news/A-bum-a-bird-and-a-pig-Valletta-2018-unveils-Kif-Jghid-Il-Malti-public-art-installations-6736184371|title=A bum, a bird and a pig: Valletta 2018 unveils 'Kif Jg\u0127id Il-Malti' public art installations - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20180202/arts-entertainment/valletta-2018-unveils-public-art-installations.669557|title=Arts & Entertainment|website=Timesofmalta.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===In cartoons===\nCartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb.<ref>Trokhimenko, Olga V. 1999.\"Wie ein Elefant im Porzellanlanden\": Ursprung, \u00dcberlieferung und Gebrauch der Redensart in Deutschen und im Englischen.

Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season.'' New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> The comic strip [[The Argyle Sweater]] showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption \"A fool and his mummy are soon parted.\"<ref>Aug 26, 2012.</ref> The comic [[One Big Happy (comic strip)|One Big Happy]] showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as \"Don't change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers.\"<ref>July 8, 2012</ref>\n\n[[Editorial cartoon]]s can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors.<ref>Weintraut, Edward James. 1999. \"Michel und Mauer\": Post-Unification Germany as seen through Editorial Cartoons. Die Unterrichtspraxis 32.2: 143-150.</ref> In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency ([[General Services Administration|GSA]]) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a [[The pot calling the kettle black|black pot]] labeled \"Congress\" telling a black kettle labeled \"[[General Services Administration|GSA]]\", \"Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!\"<ref>Dana Summers, Orlando Sentinel, Aug 20, 2012.</ref> It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.\n\nCartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them [[editorial cartoons]]. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption \"[[In vino veritas]]\".<ref>p. 389.

This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, \"One picture is worth a thousand words,\" was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).\n\nA few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:\n* \"Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce\" ([[Buffalo Wild Wings]])\n* \"At D & D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks\" (D & D Dogs)\n* \"If at first you don't succeed, you're using the wrong equipment\" ([[John Deere]])\n* \"A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned.\" ([[Volkswagen]])\n* \"Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder.\" ([[Godiva Chocolatier]])\n* \"Where Hogs fly\" ([[Grand Prairie AirHogs]]) baseball team\n* \"Waste not.

''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.</ref> However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples \"both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals\".

These have been labeled \"counter proverbs\"<ref name=\"Charles Clay Doyle 2012\">Charles Clay Doyle. 2012. Counter proverbs. In ''Doing proverbs and other kinds of folklore'', by Charles Clay Doyle, 32-40. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 33.)

Shapiro]]. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.'' New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"counter proverb\" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the [[Tafi language]] of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, \"A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother\" and \"Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother...\"<ref>p. 425, 421.

''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.</ref> such as \"One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death\" countered by \"If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin\". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of \"counter proverbs\".<ref name=\"Singh, Anup K 2017\"/>\n\nDiscussing counter proverbs in the [[Badaga language]], Hockings explained that in his large collection \"a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb ''x'' is used in one context, while ''y'' is used in quite another.\"<ref>Paul Hockings. 1988.

Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: ''An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs'',<ref>Albert Kanlisi Awedoba. 2000.

Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint.<ref>Walter Grauberg. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.</ref> Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values.<ref name=\"Richard Jente 1932\">Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.</ref> Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed \"proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time\",<ref>Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be \"counter proverbs\", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface<ref name=\"Charles Clay Doyle 2012\"/> (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel \"one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs\".<ref>p. 261. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>\n\nMany outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities.<ref>Niemeyer, Larry L., \"Proverbs : tools for world view studies : an exploratory comparison of the Bemba of Zambia and the Shona of Zimbabwe\" (1982). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 886. http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/886</ref> These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.<ref name=\"Richard Jente 1932\"/><ref>Grauberg, Walter. 1989.

Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.</ref>\n\nSeeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the [[Builsa]] society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent.<ref>p. 134. W. Jay Moon. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture: A Narrative Portrayal of Builsa Proverbs''. Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications.</ref> This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus \"Consistently illustrate Tajik values\" and \"The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values\" discerned in the thesis.<ref>p. 139 & 157. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref>\n\nA study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex.<ref>p. 120. Peter Unseth. Review of ''Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. ''American Speech'' 90.1:117-121.</ref> Since the 1960s was also the decade of the [[Sexual revolution]], this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.<ref>Petrova, Roumyana. 2016. How Religious Are The Modern Anglo-American Proverbs: A Linguocultural Study. ''Proceedings of the world congress of the IASS/AIS'', Editor in Chief: Kristian Bankov. ISSN 2414-6862. [http://www.iass-ais.org/proceedings2014/view_lesson.php?id=81 Web access]</ref>\n\nThere are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature \"is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater\".<ref>p. 22, [[Patrick Olivelle]]. 2013. Talking Animals: Explorations in an Indian Literary Genre. ''Religions of South Asia'' 7.14-26.</ref> Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the [[Fula people|Fulani]] cultural value of ''pulaaku''.<ref>Rudolf Leger and Abubakar B. Mohammad. 2000. The concept of pulaaku mirrored in Fulfulde proverbs of the Gombe dialect. ''Berichte des Sonderforschungsbereichs 268, Band 14, Frankfurt a.M. 2000: 299-306.</ref> But using proverbs to ''illustrate'' a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to ''discern'' cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.<ref>Sbaihat, Ahlam (2012). La imagen de la madre en el refranero espa\u00f1ol y jordano. Estudio de Paremiolog\u00eda comparada. Espa\u00f1a: Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide, 5.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: \"The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them.\"<ref>p. 173.Sheila K. Webster. 1982. Women, Sex, and Marriage in Moroccan Proverbs. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 14:173-184.</ref> There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.\n\nIt is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms.<ref>p. 84ff. Andrey Reznikov. 2009. ''Old wine in new bottles: Modern Russian anti-proverbs.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 27.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont</ref> These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. \"Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms\" and \"A good harvest is had only by a collective farm.\" They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced \"newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought\" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.<ref>Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref>\n[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|left|Scroll of the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]]]\n\n===Religion===\nMany proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from [[Dari Persian|Dari]] of Afghanistan:<ref>p. 54, J. Christy Wilson, Jr. 2004. ''One hundred Afghan Persian proverbs'' 3rd, edition. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.</ref> \"In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?\"\n\nClearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the [[Badagas]] of India ([[Shaivism|Sahivite]] Hindus), there is a traditional proverb \"Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself].\"<ref>p. 601, Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the Ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens and curses''. Berlin: de Gruyter.</ref>  Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo.<ref name=\"Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009\"/> The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is ''The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world'' by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book.<ref>Ziyad Mohammad Gogazeh and Ahmad Husein Al-Afif. 2007. Los proverbios \u00e1rabes extraidos del ''Cor\u00e1n'': recopilaci\u00f3n, traducci\u00f3n, y estudio. ''Paremia'' 16: 129-138.</ref> For example, many quote \"Be sure your sin will find you out\" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 32:23).\n\nNot all religious references in proverbs are positive, some are cynical, such as the Tajik, \"Do as the mullah says, not as he does.\"<ref>p. 130, Evan Bell. 2009. ''The wit and wisdom of the Tajiks: An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics, MA thesis.</ref> Also, note the Italian proverb, \"One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints\". An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism, \"[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama\".<ref>p. 16, P. R. Gurdon. 1895. ''Some Assamese proverbs.'' Shillong, India: Assam Secretariat Printing Office.</ref> In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. \"If the lama's own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas.\"<ref>p. 142. August Francke. 1901. A collection of Ladakhi proverbs. ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 2: 135-148.</ref> Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the [[Lur people|Lur]], a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.<ref>Peter Unseth (2017). Review of ''Warm Hearts and Sharp Tongues: Life in 555 Proverbs from the Zagros Mountains of Iran''.

Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.<ref>Sharab, Moayad; Sbaihat, Ahlam; Al Duweiri, Hussein (2013).

For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with \"Birds of a feather flock together\", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know \"Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle\", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed \"every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches\".<ref>p. 91 Grigorii L'vovich Permiakov. 1989.

A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder's 2004 volume, ''Proverbs: A Handbook''. Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998).<ref>Mbiti, John. 2002. The African proverbs project and after. ''Lexikos'', 12(1): 256-263.</ref> Paczolay has compared proverbs across Europe and published a collection of similar proverbs in 55 languages (1997). Mieder edits an academic journal of proverb study, ''[[Proverbium (journal)|Proverbium]]'' ({{ISSN|0743-782X}}), many back issues of which are available online.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006930797|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715020433/http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006930797|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2013|title=Proverbium.|last1=Universi\u1e6dah ha-\u02bbIvrit bi-Yerushalayim.|last2=University of Vermont.|last3=Ohio State University.|date=29 November 1984|pages=v|via=Hathi Trust}}</ref>  A volume containing articles on a wide variety of topics touching on proverbs was edited by Mieder and [[Alan Dundes]] (1994/1981).

Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Latin scholar (1466 \u2013 1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as ''[[Adagia]]'', spread Latin proverbs across Europe.<ref>Erasmus, Desiderius.

Hern\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez published a collection of Spanish proverbs (1555).\n\nIn the 19th century, a growing number of scholars published collections of proverbs, such as [[Samuel Adalberg]] who published collections of Yiddish proverbs (1888 & 1890) and Polish proverbs (1889\u20131894). [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], the [[Anglican]] bishop in Nigeria, published a collection of [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] proverbs (1852). [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]] published a collection of Finnish proverbs (1842).\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. [[Alan Dundes]] was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a \"pioneering paremiologist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol35/mieder.pdf|title=Alan Dundes as Pioneering Paremiologist.|publisher=}}</ref> [[Matti Kuusi]] was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs.<ref>Lauhakangas, Outi. 2013.

Proverbs are often [[metaphor]]ical and use [[formulaic speech|formulaic language]]. Collectively, they form a [[folklore genre|genre of folklore]].\n\nSome proverbs exist in more than u one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures similar to theirs. In the West, the [[Bible]] (including, but not limited to the [[Book of Proverbs]]) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of [[Erasmus]]) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the \"major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,\"<ref>p. 12, Wolfgang Mieder. 1990. ''Not by bread alone: Proverbs of the Bible''. New England Press.</ref> whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, eleven are from the Bible.<ref>Paczolay, Gyula. 1997. ''European Proverbs in 55 Languages''. Veszpre'm, Hungary.</ref> However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.\n\n== Definitions ==\n[[Lord John Russell]] (c. 1850) observed poetically that a \"proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many.\"<ref>p. 25. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. \"The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age'' 3-40. Oxford University Press.</ref> But giving the word \"proverb\" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote [[Archer Taylor]]'s argument that formulating a scientific \"definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,\"<ref>p. 3 Archer Taylor. 1931. ''The Proverb''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref> many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize its essential characteristics.\n\nMore constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, \"A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation\".<ref>p. 5. Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. \"The wit of one, and the wisdom of many: General thoughts on the nature of the proverb. Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age 3-40.

''How Proverbs Mean: Semantic Studies in English Proverbs''. Amsterdam: Mouton.</ref> Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, \"True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, [[Wellerism]]s, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons.\"<ref>p. 33. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African-American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.</ref> Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: \"A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change.\"<ref>p. 107, Hassan Zolfaghari & Hayat Ameri. \"Persian Proverbs: Definitions and Characteristics\". ''Journal of Islamic and Human Advanced Research'' 2(2012) 93-108.</ref>\n\nThere are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as \"proverbs\", such as weather sayings. [[Alan Dundes]], however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: \"Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'\"<ref>p. 45. Alan Dundes. 1984. On whether weather 'proverbs' are proverbs. ''Proverbium'' 1:39-46. Also, 1989, in ''Folklore Matters'' edited by Alan Dundes, 92-97. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press.</ref> The definition of \"proverb\" has also changed over the years. For example, the following was labeled \"A Yorkshire proverb\" in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, \"as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth\".<ref>A Yorkshire proverb. 1883. ''The Academy''. July 14, no. 584. p.30.</ref> The changing of the definition of \"proverb\" is also noted in Turkish.<ref>Ezgi Ulusoy Aranyosi. 2010. \"Atas\u00f6z\u00fc neydi, ne oldu?\" [\"What was, and what now is, a 'proverb'?\"]. ''Mill\u00ee Folklor: International and Quarterly Journal of Cultural Studies'' 11.88: 5-15.</ref>\n\nIn other languages and cultures, the definition of \"proverb\" also differs from English. In the [[Chumburung language]] of Ghana, \"''a\u014base'' are literal proverbs and ''akpare'' are metaphoric ones\".<ref>p. 64. Gillian Hansford. 2003. Understanding Chumburung proverbs. ''Journal of West African Languages'' 30.1:57-82.</ref> Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate \"proverb\": ''ere, ivbe'', and ''itan''. The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was \"linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse\".<ref>p. 4,5. Daniel Ben-Amos. Introduction: Folklore in African Society. ''Forms of Folklore in Africa'', edited by Bernth Lindfors, pp. 1-36. Austin: University of Texas.</ref> Among the [[Balochi language|Balochi]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word ''batal'' for ordinary proverbs and ''bass\u012bttuks'' for \"proverbs with background stories\".<ref>p. 43. Sabir Badalkhan. 2000. \"Ropes break at the weakest point\": Some examples of Balochi proverbs with background stories.

Syntactic Structures in Irish-Language Proverbs. ''Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship'' 29, 95-136.</ref> In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):\n* Imperative, negative - [[Flogging a dead horse|Don't beat a dead horse.]]\n* Imperative, positive - [[wikt:if the shoe fits, wear it|If the shoe fits, wear it]]!\n* Parallel phrases - Garbage in, garbage out.\n* Rhetorical question - Is the Pope Catholic?\n* Declarative sentence - Birds of a feather flock together.\n\nHowever, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. \"All is fair\" instead of \"All is fair in love and war\", and \"A rolling stone\" for \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\"\n\nThe grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language, often elements are moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.<ref>Sebastian J. Floor. 2005. Poetic Fronting in a Wisdom Poetry Text: The Information Structure of Proverbs 7. ''Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages'' 31: 23-58.</ref>\n\nAnother type of grammatical construction is the [[wellerism]], a speaker and a quotation, often with an unusual circumstance, such as the following, a representative of a wellerism proverb found in many languages: \"The bride couldn't dance; she said, 'The room floor isn't flat.'\"<ref>p. 20, 21.

It is also an old proverb in English, but now \"[[last]]\" is no longer known to many.]]\n\n===Conservative language===\n[[File:Latijnse tekst boven portaal.JPG|left|thumb|Latin proverb overdoorway in Netherlands: \"No one attacks me with impunity\"]]\nBecause many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even [[Archaism|archaic]], form. In English, for example, \"betwixt\" is not used by many, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb \"There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\" The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been documented in Amharic,<ref>p. 691.

A&C Black, 2004.</ref>\n\nIn addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. \"C'est la vie\" from French and \"[[Carpe diem]]\" from Latin.\n\nProverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, \"many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters.\"<ref>p. 33. Wolfgang Mieder. 2014. ''Behold the Proverbs of a People: Proverbial Wisdom in Culture, Literature, and Politics.''

DOI: 10.1080/02666286.2016.1167577.</ref>\n\n===Borrowing and spread===\nProverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. \"There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity.\"<ref>p. ii. Thomas Fielding. 1825. Select proverbs of all nations. New York: Covert.</ref>\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0447\u0430 \u043e \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0445.jpeg|290px|thumb|''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]\nProverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time. For example, a proverb of the approximate form \"No flies enter a mouth that is shut\" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between. It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors. However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb (Pritchard 1958:146). Another example of a widely spread proverb is \"A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam\", found in Peshai of Afghanistan<ref>p. 67. Ju-Hong Yun and Pashai Language Committee. 2010. On a mountain there is still a road. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.</ref> and Orma of Kenya,<ref>p. 24. Calvin C. Katabarwa and Angelique Chelo. 2012. Wisdom from Orma, Kenya proverbs and wise sayings.

Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia (1985)</ref> An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for [[Esperanto]], where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.<ref>Fiedler, Sabine. 1999. Phraseology in planned languages. ''Language problems and language planning'' 23.2: 175-187.</ref>\n\nIt is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb \"Of mothers and water, there is none evil.\" It is found in [[Amharic]], [[Alaba-K'abeena language|Alaaba language]], and [[Oromo language|Oromo]], three languages of Ethiopia:\n* Oromo: ''Hadhaa fi bishaan, hamaa hin qaban.''\n* Amharic: ''K\u00e4\u0259nnat\u0259nna w\u0259ha, k\u0259fu y\u00e4ll\u00e4m.''\n* Alaaba: ''Wiihaa \u0294amaataa hiilu yooseba\u0294a''<ref>p. 92. Gertrud Schneider-Blum. 2009. ''M\u00e1akuti t'aw\u00e1 shuult\u00e1a: Proverbs finish the problems: Sayings of the Alaaba (Ethiopia)''. K\u00f6ln: R\u00fcdiger K\u00f6ppe Verlag.</ref>\nThe Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial ''ha'' in both clauses with the final ''-aa'' in the same word, and both clauses ending with ''-an''. Also, both clauses are built with the vowel ''a'' in the first and last words, but the vowel ''i'' in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.\n\nHowever, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori.<ref>Brougham, Aileen E., Alexander Wyclif Reed, and T\u012bmoti Sam K\u0101retu. ''The Reed book of Maori proverbs.'' Reed Books, 1999.</ref> Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. \"there are no proverbs in [[Kilivila]]\" of the [[Trobriand Islands]].<ref>p. 277. Senft, Gunter. 2010. ''The Trobriand Islanders' Ways of Speaking.'' (Volume 27 of Trends in Linguistics. Documentation.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.</ref>  However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: \"While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all.\"<ref>p. 108. Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A handbook. Greenwood Publishing Group.''</ref> Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not.<ref>Hakamies, Pekka. 2016. \"Proverbs - A Universal Genre?\", in ''Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Folklore and Beyond'', ed. by Kaarina Koski and Frog with Ulla Savolainen, p. 299-316. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society.</ref>\n\n==Use==\n===In conversation===\nProverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen.<ref>Elias Dominguez Baraja. 2010. ''The function of proverbs in discourse''. Berlin: de Gruyter Mouton.</ref> An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.<ref name=\"Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009\">Tadesse Jaleta Jirata. 2009.

Taylor, Archer. 1950. Proverbs. ''Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend'', Maria Leach ed. 902-905. New York: Funk & Wagnalls.</ref>\n\nThe patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of \"classical Chinese novels\" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in ''Water Margin'' (''Sui-hu chuan'') and one proverb every 4,000 words in ''Wen Jou-hsiang''. But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.<ref>Eberhard, W. 1967. Some notes on the use of proverbs in Chinese novels. ''Proverbium'' no. 9: 201-208.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hercules & Waggoner2.jpg|left|thumb|\"Hercules and the Wagoner\", illustration for children's book]]\nProverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: ''The Bigger they Come'' by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]], and ''Birds of a Feather'' (several books with this title), ''Devil in the Details'' (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as ''The Gift Horse's Mouth'' by Robert Campbell. Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as ''No use dying over spilled milk'',<ref>Myers, Tamar. 1996. ''No use dying over spelled milk''. New York: Penguin Books.</ref> ''When life gives you lululemons,''<ref>Weisburger, Lauren. 2018. ''When life gives you lululemons.'' Simon & Schuster.</ref> and two books titled ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''.<ref>Lynch, Sarah-Kate. 2004. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers''. Grand Central Publications and Tricia Goyr & Cara Putman. 2016. ''Blessed are the Cheesemakers.''</ref> The twisted proverb of last title was also used in the [[Monty Python]] movie [[Life of Brian]], where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's [[beatitudes]], \"I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'\"\n\nSome books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having \"governing proverbs\" where \"the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying.\"<ref>p. 332. Stanton, Michael. 1996. \"Advice is a dangerous gift\": (Pseudo)proverbs in ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''Proverbium'' 13:331-346.</ref> Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as \"A stitch in time saves nine\" at the beginning of \"Kitty's Class Day\", one of [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''Proverb Stories''. Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in [[Aesop's Fables]], such as \"[[God helps those who help themselves|Heaven helps those who help themselves]]\" from ''Hercules and the Wagoner''.<ref>p. 19. Kent, Graeme. 1991. ''Aesop's Fables.'' Newmarket, UK: Brimax.</ref> In a novel by the Ivorian novelist [[Ahmadou Kourouma]], \"proverbs are used to conclude each chapter\".<ref>p. 86. Repinecz, Jonathon. 2013. ''Whose Hero? Reinventing Epic in French West African Literature''. University of California, Berkeley: PhD dissertation.</ref>\n\nProverbs have also been used strategically by poets.<ref>Sobieski, Janet and Wolfgang Mieder. 2005. ''\"So many heads, so many wits\": An anthology of English proverb poetry.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 18.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.</ref> Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or [[anti-proverb]]s) are used for titles, such as \"A bird in the bush\" by [[Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Lord Kennet]] and his stepson [[Peter Scott]] and \"[[The blind leading the blind]]\" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as [[Paul Muldoon]]'s \"Symposium\", which begins \"You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time...\" In Finnish there are proverb poems written hundreds of years ago.<ref>Lauhakangas, Outi. \"The Oldest Finnish Proverb Poems in Relation to the [[Matti Kuusi]] International Database od Proverbs.\" ''Acta Ethnographica Hungarica'' 45.3-4 (2000): 401-420.</ref> The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as \"Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune.\"<ref>A. L. Macfie and F. A. Macfie. 2001. A Proverb Poem by Refiki. ''Asian Folklore Studies'' Vol. 60, Issue 1, pp. 5-19.</ref> [[Eliza Griswold]] also created a poem by stringing proverbs together, Libyan proverbs translated into English.<ref>Griswold, Eliza. 2012, Libyan Proverbs. ''Poetry'' 201.3:372-377.</ref>\n\nBecause proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,\n<br />\"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo\n<br />They forget that wisdom is greater than power\"<ref>p. 43. Akande, Akinmade Timothy and Adebayo\nMosobalaje. 2014. The use of proverbs in hip-hop music: The example of Yoruba proverbs in 9ices's music. ''Proverbium'' 31:35-58.</ref>\n\nSome authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into \"It's no good crying over spilt potion\" and [[Dumbledore]] advises Harry not to \"count your owls before they are delivered\".<ref>Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards\u2014and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.</ref> In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as \"Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched\" and \"There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.\"<ref>Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. \"The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush\": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs.

''The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone.'' Philadelphia: John Winston.</ref>\n\nBecause proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel ''Ramage and the Rebels'', by [[Dudley Pope]] is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary \"You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream\" (p.&nbsp;259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.<ref>p. 49, Jennifer Speake. 2008. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs'', 5th ed. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nSome authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as [[Charles Dickens]],<ref>George Bryan and Wolfgang Mieder. 1997. ''The Proverbial Charles Dickens''. New York: Peter Lang</ref> [[Agatha Christie]],<ref>George B. Bryan. 1993. ''Black Sheep, Red Herrings, and Blue Murder: The Proverbial Agatha Christie''.

Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self'' by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: \"All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence\"<ref>Connable, Ben.

Silly Girls. ''Sight and Sound'' 56.1:45-48.</ref>\n\nMovie titles based on proverbs include ''[[Murder Will Out (1939 film)]]'', ''Try, Try Again'', and ''[[The Harder They Fall]]''. A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a [[Three Stooges]] film, ''[[A Bird in the Head]]''. The title of an award-winning Turkish film, [[Three Monkeys]], also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.\n\nThey have also been used as the titles of plays:<ref>Bryan, George. 2002.

The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: ''Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou ferm\u00e9e'' (A door must be open or closed) by [[Paul de Musset]]. Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as ''The Full Monty'', which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways.<ref>Konstantinova, Anna. 2012.

This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been ''written'' to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals,<ref>Victor Khachan. 2012.

[[Jakob Jordaens]] painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled ''The King Drinks''. Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' by the father and son [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of [[The Blind Leading the Blind]], a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as ''[[Proverbidioms]]'' by [[T. E. Breitenbach]]. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://writecantonese8.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/cantonese-proverbs-in-one-picture/|title=Cantonese Proverbs in One Picture|date=25 February 2014|publisher=}}</ref>  Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations.<ref>Corey Barksdale. 2011.

When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the [[\u014cmiya Bonsai Village|Bonsai museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama city]] that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb \"Flowers on a dead tree\" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.<ref>p. 426.

For example, [[Vivienne LeWitt]] painted a piece titled  \"If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?\", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.<ref>{{cite web|author=database and e-research tool for art and design researchers |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/work/if-the-shoe-doesnt-fit-must-we-change-the-foot/ |title=If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot? |work=Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date=2012-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown [[Valletta]].<ref>[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20180203/community/valletta-statue-depicting-proverb-gets-tongues-wagging-online.669628 Article on Maltese proverb sculptures]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2018-02-02/local-news/A-bum-a-bird-and-a-pig-Valletta-2018-unveils-Kif-Jghid-Il-Malti-public-art-installations-6736184371|title=A bum, a bird and a pig: Valletta 2018 unveils 'Kif Jg\u0127id Il-Malti' public art installations - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/mobile/articles/view/20180202/arts-entertainment/valletta-2018-unveils-public-art-installations.669557|title=Arts & Entertainment|website=Timesofmalta.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===In cartoons===\nCartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb.<ref>Trokhimenko, Olga V. 1999.\"Wie ein Elefant im Porzellanlanden\": Ursprung, \u00dcberlieferung und Gebrauch der Redensart in Deutschen und im Englischen.

Die Unterrichtspraxis 32.2: 143-150.</ref> In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency ([[General Services Administration|GSA]]) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a [[The pot calling the kettle black|black pot]] labeled \"Congress\" telling a black kettle labeled \"[[General Services Administration|GSA]]\", \"Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!\"<ref>Dana Summers, Orlando Sentinel, Aug 20, 2012.</ref> It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.\n\nCartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them [[editorial cartoons]]. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption \"[[In vino veritas]]\".<ref>p. 389.

This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, \"One picture is worth a thousand words,\" was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).\n\nA few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:\n* \"Live by the sauce, dine by the sauce\" ([[Buffalo Wild Wings]])\n* \"At D & D Dogs, you can teach an old dog new tricks\" (D & D Dogs)\n* \"If at first you don't succeed, you're using the wrong equipment\" ([[John Deere]])\n* \"A pfennig saved is a pfennig earned.\" ([[Volkswagen]])\n* \"Not only absence makes the heart grow fonder.\" ([[Godiva Chocolatier]])\n* \"Where Hogs fly\" ([[Grand Prairie AirHogs]]) baseball team\n* \"Waste not.

''Journal of Folklore Research'' 38.3: 229-241.</ref> However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples \"both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals\".

These have been labeled \"counter proverbs\"<ref name=\"Charles Clay Doyle 2012\">Charles Clay Doyle. 2012. Counter proverbs. In ''Doing proverbs and other kinds of folklore'', by Charles Clay Doyle, 32-40. (Supplement series of ''Proverbium'' 33.)

Shapiro]]. 2012. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs.'' New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"counter proverb\" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the [[Tafi language]] of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, \"A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother\" and \"Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother...\"<ref>p. 425, 421.

But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory,<ref>p. 157-171, Helen Atawube Yitah. 2006. ''Saying Their Own 'truth': Kasena Women's (de)construction of Gender Through Proverbial Jesting.'' Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California.</ref> such as \"One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death\" countered by \"If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin\". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of \"counter proverbs\".<ref name=\"Singh, Anup K 2017\"/>\n\nDiscussing counter proverbs in the [[Badaga language]], Hockings explained that in his large collection \"a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb ''x'' is used in one context, while ''y'' is used in quite another.\"<ref>Paul Hockings. 1988.

Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: ''An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs'',<ref>Albert Kanlisi Awedoba. 2000.

Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint.<ref>Walter Grauberg. 1989. Proverbs and idioms: mirrors of national experience? ''Lexicographers and their works'', ed. by Gregory James, 94-99. Exeter: University of Exeter.</ref> Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values.<ref name=\"Richard Jente 1932\">Richard Jente. 1931-1932. The American Proverb. ''American Speech'' 7:342-348.</ref> Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed \"proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time\",<ref>Wolfgang Mieder. 1993. ''Proverbs are never out of season: Popular wisdom in the modern age''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be \"counter proverbs\", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface<ref name=\"Charles Clay Doyle 2012\"/> (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel \"one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs\".<ref>p. 261. Sw. Anand Prahlad. 1996. ''African American Proverbs in Context''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi.</ref>\n\nMany outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities.<ref>Niemeyer, Larry L., \"Proverbs : tools for world view studies : an exploratory comparison of the Bemba of Zambia and the Shona of Zimbabwe\" (1982). Dissertations and Theses. Paper 886. http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/886</ref> These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted.<ref name=\"Richard Jente 1932\"/><ref>Grauberg, Walter. 1989.

Burlington, VT: University of Vermont.</ref>\n\nSeeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the [[Builsa]] society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent.<ref>p. 134. W. Jay Moon. 2009. ''African Proverbs Reveal Christianity in Culture: A Narrative Portrayal of Builsa Proverbs''. Eugene, OR: Pickwick Publications.</ref> This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus \"Consistently illustrate Tajik values\" and \"The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values\" discerned in the thesis.<ref>p. 139 & 157. Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref>\n\nA study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex.<ref>p. 120. Peter Unseth. Review of ''Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. ''American Speech'' 90.1:117-121.</ref> Since the 1960s was also the decade of the [[Sexual revolution]], this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.<ref>Petrova, Roumyana. 2016. How Religious Are The Modern Anglo-American Proverbs: A Linguocultural Study. ''Proceedings of the world congress of the IASS/AIS'', Editor in Chief: Kristian Bankov. ISSN 2414-6862. [http://www.iass-ais.org/proceedings2014/view_lesson.php?id=81 Web access]</ref>\n\nThere are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature \"is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater\".<ref>p. 22, [[Patrick Olivelle]]. 2013. Talking Animals: Explorations in an Indian Literary Genre. ''Religions of South Asia'' 7.14-26.</ref> Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the [[Fula people|Fulani]] cultural value of ''pulaaku''.<ref>Rudolf Leger and Abubakar B. Mohammad. 2000. The concept of pulaaku mirrored in Fulfulde proverbs of the Gombe dialect. ''Berichte des Sonderforschungsbereichs 268, Band 14, Frankfurt a.M. 2000: 299-306.</ref> But using proverbs to ''illustrate'' a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to ''discern'' cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.<ref>Sbaihat, Ahlam (2012). La imagen de la madre en el refranero espa\u00f1ol y jordano. Estudio de Paremiolog\u00eda comparada. Espa\u00f1a: Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Estudios Literarios de Cultura Popular, Oceanide, 5.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: \"The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them.\"<ref>p. 173.Sheila K. Webster. 1982. Women, Sex, and Marriage in Moroccan Proverbs. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' 14:173-184.</ref> There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.\n\nIt is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms.<ref>p. 84ff. Andrey Reznikov. 2009. ''Old wine in new bottles: Modern Russian anti-proverbs.'' (Supplement Series of ''Proverbium'', 27.) Burlington, VT: University of Vermont</ref> These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. \"Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms\" and \"A good harvest is had only by a collective farm.\" They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced \"newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought\" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.<ref>Evan Bell. 2009. ''An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Masters thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics.</ref>\n[[File:Proverb scroll.PNG|thumb|left|Scroll of the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]]]\n\n===Religion===\nMany proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the [[Book of Proverbs]] in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from [[Dari Persian|Dari]] of Afghanistan:<ref>p. 54, J. Christy Wilson, Jr. 2004. ''One hundred Afghan Persian proverbs'' 3rd, edition. Peshawar, Pakistan: InterLit Foundation.</ref> \"In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?\"\n\nClearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the [[Badagas]] of India ([[Shaivism|Sahivite]] Hindus), there is a traditional proverb \"Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself].\"<ref>p. 601, Paul Hockings. 1988. ''Counsel from the Ancients: A study of Badaga proverbs, prayers, omens and curses''. Berlin: de Gruyter.</ref>  Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo.<ref name=\"Tadesse Jaleta Jirata 2009\"/> The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is ''The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world'' by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book.<ref>Ziyad Mohammad Gogazeh and Ahmad Husein Al-Afif. 2007. Los proverbios \u00e1rabes extraidos del ''Cor\u00e1n'': recopilaci\u00f3n, traducci\u00f3n, y estudio. ''Paremia'' 16: 129-138.</ref> For example, many quote \"Be sure your sin will find you out\" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 32:23).\n\nNot all religious references in proverbs are positive, some are cynical, such as the Tajik, \"Do as the mullah says, not as he does.\"<ref>p. 130, Evan Bell. 2009. ''The wit and wisdom of the Tajiks: An analysis of Tajik proverbs''. Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics, MA thesis.</ref> Also, note the Italian proverb, \"One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints\". An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism, \"[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama\".<ref>p. 16, P. R. Gurdon. 1895. ''Some Assamese proverbs.'' Shillong, India: Assam Secretariat Printing Office.</ref> In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. \"If the lama's own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas.\"<ref>p. 142. August Francke. 1901. A collection of Ladakhi proverbs. ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' 2: 135-148.</ref> Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the [[Lur people|Lur]], a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.<ref>Peter Unseth (2017). Review of ''Warm Hearts and Sharp Tongues: Life in 555 Proverbs from the Zagros Mountains of Iran''.

Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.<ref>Sharab, Moayad; Sbaihat, Ahlam; Al Duweiri, Hussein (2013).

There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly 'proverbial' in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences\n\n===Paremiological minimum===\nGrigorii Permjakov<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.arnes.si/~bridges/proverb_wisdom.htm|title=Photo and Web page about Permjakov|publisher=}}</ref> developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the \"paremiological minimum\" (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with \"Birds of a feather flock together\", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know \"Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle\", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed \"every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches\".<ref>p. 91 Grigorii L'vovich Permiakov. 1989.

Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a Latin scholar (1466 \u2013 1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as ''[[Adagia]]'', spread Latin proverbs across Europe.<ref>Erasmus, Desiderius. Adages in Collected Works of Erasmus. Trans. R.A.B Mynors et al. Volumes 31\u201336. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982\u20132006.</ref> [[Juan de Mal Lara]] was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 ''Philosophia vulgar'', the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings. Hern\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez published a collection of Spanish proverbs (1555).\n\nIn the 19th century, a growing number of scholars published collections of proverbs, such as [[Samuel Adalberg]] who published collections of Yiddish proverbs (1888 & 1890) and Polish proverbs (1889\u20131894). [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], the [[Anglican]] bishop in Nigeria, published a collection of [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] proverbs (1852). [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]] published a collection of Finnish proverbs (1842).\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. [[Alan Dundes]] was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a \"pioneering paremiologist\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol35/mieder.pdf|title=Alan Dundes as Pioneering Paremiologist.|publisher=}}</ref> [[Matti Kuusi]] was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs.<ref>Lauhakangas, Outi. 2013.
