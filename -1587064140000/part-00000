Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.\n\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building.

Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the [[evaporation]]. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|-14|C|0}} while the ambient temperature was {{convert|18|C|0}}. Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C|0}}, a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|-14|C|0}}. Franklin concluded: \"From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Benjamin|title=Letter to John Lining |url= http://www.waughfamily.ca/Montgomery/benfranklin1758.htm |accessdate=6 August 2014|date=17 June 1758}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, English scientist and inventor [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that compressing and liquefying [[ammonia]] could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Electrical air conditioning===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nThe creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor [[Willis Carrier|Willis H.

There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in [[Buffalo, New York]] by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.<ref>http://www.williscarrier.com/m/1876-1902.php</ref>\n\nDesigned to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.<ref>{{citation|title=Apparatus for treating air |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US808897A/en |date=16 September 1904|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by [[Charles Gilbert Gates|Charles Gates]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/ |title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning |publisher=Popular Mechanics |first=Amanda |last=Green |date=January 1, 2015 |accessdate=31 January 2020}}</ref> Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, David St. Pierre DuBose (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home ''Meadowmont'', all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.{{when|date=September 2015}} This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for [[central air conditioning]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rizzoconferencecenter.com/PDFs/History-of-Meadowmont.pdf |title=Early University Benefactors |publisher=Rizzoconferencecenter.com |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Robert Sherman of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://navlog.org/patent_1.html|title=Unsung Engineering Heros: Robert Sherman |publisher=Navlog.org|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Refrigerant development===\n{{Main|Refrigerant}}\n[[File:Embraco compressor.jpg|thumb|A modern [[R-134a]] hermetic refrigeration [[gas compressor|compressor]]]]\nThe first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic or flammable gases, such as [[ammonia]], [[methyl chloride]], or [[propane]], that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'' (R-12), in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional \"shot\" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all \"R-134a\" systems whether \"converted\" or \"factory\", even $50-$100 per pound of R-12 is considered \"cheap\" by many individuals.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane|title=Air Conditioners & Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011}}</ref> HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.

Notice [[frost]] formation.]]\n\nCooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] cycle, which uses the forced circulation and [[phase transition|phase change]] of a [[refrigerant]] between gas and liquid to transfer heat.\n\nThe vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a [[chiller]] that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a [[variable refrigerant flow]] terminal or [[fan coil unit]]) on its evaporator side and [[Waste heat|heat rejection]] equipment on its condenser side.\n\n==== Heat pump ====\nMain article: [[Heat pump]]\n\nSome air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the [[refrigeration cycle]] and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4\u201313 \u00b0C (40\u201355 \u00b0F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\n\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a [[natural gas]], [[Heating oil|oil]] or [[tree]] [[fireplace]] or [[central heating]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\n{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace|edition=2nd |first=Shane |last=Smith |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55591-450-9|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window}}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n===Free cooling===\n{{Main|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-[[glycol]] mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Snijders|first=Aart|date=2008|url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf|title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International|website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Humidity control==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, reducing [[relative humidity]] can promote occupant comfort. An air conditioner designed for an occupied space typically will create a 30% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space to balance comfort, microbial growth, and other [[indoor air quality]] factors.<ref name=\"Dristeem1\">{{cite web|title=Dristeem: Humidity and Comfort|url=http://www.dristeem-media.com/literature/Web_HumidityAndComfort.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dehumidification and cooling===\nAir conditioning equipment will reduce the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system if the surface of the evaporator coil is significantly cooler than the [[dewpoint]] of the surrounding air. Moisture from the air will condense on the coil and must be disposed of or recycled.\n\n===Dehumidification program===\n\nMost modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.\n\nOccasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nInverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Dehumidifier===\n{{main|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n==Energy transfer==\n{{globalize section|date=March 2020}}\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F.|editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}</ref> To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winnick |first= J. |title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=18 May 2007|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|archivedate=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&nbsp;kW) in capacity.\n\n===Seasonal energy efficiency ratio===\n{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|European seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S |title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2 July 2006|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\nIn 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html |website=Sylvane|title=PTAC Buying Guide}}</ref> They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a [[heat pump]]. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Room-size air conditioner fits under window sill |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=63 |issue=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |page=885 |date=June 1935 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Split systems===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\n\n====Mini-split (ductless) system====\n[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Condenser side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\n[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Evaporator, or terminal, side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's. Large systems are known as VRF ([[Variable refrigerant flow]]) systems. Mini split ductless systems were invented by [[Daikin]] in 1973, and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/corporate/overview/summary/history/digest/|title=History of Daikin Innovation |website=daikin.com |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh|title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Cooling & Heating &#124; HVAC|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=17 February 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>{{cite web|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy|date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems.

In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\n\nA large Multi Split System is called a [[Variable refrigerant flow]] system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install.\n\n''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':\n\nOther common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\n\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.\n\n=====Multi-split system installation considerations=====\nBefore selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\n\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\n\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\n\n===Air-only central air conditioning===\nCentral [[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]] A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an [[air handler]] and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air.\n\n===Central plant cooling===\n{{see also|Chiller}}\n[[File:Industrial air conditioning unit (DFdB).JPG|thumb|A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower]]\nCentral cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units.\n\n===Portable units===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n====Portable split system====\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/portable-or-split-system-air-conditioning-the-pros-and-cons/|title=Portable Vs Split System Air Conditioning &#124; Pros & Cons|date=August 14, 2018|website=Canstar Blue}}</ref>\n\n====Portable hose system====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose |publisher=Experts123.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n====Portable evaporative system====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\n\n==Uses==\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.\n\n===Comfort applications===\n[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building]]\nComfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\n\nAir conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]].

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.\n\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building.

In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Electrical air conditioning===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nThe creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor [[Willis Carrier|Willis H.

There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in [[Buffalo, New York]] by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.<ref>http://www.williscarrier.com/m/1876-1902.php</ref>\n\nDesigned to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants.

[[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'' (R-12), in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional \"shot\" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all \"R-134a\" systems whether \"converted\" or \"factory\", even $50-$100 per pound of R-12 is considered \"cheap\" by many individuals.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane|title=Air Conditioners & Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011}}</ref> HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.

Notice [[frost]] formation.]]\n\nCooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] cycle, which uses the forced circulation and [[phase transition|phase change]] of a [[refrigerant]] between gas and liquid to transfer heat.\n\nThe vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a [[chiller]] that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a [[variable refrigerant flow]] terminal or [[fan coil unit]]) on its evaporator side and [[Waste heat|heat rejection]] equipment on its condenser side.\n\n==== Heat pump ====\nMain article: [[Heat pump]]\n\nSome air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the [[refrigeration cycle]] and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4\u201313 \u00b0C (40\u201355 \u00b0F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\n\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a [[natural gas]], [[Heating oil|oil]] or [[tree]] [[fireplace]] or [[central heating]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\n{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace|edition=2nd |first=Shane |last=Smith |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55591-450-9|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window}}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n===Free cooling===\n{{Main|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-[[glycol]] mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Snijders|first=Aart|date=2008|url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf|title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International|website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Humidity control==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, reducing [[relative humidity]] can promote occupant comfort. An air conditioner designed for an occupied space typically will create a 30% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space to balance comfort, microbial growth, and other [[indoor air quality]] factors.<ref name=\"Dristeem1\">{{cite web|title=Dristeem: Humidity and Comfort|url=http://www.dristeem-media.com/literature/Web_HumidityAndComfort.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Dehumidification and cooling===\nAir conditioning equipment will reduce the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system if the surface of the evaporator coil is significantly cooler than the [[dewpoint]] of the surrounding air. Moisture from the air will condense on the coil and must be disposed of or recycled.\n\n===Dehumidification program===\n\nMost modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.\n\nOccasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nInverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Dehumidifier===\n{{main|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n==Energy transfer==\n{{globalize section|date=March 2020}}\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F.|editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}</ref> To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winnick |first= J. |title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=18 May 2007|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|archivedate=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&nbsp;kW) in capacity.\n\n===Seasonal energy efficiency ratio===\n{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|European seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S |title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2 July 2006|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\nIn 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html |website=Sylvane|title=PTAC Buying Guide}}</ref> They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a [[heat pump]]. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Room-size air conditioner fits under window sill |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=63 |issue=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |page=885 |date=June 1935 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Split systems===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\n\n====Mini-split (ductless) system====\n[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Condenser side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\n[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Evaporator, or terminal, side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's. Large systems are known as VRF ([[Variable refrigerant flow]]) systems. Mini split ductless systems were invented by [[Daikin]] in 1973, and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/corporate/overview/summary/history/digest/|title=History of Daikin Innovation |website=daikin.com |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh|title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Cooling & Heating &#124; HVAC|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=17 February 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>{{cite web|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy|date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives\u2014offered in some areas\u2014can help offset the initial expense.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps |publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Multi-split system====\nA multi-split system<ref>{{cite book|title=Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning|last=Trott|first=A.R. |last2=Welch |first2=T. |publisher=Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-4219-X|location=Great Britain|page=312}}</ref> is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts ([[evaporator]] and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\n\nA large Multi Split System is called a [[Variable refrigerant flow]] system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install.\n\n''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':\n\nOther common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\n\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.\n\n=====Multi-split system installation considerations=====\nBefore selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\n\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\n\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\n\n===Air-only central air conditioning===\nCentral [[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]] A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an [[air handler]] and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air.\n\n===Central plant cooling===\n{{see also|Chiller}}\n[[File:Industrial air conditioning unit (DFdB).JPG|thumb|A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower]]\nCentral cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units.\n\n===Portable units===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n====Portable split system====\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/portable-or-split-system-air-conditioning-the-pros-and-cons/|title=Portable Vs Split System Air Conditioning &#124; Pros & Cons|date=August 14, 2018|website=Canstar Blue}}</ref>\n\n====Portable hose system====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose |publisher=Experts123.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n====Portable evaporative system====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable.
