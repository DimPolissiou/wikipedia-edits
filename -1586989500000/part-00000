A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he is most notable for his long service as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\nA native of [[Chicago]], Yates graduated from [[Lake View High School (Chicago)|Lake View High School]] in 1928.  He received bachelor's (1931) and law (1933) degrees from the [[University of Chicago]], was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Chicago.  In addition to working as an attorney, in the 1930s Yates also played semiprofessional basketball.  He gained his initial experience in government as an attorney for the state bank receiver (1935-1937), and an assistant state attorney general specializing in [[Railway electric traction|traction railroads]] for the Illinois Commerce Commission (1937-1940).  During [[World War II]], Yates served in the [[United States Navy]] for two years (1944-1946) as an attorney based in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nIn 1948, Yates was elected to Congress, and he served from 1949 to 1963.  After an unsuccessful run against [[Everett Dirksen]] for the United States Senate in [[1962 United States Senate election in Illinois|1962]], in 1964 Yates was again elected to Congress.  he served from 1965 to 1999, and did not run for reelection in 1998.  He was a longtime member of the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], where he became known for staunch U.S. support of [[Israel]], and federal funding for parks, historical conservation, and the arts.  Yates was also an advocate for several liberal causes, including opposition to discrimination based on age.  At the time he concluded his service, he was the oldest person to ever serve in the House (age 89), and one of the longest-tenured members in the history of Congress (total House service of 48 years).\n\nYates died in Washington in 2000.

He is the longest-serving member ever of the United States House of Representatives from the state of [[Illinois]].\n\n==Career in Congress==\nFrom 1949 to 1963 and 1965 to 1999, Yates served in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]]. Although the boundaries of his district changed over the years, it was always anchored in the Chicago lakefront. From the 1970s onward, Chicago's declining population resulted in the district spilling into the northern suburbs. By the time he retired, his district also included [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]], [[Glenview, Illinois|Glenview]], [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]]. \n\nYates was one of the first congressmen to speak out against age discrimination, arguing in 1951 that mandatory retirement of workers was wrong and deprived older people of their ''right to lead a proud, productive and independent life.''\n\nDuring the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Yates called for legislation to ban automatic-opening or [[switchblade]] knives, proclaiming that \"Vicious fantasies of omnipotence, idolatry...barbaric and sadistic atrocities, and monstrous violations of accepted values spring from the cult of the weapon, and the switchblade knife is included in this.

He briefly served at the [[United Nations]] before returning to the House after the 1964 election. Fellow Democrat [[Edward Rowan Finnegan|Edward Finnegan]] won Yates' old seat after his former district was merged with the 9th, but Chicago machine bosses persuaded him to accept a circuit judgeship in return for letting Yates take his old seat back. Yates served on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] throughout his career and chaired the Interior Subcommittee from 1975 to 1995. On this committee he supported environmental programs and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].\n\nYates remained on good terms with both liberal reformers and machine politicians in Chicago throughout his career. He also served on the Foreign Operations subcommittee and was a strong advocate of American support for [[Israel]]. He worked hand-in-hand with his chief of staff, [[Mary Anderson Bain|Mary Bain]], to preserve federal funding for the arts and for Natural Heritage Preservation programs, and to establish the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]].\n\nIn 1993, he was presented with the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]] by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and in 1997 he received the [[Four Freedoms Award]] for Freedom of Speech<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325223647/http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/four-freedoms-awards |archivedate=2015-03-25 }}</ref> In 1999, the Auditors Building in [[Washington, DC]], was renamed the [[Sidney Yates Building]] in his honor.<ref name=DMUSDA>[http://www.dm.usda.gov/buildings.htm#Yates%20Building Histories of the USDA Headquarters Complex Buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721071326/http://www.dm.usda.gov/buildings.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}, U.S. Department of Agriculture Departmental Management website, accessed July 28, 2011</ref>\n\nIn his closing months of service, he surpassed [[Robert L.

He was created Baron Grosvenor in 1761 and in 1784 became both Viscount Belgrave and Earl Grosvenor.\n\n==Early life==\nRichard Grosvenor was born at [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]], Cheshire, the elder son of [[Sir Robert Grosvenor, 6th Baronet]].  He was educated at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], graduating [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1751 and [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] in 1754. \n\n==Political life==\n\nHe became Member of Parliament for [[City of Chester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester]] in 1754 and continued to represent the city until 1761, when he became Baron Grosvenor and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]].  He was [[mayor#English-Saxon mayors and counterparts|mayor]] of Chester in 1759 and in 1769 he paid for the building of the [[Eastgate and Eastgate Clock|Eastgate]] in the city.  Grosvenor extended his estate by the purchase of the village of [[Belgrave, Cheshire|Belgrave]], and the manor of [[Eccleston, Cheshire|Eccleston]] in 1769.  He succeeded as 7th&nbsp;baronet on the death of his father in 1755.<ref name=dnb>Farrell, S. M.

In 1758 he declared himself in favour of the [[Pitt\u2013Newcastle ministry]] and following this he was created Baron Grosvenor in 1761.  However, when the Tory [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]] became Prime Minister the following year, Grosvenor changed his allegiance.  Then, when Pitt was returned to power in the [[Chatham Ministry]] of 1766\u201368, Grosvenor returned to support him.  During the 1770s he supported [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]].  He voted against [[Charles James Fox|Fox's]] India Bill in 1783 and was rewarded by [[William Pitt the Younger]] with title of Earl Grosvenor the following year.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Personal interests==\nOtherwise, Grosvenor was interested in the acquisition of art and in horse racing with [[Potoooooooo]].  He was also the principal patron of the [[Satire|satirist]] and journalist [[William Gifford]].

He was educated at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], graduating [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1751 and [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] in 1754. \n\n==Political life==\n\nHe became Member of Parliament for [[City of Chester (UK Parliament constituency)|Chester]] in 1754 and continued to represent the city until 1761, when he became Baron Grosvenor and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]].  He was [[mayor#English-Saxon mayors and counterparts|mayor]] of Chester in 1759 and in 1769 he paid for the building of the [[Eastgate and Eastgate Clock|Eastgate]] in the city.  Grosvenor extended his estate by the purchase of the village of [[Belgrave, Cheshire|Belgrave]], and the manor of [[Eccleston, Cheshire|Eccleston]] in 1769.  He succeeded as 7th&nbsp;baronet on the death of his father in 1755.<ref name=dnb>Farrell, S. M.

In 1758 he declared himself in favour of the [[Pitt\u2013Newcastle ministry]] and following this he was created Baron Grosvenor in 1761.  However, when the Tory [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Earl of Bute]] became Prime Minister the following year, Grosvenor changed his allegiance.  Then, when Pitt was returned to power in the [[Chatham Ministry]] of 1766\u201368, Grosvenor returned to support him.  During the 1770s he supported [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]].  He voted against [[Charles James Fox|Fox's]] India Bill in 1783 and was rewarded by [[William Pitt the Younger]] with title of Earl Grosvenor the following year.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Personal interests==\nOtherwise, Grosvenor was interested in the acquisition of art and in horse racing with [[potooooooo]].

A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado rolled a mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home.

A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado rolled a mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. One fatality and one serious injury occurred in the county. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted. Near Tynes Ainsworth Road, a mobile home was completely destroyed; both occupants died.

It operates at two levels: Junior and Senior school as Day and [[Boarding school]]. \n\n==History==\nIt was founded on 4 October 1972 at Km 27, Abeokuta Expressway, Ojokoro, [[Nigeria]]. Signatories were Alhaji K.D. Oshodi and Mr. J.A. Gbadamosi. All the blocks of classrooms were inherited from Ahamadiyya Grade III Teacher's Training College, which closed down in 1996.\n\nIn a letter dated 19 February 1972, the [[Government of Lagos State|Lagos State Government]] through the [[Ministry of Education (Nigeria)|Ministry of Education]] approved the school called Ahmadiyya Girls' High School which was later change to Anwar ul-Islam Girls' High School. The school started with 72 students, four teaching staff, and the principal was Ms. M.A. Ketiku.\n\nOn October 2, 2001, the school was returned to the [[Anwar ul-Islam Movement]] of [[Nigeria]] due to the policy of the [[Lagos State Government]] headed by Governor [[Bola Tinubu|Bola Ahmed Tinubu]] after several years of government control. After the school was returned to the movement, Mrs Akorede B.F. was posted as the principal.\n\n==Structure==\nThe school operates at two levels: Junior and Senior school as Day and Boarding school. The lowest forms, JS I to JS III, make up the [[junior school]]. Students in those forms study for the [[Basic Education Certificate Examination]] (BECE) conducted by the Lagos State Examination Board and taken at the end of their third year. The [[Senior School Certificate Examination]] (SSCE) is the goal of the students in the upper forms.\n\nTwo examination bodies \u2013 [[West African Examinations Council]] (WAEC) and [[National Examination Council (Nigeria)|National Examinations Council]] (NECO) \u2013 are empowered to conduct separately the end-of-course examination.
