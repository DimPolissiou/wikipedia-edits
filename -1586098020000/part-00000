[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4|d4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5|d5]]\n:2. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4|c4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6|e6]]\n\nThis is known as the ''Orthodox Line'' of the Queen's Gambit Declined.<ref>[http://www.eudesign.com/chessops/qgam-03a.htm ChessOps \u2013 QGAM-03A]</ref> When the \"Queen's Gambit Declined\" is mentioned, it is usually assumed to be referring to the Orthodox Line; see \"[[#Other lines|Other lines]]\" below.\n\nThe Orthodox Line can be reached by a number of different {{chessgloss|move orders}}, such as 1.d4 e6 2.c4 d5; 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5; 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4; 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 e6 3.d4; and so on.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n==General concepts==\nPlaying 2...e6 releases Black's dark-squared [[bishop (chess)|bishop]], while obstructing his light-squared bishop. By declining White's temporary [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]], Black erects a solid position; the pawns on d5 and e6 give Black a foothold in the {{chessgloss|centre}}. The Queen's Gambit Declined has the reputation of being one of Black's most reliable defenses to 1.d4. In this situation, White will try to exploit the passivity of Black's light-squared bishop, and Black will try to release it, trade it, or prove that, while passive, the bishop has a useful defensive role.\n\nAn eventual ...dxc4 by Black will surrender the centre to White, and Black will usually not do this unless he can extract a concession, usually in the form of gaining a {{chessgloss|tempo}}, by capturing on c4 only after White has played Bd3 first. In the Orthodox Line, the fight for the tempo revolves around White's efforts to play all other useful developing moves prior to playing Bd3.\n\n==Other lines==\nIn its broadest sense, the Queen's Gambit Declined is any variation of the Queen's Gambit in which Black does not play ...dxc4. Variations other than the Orthodox Line have their own names and are usually treated separately.<ref>[http://www.eudesign.com/chessops/qgam-app.htm ChessOps The Queen's Gambit \u2013 Overview]</ref>\n\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 and eventual ...c6 &ndash; [[Semi-Slav Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 &ndash; [[Slav Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 &ndash; [[Albin Countergambit]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6 &ndash; [[Chigorin Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 Bf5 &ndash; [[Baltic Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 c5 &ndash; [[Symmetrical Defense]] (or Austrian Defense)\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nf6 &ndash; [[Marshall Defense]] (unsound and no longer used by knowledgeable players)\n\nOf the 34 games played in the [[World Chess Championship 1927|1927 World Championship]] between [[Alexander Alekhine]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], all except the first and third began with the Queen's Gambit Declined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1007329|title=WCC Index [Alekhine\u2013Capablanca 1927]|website=Chessgames.com|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Black avoids 3...Nf6==\nAfter [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6/3. Nc3|1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3]] (other third moves are also possible: 3.cxd5 may be played to lead to the Exchange line, 3.Nf3 keeps options open, and 3.g3 will transpose to the [[Catalan Opening|Catalan]]), Black's main move is 3...Nf6, though he has other options as well:\n*'''3... c5''', the [[Tarrasch Defense]], if Black is willing to accept an {{chessgloss|isolani|isolated d-pawn}}.\n*'''3... Be7''', the [[Alatortsev]] Variation.<ref>[[ECO D31|''ECO'' D31]]</ref> At top level, this has recently been played much more often than Nf6. Sometimes, this transposes to positions arising from 3...Nf6, and has the advantage, from Black's standpoint, of avoiding the insidious pressure of the main lines in the Exchange Variation arising after 3...Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 with an annoying pin. In many cases, the game will simply transpose into the main lines after 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Bg5, or, White can now play '''4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4 c6 6. e3''', when 6...Bf5 7.g4 became a topical line after its adoption by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] in his 1963 title match with [[Tigran Petrosian]]. 6.Qc2 is also popular. These exchange lines are more popular than transposing at top level.\n*'''3... c6''', now the [[Semi-Slav Defense]] may be reached via 4.Nf3 Nf6, though 4.e4 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 (6.Nc3 c5 gives little) 6...Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ 8.Be2 leads to a sharp struggle, and 4.Nf3 dxc4 is the [[Noteboom Variation]], also sometimes known as the Abrahams Variation, after the English master, [[Gerald Abrahams]].\n*'''3... Bb4{{chesspunc|?!}}''', confusing a [[Nimzo-Indian]] with a Queen's Gambit (also known as the Berg defense), and at this point an inaccuracy. White has at least two good continuations: 4.Qa4+ Nc6 5.Nf3 where Black is forced to block the c-pawn with the knight, and 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 and White has the bishop pair almost for free (on the average worth half a pawn), since cxd5 is unstoppable and there will be no doubled pawns as a counterbalance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman62.pdf |title=The Most Common Opening Inaccuracies|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=2006-03-15|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>\n*'''3... a6''', the [[Dawid Janowski|Janowski Variation]], is rare and rather passive.\n\n==Black plays 3...Nf6==\nLines beginning with the moves [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6/3.

Bxf6 Bxf6''' this line was extensively tested in the Kasparov&ndash;Karpov matches in 1980s. To this day Black has no problems in this line despite being tested at the highest levels. Most recently Boris Gelfand defended the Black side of this variation in the 2011 candidates matches which eventually he went on to win. For example, in the third round of the final candidate match, he forced White to accept a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in 14 moves with a very strong novelty: [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1622851 Grischuk vs. Gelfand, Elista 2011].\n*'''Lasker Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 h6 7. Bh4 Ne4 8. Bxe7 Qxe7''', is also a solid line, often leading to the exchange of two sets of minor pieces. It was this line that [[Viswanathan Anand]] chose in the final game of the [[World Chess Championship 2010]] in order to defeat [[Veselin Topalov]] and retain the world championship.\n*'''Orthodox Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Rc1 c6''' and now White has two main moves: 8.Bd3 and 8.Qc2. After 8.Bd3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Black has surrendered the centre and stands somewhat cramped, but has succeeded in making White lose a tempo by playing Bd3 before Bxc4. White will try to use his advantage in space to attack, whereas Black will try to keep White at bay while striking back at the centre. Capablanca's main idea here was the freeing maneuver 9...Nd5 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.0-0 Nxc3 12.Rxc3 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5 15.f4 Qe7, which has led to a number of exchanges in the centre, though Black must exercise care even in the wake of this simplification. This line was once so frequently played that it has a separate code (D69) in ''ECO'', though the lack of active counter play for Black has made the main line of the Orthodox a backwater in modern practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Firmian|first=Nick|title=Modern Chess Openings|publisher=Random House|year=1999|edition=14th|isbn=0-8129-3084-3}}</ref>\n\n===Cambridge Springs Defense: 4.Bg5 Nbd7 {{anchor|Cambridge Springs Defense}}===\n{{main|Cambridge Springs Defense}}\nThe Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still played.

Qc2 0-0''' and here 9.Bd3{{chesspunc|??}} loses since 9...dxc4{{chesspunc|!}} (threatening ...Qxg5) 10.Bxf6 cxd3! (a [[zwischenzug]]) 11.Qxd3 Nxf6 wins a piece for Black.\n\n===Exchange Variation: 4.cxd5 exd5 {{anchor|Exchange Variation}}===\n(1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6 6. Qc2''' and White has a pawn majority in the centre, Black has a pawn majority on the {{chessgloss|queenside}}. This pawn structure gives White the opportunity to either advance his pawns in the centre by means of Nge2, f2\u2013f3, followed by e2\u2013e4, or play for a {{chessgloss|minority attack}} by means of the plan Rb1, followed by b2\u2013b4\u2013b5, then bxc6 in order to create a weak pawn at c6. While Black can play ...cxb5, or recapture on c6 with a piece, each of these possibilities are even less desirable than the [[backward pawn]] in the open file. For Black, exchanging at d5 has released his light-squared bishop and opened the e-file, giving him the use of e4 as a springboard for central and {{chessgloss|kingside}} play. While chances are balanced, Black is usually more or less forced to use his superior activity to launch a piece attack on White's [[king (chess)|king]], as the long-term chances in the QGD Exchange structure favour White. The following games are model games for White:\n\n*Central pawn advance: Carlsen vs. Jakovenko, Nanjing 2009<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1559010 Carlsen vs. Jakovenko, Nanjing 2009] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n*Minority attack: Evans vs. Opsahl, Dubrovnik 1950<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1152575 Evans vs. Opsahl, Dubrovnik 1950] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\n===Ragozin Variation: 4.Nf3 Bb4 {{anchor|Ragozin Variation}}===\nThe Ragozin Variation (''ECO'' code D37\u2013D39) occurs after (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6) '''4.

White's pawns or pieces occupy the central squares in exchange for long-term pawn structure weaknesses.

[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4|d4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5|d5]]\n:2. [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4|c4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6|e6]]\n\nThis is known as the ''Orthodox Line'' of the Queen's Gambit Declined.<ref>[http://www.eudesign.com/chessops/qgam-03a.htm ChessOps \u2013 QGAM-03A]</ref> When the \"Queen's Gambit Declined\" is mentioned, it is usually assumed to be referring to the Orthodox Line; see \"[[#Other lines|Other lines]]\" below.\n\nThe Orthodox Line can be reached by a number of different {{chessgloss|move orders}}, such as 1.d4 e6 2.c4 d5; 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5; 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4; 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 e6 3.d4; and so on.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n==General concepts==\nPlaying 2...e6 releases Black's dark-squared [[bishop (chess)|bishop]], while obstructing his light-squared bishop. By declining White's temporary [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifice]], Black erects a solid position; the pawns on d5 and e6 give Black a foothold in the {{chessgloss|centre}}. The Queen's Gambit Declined has the reputation of being one of Black's most reliable defenses to 1.d4. In this situation, White will try to exploit the passivity of Black's light-squared bishop, and Black will try to release it, trade it, or prove that, while passive, the bishop has a useful defensive role.\n\nAn eventual ...dxc4 by Black will surrender the centre to White, and Black will usually not do this unless he can extract a concession, usually in the form of gaining a {{chessgloss|tempo}}, by capturing on c4 only after White has played Bd3 first. In the Orthodox Line, the fight for the tempo revolves around White's efforts to play all other useful developing moves prior to playing Bd3.\n\n==Other lines==\nIn its broadest sense, the Queen's Gambit Declined is any variation of the Queen's Gambit in which Black does not play ...dxc4. Variations other than the Orthodox Line have their own names and are usually treated separately.<ref>[http://www.eudesign.com/chessops/qgam-app.htm ChessOps The Queen's Gambit \u2013 Overview]</ref>\n\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 and eventual ...c6 &ndash; [[Semi-Slav Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 &ndash; [[Slav Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 &ndash; [[Albin Countergambit]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6 &ndash; [[Chigorin Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 Bf5 &ndash; [[Baltic Defense]]\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 c5 &ndash; [[Symmetrical Defense]] (or Austrian Defense)\n*1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nf6 &ndash; [[Marshall Defense]] (unsound and no longer used by knowledgeable players)\n\nOf the 34 games played in the [[World Chess Championship 1927|1927 World Championship]] between [[Alexander Alekhine]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], all except the first and third began with the Queen's Gambit Declined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1007329|title=WCC Index [Alekhine\u2013Capablanca 1927]|website=Chessgames.com|accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Black avoids 3...Nf6==\nAfter [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6/3.

Be7''', the [[Alatortsev]] Variation.<ref>[[ECO D31|''ECO'' D31]]</ref> At top level, this has recently been played much more often than Nf6. Sometimes, this transposes to positions arising from 3...Nf6, and has the advantage, from Black's standpoint, of avoiding the insidious pressure of the main lines in the Exchange Variation arising after 3...Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 with an annoying pin. In many cases, the game will simply transpose into the main lines after 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Bg5, or, White can now play '''4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4 c6 6. e3''', when 6...Bf5 7.g4 became a topical line after its adoption by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] in his 1963 title match with [[Tigran Petrosian]]. 6.Qc2 is also popular. These exchange lines are more popular than transposing at top level.\n*'''3... c6''', now the [[Semi-Slav Defense]] may be reached via 4.Nf3 Nf6, though 4.e4 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 (6.Nc3 c5 gives little) 6...Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ 8.Be2 leads to a sharp struggle, and 4.Nf3 dxc4 is the [[Noteboom Variation]], also sometimes known as the Abrahams Variation, after the English master, [[Gerald Abrahams]].\n*'''3...

White has at least two good continuations: 4.Qa4+ Nc6 5.Nf3 where Black is forced to block the c-pawn with the knight, and 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 and White has the bishop pair almost for free (on the average worth half a pawn), since cxd5 is unstoppable and there will be no doubled pawns as a counterbalance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman62.pdf |title=The Most Common Opening Inaccuracies|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=2006-03-15|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2009-11-16}}</ref>\n*'''3... a6''', the [[Dawid Janowski|Janowski Variation]], is rare and rather passive.\n\n==Black plays 3...Nf6==\nLines beginning with the moves [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. d4/1...d5/2. c4/2...e6/3.

Bxf6 Bxf6''' this line was extensively tested in the Kasparov&ndash;Karpov matches in 1980s. To this day Black has no problems in this line despite being tested at the highest levels. Most recently Boris Gelfand defended the Black side of this variation in the 2011 candidates matches which eventually he went on to win. For example, in the third round of the final candidate match, he forced White to accept a [[draw (chess)|draw]] in 14 moves with a very strong novelty: [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1622851 Grischuk vs. Gelfand, Elista 2011].\n*'''Lasker Defense''': '''5... 0-0 6. e3 h6 7.

Rc1 c6''' and now White has two main moves: 8.Bd3 and 8.Qc2. After 8.Bd3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Black has surrendered the centre and stands somewhat cramped, but has succeeded in making White lose a tempo by playing Bd3 before Bxc4. White will try to use his advantage in space to attack, whereas Black will try to keep White at bay while striking back at the centre. Capablanca's main idea here was the freeing maneuver 9...Nd5 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.0-0 Nxc3 12.Rxc3 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxe5 15.f4 Qe7, which has led to a number of exchanges in the centre, though Black must exercise care even in the wake of this simplification. This line was once so frequently played that it has a separate code (D69) in ''ECO'', though the lack of active counter play for Black has made the main line of the Orthodox a backwater in modern practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=De Firmian|first=Nick|title=Modern Chess Openings|publisher=Random House|year=1999|edition=14th|isbn=0-8129-3084-3}}</ref>\n\n===Cambridge Springs Defense: 4.Bg5 Nbd7 {{anchor|Cambridge Springs Defense}}===\n{{main|Cambridge Springs Defense}}\nThe Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still played.

In 2005, the city's task force on the hospital lands rejected the idea of further housing on the lands and declared that the lands and buildings should be protected and remain as a mental health facility.<ref>City of Coquitlam: [http://www.coquitlam.ca/Residents/About+Coquitlam/Riverview+Hospital+Lands.htm Riverview Hospital Lands] Retrieved on 15 February 2009</ref>\n\n[[Coquitlam Town Centre]], was designated as a \"Regional Town Centre\" under the Metro Vancouver's Livable Region Strategic Plan. The concept of a [[town centre]] for the area dates back to 1975, and is intended to have a high concentration of high-density housing, offices, cultural, entertainment and education facilities to serve major growth areas of the region, served by rapid transit service.<ref name=\"cityprof\" /> It is in the town centre that many public buildings can be found, including City Hall, a branch of the [[Coquitlam Public Library]], [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] station, Coquitlam's main fire hall, the David Lam Campus of [[Douglas College]], the [[Evergreen Cultural Centre]], [[City Centre Aquatic Complex]], [[Town Centre Park]] and [[Percy Perry Stadium]].\n\nIn 1989, the provincial government sold {{convert|570|ha|acre|0}} of [[Secondary forest|second-growth forested]] land on the south slope of [[Eagle Mountain (British Columbia)|Eagle Mountain]], known locally as ''Eagle Ridge'', to developer Wesbild. This resulted in the closure of [[Westwood Motorsport Park]] in 1990, and the creation of [[Westwood Plateau]], which was developed into 4,525 upscale homes, as well as two golf courses.<ref>Wesbild: [http://www.wesbild.com/land_development/westwood_plateau.htm Westwood Plateau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211150526/http://wesbild.com/land_development/westwood_plateau.htm |date=11 February 2009 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2009</ref><ref>e-Tracks: [http://www.etracksonline.co.uk/Features/stories/canadaspioneer.html Westwood Racing Circuit] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917033702/http://www.etracksonline.co.uk/Features/stories/canadaspioneer.html |date=17 September 2009 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2009</ref>\n\nWith development on Westwood Plateau completed and the opening of the [[Eleanor Ward Bridge|David Avenue Connector]] in 2006, Coquitlam's primary urban development has now shifted to Burke Mountain in the northeastern portion of the city.<ref>City of Coquitlam: [http://www.coquitlam.ca/Business/Developing+Coquitlam/Northeast+Coquitlam/David+Avenue+Connector.htm David Avenue Connector] Retrieved on 15 February 2009</ref><ref>Wesbild: [http://www.wesbild.com/land_development/burke_mountain.htm Burke Mountain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211182015/http://wesbild.com/land_development/burke_mountain.htm |date=11 February 2009 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.burkemountainhomes.com Burke Mountain Homes] Retrieved on 21 February 2011</ref>\n\nWith new development of the [[Evergreen Extension]] of the [[Millennium Line]] of the SkyTrain Rapid Transit system which began operation in December 2016, Coquitlam's urban development area has again shifted to Burquitlam and secondly Burke Mountain.

However, unlike other cities in the area, precipitation is especially heavy in Coquitlam due to its proximity to the mountain slopes. With westward air moving off the [[Pacific Ocean]], the air is forced to flow up the [[Coast Mountains]] causing it to cool and condense and fall as precipitation, this process is known as [[orographic precipitation]]. The orographic effect is mainly responsible for the massive {{convert|1969|mm|in|abbr=on}} annual average precipitation that Coquitlam receives each year, with most falling as rainfall in the fall and winter months, with {{convert|316|mm|in|abbr=on}} in November; the summer is usually sunny with minimal precipitation with {{convert|60.7|mm|in|abbr=on}} in July. Although the mild temperatures allow for mostly rain to fall during the winter months, occasionally [[snow]] will fall. With a slightly higher elevation compared to the rest of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam receives an average of {{convert|64.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow each year, with it rarely staying on the ground for a few days, adding to a very intermittent snow cover during the winter season.\n\nCoquitlam is also located in one of the warmest regions in Canada where average mean annual temperature is {{convert|10.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Temperatures are warm during the summer months with an average high of {{convert|22.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, and an average low of {{convert|13.4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in August. During the winter months, the average high is {{convert|5.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, and the average low is {{convert|0.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in December. This relatively mild climate, by Canadian standards, is caused by the warm [[Alaska Current]] offshore and the many mountain ranges preventing the cold arctic air from the rest of Canada from reaching the southwest corner of British Columbia.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=yes\n|single line= Y\n|location= Coquitlam (Burquitlam Vancouver Golf Course) (Elevation: 122m) 1981\u22122010\n| Jan record

However, unlike other cities in the area, precipitation is especially heavy in Coquitlam due to its proximity to the mountain slopes. With westward air moving off the [[Pacific Ocean]], the air is forced to flow up the [[Coast Mountains]] causing it to cool and condense and fall as precipitation, this process is known as [[orographic precipitation]]. The orographic effect is mainly responsible for the massive {{convert|1969|mm|in|abbr=on}} annual average precipitation that Coquitlam receives each year, with most falling as rainfall in the fall and winter months, with {{convert|316|mm|in|abbr=on}} in November; the summer is usually sunny with minimal precipitation with {{convert|60.7|mm|in|abbr=on}} in July. Although the mild temperatures allow for mostly rain to fall during the winter months, occasionally [[snow]] will fall. With a slightly higher elevation compared to the rest of Metro Vancouver, Coquitlam receives an average of {{convert|64.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow each year, with it rarely staying on the ground for a few days, adding to a very intermittent snow cover during the winter season.\n\nCoquitlam is also located in one of the warmest regions in Canada where average mean annual temperature is {{convert|10.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.

This relatively mild climate, by Canadian standards, is caused by the warm [[Alaska Current]] offshore and the many mountain ranges preventing the cold arctic air from the rest of Canada from reaching the southwest corner of British Columbia.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=yes\n|single line= Y\n|location= Coquitlam (Burquitlam Vancouver Golf Course) (Elevation: 122m) 1981\u22122010\n| Jan record

It serves as a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', also directed and co-written by Hooper. It was written by [[L. M. Kit Carson]] and produced by Carson, [[Yoram Globus]], [[Menahem Golan]] and Hooper. Starring [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Caroline Williams]], [[Bill Johnson (film and television actor)|Bill Johnson]], [[Bill Moseley]] and [[Jim Siedow]], the plot follows a radio host victimized and captured by [[Leatherface]] and his cannibalistic family while a former Texas Marshall hunts them down.\n\nDuring its theatrical release, the film grossed $8 million against its $4.7 million budget and became popular on [[home video]]. The sequel received a mixed reception from critics and audiences alike. Positives and negatives referred to its emphasis on black comedy and gore, which departed from the first film's utilized minimal gore, low-budget [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9|v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style and atmosphere to build tension and fear. Director Tobe Hooper decided to focus on its black comedy as he believed this was present in the first film, but was unacknowledged by viewers because of its gritty content. Despite the mixed reception, the film eventually gained a [[cult following]]. It was followed by ''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo high school seniors, Buzz and Rick, race along a desolate stretch of Texas highway, en route to the Texas-OU football game at the Dallas Cotton Bowl. Heavily intoxicated, they use their car phone to call and harass on-air radio DJ Vanita \"Stretch\" Brock. Unable to convince them to hang up, Stretch is forced to keep the line open. While passing a pickup truck, Leatherface emerges from the back of the truck and rips up the roof using his chainsaw. Rick tries shooting Leatherface with his revolver but Leatherface kills Buzz, causing the car to crash, killing Rick.\n\nThe following morning, Lieutenant Boude \"Lefty\" Enright, former Texas Ranger, and uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who were victims of Leatherface and his family years earlier, arrives at the scene of the crime to help solve Buzz and Rick's murders. Lefty has spent the last thirteen years looking into his nephew's disappearance, investigating reports of mysterious chainsaw killings across Texas. He is contacted by Stretch, who brings him a copy of the audio tape that recorded the attack. Lefty asks Stretch to play the tape on her nightly radio show so the public, which had previously mocked his case, will have to listen to him.\n\nLeatherface's family arrive at the radio station, prompted by the nightly radio broadcast of the tape. While preparing to leave for the night, Stretch is confronted by Bobby \"Chop Top\" Sawyer before being attacked by Leatherface. Her coworker L.G. Peters is apparently killed by Chop Top. Leatherface corners Stretch and is about to kill her, but she charms him into sparing her. Leatherface returns to Chop Top and leads him to believe that he has killed Stretch. They then take L.G. to their home, followed by Stretch, who becomes trapped inside the Sawyer home, an abandoned carnival ground decorated with human bones, multi-colored lights, and carnival remnants.\n\nLefty, who has been following their car all along, arrives equipped with chainsaws and trashes the home before he finds Franklin's remains. Meanwhile, Stretch is found by Leatherface, who puts L.G.'s skinned face and hat on her before tying her arms and leaving. Later, L.G. is still alive and frees Stretch before dying. Drayton finds Stretch and the family capture her. Chop Top scolds Leatherface when he finds out that Stretch is still alive. They torture her at the dinner table, but Lefty arrives and saves her before killing Leatherface. Stretch flees the ground, but Chop Top chases her. Drayton, accepting that he and his family have lost, blows up the ground, killing himself, Lefty and the half-dead Grandpa.\n\nChop Top chases Stretch to the top of a rock tower. Stretch grabs a chainsaw held by the corpse of the family's grandmother in a shrine and attacks Chop Top, causing him to fall off the tower to his death.

[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film one star out of four, lambasting the film because it \"goes flat-out from one end to the other, never spending any time on pacing, on timing, on the anticipation of horror. It doesn't even pause to establish the characters; Dennis Hopper has the most thankless task, playing a man who spends the first half of the movie looking distracted and vague, and the second half screaming during chainsaw duels.\" He also commented that it \"has a lot of blood and disembowelment, to be sure, but it doesn't have the terror of the original, the desire to be taken seriously.

As a result, the film was banned in Germany and Singapore, however the [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft]] in Germany later gave the uncut version an 18 rating,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.schnittberichte.com/svds.php?Page=Titel&ID=1715|title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)|publisher=Schnittberichte|language=German|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> and Singapore gave it an R21 (Resticted to under 21) rating after an appeal. When the film was submitted in the United Kingdom to the [[BBFC]] for a certificate, the BBFC notified Cannon, the distributor, that at least 20 to 25 minutes of footage would have to be trimmed in order for the film to be given an 18 rating.

It serves as a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', also directed and co-written by Hooper. It was written by [[L. M. Kit Carson]] and produced by Carson, [[Yoram Globus]], [[Menahem Golan]] and Hooper. Starring [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Caroline Williams]], [[Bill Johnson (film and television actor)|Bill Johnson]], [[Bill Moseley]] and [[Jim Siedow]], the plot follows a radio host victimized and captured by [[Leatherface]] and his cannibalistic family while a former Texas Marshall hunts them down.\n\nDuring its theatrical release, the film grossed $8 million against its $4.7 million budget and became popular on [[home video]]. The sequel received a mixed reception from critics and audiences alike. Positives and negatives referred to its emphasis on black comedy and gore, which departed from the first film's utilized minimal gore, low-budget [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9|v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style and atmosphere to build tension and fear. Director Tobe Hooper decided to focus on its black comedy as he believed this was present in the first film, but was unacknowledged by viewers because of its gritty content. Despite the mixed reception, the film eventually gained a [[cult following]]. It was followed by ''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo high school seniors, Buzz and Rick, race along a desolate stretch of Texas highway, en route to the Texas-OU football game at the Dallas Cotton Bowl. Heavily intoxicated, they use their car phone to call and harass on-air radio DJ Vanita \"Stretch\" Brock. Unable to convince them to hang up, Stretch is forced to keep the line open. While passing a pickup truck, Leatherface emerges from the back of the truck and rips up the roof using his chainsaw. Rick tries shooting Leatherface with his revolver but Leatherface kills Buzz, causing the car to crash, killing Rick.\n\nThe following morning, Lieutenant Boude \"Lefty\" Enright, former Texas Ranger, and uncle of Sally and Franklin Hardesty, who were victims of Leatherface and his family years earlier, arrives at the scene of the crime to help solve Buzz and Rick's murders. Lefty has spent the last thirteen years looking into his nephew's disappearance, investigating reports of mysterious chainsaw killings across Texas. He is contacted by Stretch, who brings him a copy of the audio tape that recorded the attack. Lefty asks Stretch to play the tape on her nightly radio show so the public, which had previously mocked his case, will have to listen to him.\n\nLeatherface's family arrive at the radio station, prompted by the nightly radio broadcast of the tape. While preparing to leave for the night, Stretch is confronted by Bobby \"Chop Top\" Sawyer before being attacked by Leatherface. Her coworker L.G. Peters is apparently killed by Chop Top. Leatherface corners Stretch and is about to kill her, but she charms him into sparing her. Leatherface returns to Chop Top and leads him to believe that he has killed Stretch. They then take L.G. to their home, followed by Stretch, who becomes trapped inside the Sawyer home, an abandoned carnival ground decorated with human bones, multi-colored lights, and carnival remnants.\n\nLefty, who has been following their car all along, arrives equipped with chainsaws and trashes the home before he finds Franklin's remains. Meanwhile, Stretch is found by Leatherface, who puts L.G.'s skinned face and hat on her before tying her arms and leaving. Later, L.G. is still alive and frees Stretch before dying. Drayton finds Stretch and the family capture her. Chop Top scolds Leatherface when he finds out that Stretch is still alive. They torture her at the dinner table, but Lefty arrives and saves her before killing Leatherface. Stretch flees the ground, but Chop Top chases her. Drayton, accepting that he and his family have lost, blows up the ground, killing himself, Lefty and the half-dead Grandpa.\n\nChop Top chases Stretch to the top of a rock tower. Stretch grabs a chainsaw held by the corpse of the family's grandmother in a shrine and attacks Chop Top, causing him to fall off the tower to his death. Stretch shouts in triumph and swings the chainsaw in the air.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Lt.

However, TV previews, theatrical trailers and even posters for the film displayed the written statement: \"Due to the nature of this film, no-one under 17 will be admitted\".\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception to the film was mixed. [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film one star out of four, lambasting the film because it \"goes flat-out from one end to the other, never spending any time on pacing, on timing, on the anticipation of horror. It doesn't even pause to establish the characters; Dennis Hopper has the most thankless task, playing a man who spends the first half of the movie looking distracted and vague, and the second half screaming during chainsaw duels.\" He also commented that it \"has a lot of blood and disembowelment, to be sure, but it doesn't have the terror of the original, the desire to be taken seriously. It's a geek show.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-part-2-1986|title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=August 25, 1986|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s review was similarly negative, stating that \"the film feels as if Hooper himself has nothing but contempt for the original and went out of his way to tear it down.\"<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-part-2/review/120054/|title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 Review|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[AllMovie]]'s review was favorable, writing, \"much-hated at the time of its release, Tobe Hooper's ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'' has aged remarkably well, now playing as a strangely effective if none-too-subtle satire of several facets of '80s excess.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-2-v49207/review |title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 |last=Phipps |first=Keith |work=[[AllMovie]] |accessdate=July 26, 2012|publisher=[[RhythmOne]]}}</ref>\n\n''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2'' holds a 48% approval rating on film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 31 reviews with an average rating of 4.87/10.

When initially released on home video and [[LaserDisc]], it still had no rating. When reissued on home video and on DVD in 2000 by [[MGM Home Entertainment]], it was given an \"R\" rating by the MPAA.\n\nIn a similar way to its predecessor, ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2'' has had a checkered past in regard to its relationship with censors in various countries. As a result, the film was banned in Germany and Singapore, however the [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft]] in Germany later gave the uncut version an 18 rating,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.schnittberichte.com/svds.php?Page=Titel&ID=1715|title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)|publisher=Schnittberichte|language=German|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> and Singapore gave it an R21 (Resticted to under 21) rating after an appeal. When the film was submitted in the United Kingdom to the [[BBFC]] for a certificate, the BBFC notified Cannon, the distributor, that at least 20 to 25 minutes of footage would have to be trimmed in order for the film to be given an 18 rating. Cannon attempted to cut the film, but eventually gave up after numerous re-edited versions failed to pass the BBFC.<ref name=\"BBFC\">{{cite web |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/BBFC%20Annual%20Report%201987.pdf |title=Annual Report 1987 |work=BBFC |accessdate=March 25, 2020}}</ref> The uncut version of the film was eventually given an 18 rating in 2001.\n\nThe film was banned in Australia for 20 years.

During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]] Azerbaijan had subjected Artsakh to a total blockade, which resulted in famine. As reported by the Human Rights Watch,<blockquote>By the winter of  1991-92, as a result of Azerbaijan's three-year economic and transport blockade, Artsakh was without fuel\u2026, electricity, running water, functioning sanitation facilities, communication facilities and most consumer goods.<ref>Human Rights Watch/Helsinki (1992) Bloodshed in the Caucasus: escalation of the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh. New York: Human Rights Watch, p. 12</ref></blockquote> In 1992, the [[United States Congress]] added [[Section 907]] to the [[Freedom Support Act]] of 1992, which banned direct US government support to the government of Azerbaijan. The bill namely stated:  \n<blockquote>United States assistance under this or any other Act may not be provided to the Government of Azerbaijan until the President determines that the Government of Azerbaijan is taking demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref>Freedom Support Act (1992) Section 907: Restrictions on the Assistance to Azerbaijan. Public Law 102-511, Washington DC, 24 October 1992.</ref></blockquote> On 24 October  2001 the [[United States Senate|Senate]] adopted an amendment that would provide the [[President of the United States|President]] with the ability to waive Section 907,<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ115.107 Public Law 107-115]</ref> and he has done so since then.\n\n* 18 May 1992, Armenian forces took [[Lachin]], opening the [[Lachin corridor]] for land communications between NKR and Armenia. However, the corridor was under constant threat from Azerbaijani forces who repeatedly tried to cut it. A strong offensive by Armenian forces occurred in 1993, resulting in the securing of further territory to act as a \"security zone\".\n* 27 March 1993, Armenian forces launched an offensive in [[Kelbajar]] and by 5 April had completely captured the area of [[Kalbajar Rayon]], creating a strong link between Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia and removing from the Lachin corridor the threat of attack from the north.\n* 23 July 1993, after 40 days of fighting, officially known in Armenia as the ''\"suppression of enemy firing points\"'', Agdam was taken. Then followed attack in the south:\n* 22 August 1993 [[Fizuli District|Fizuli]] was taken.\n* 25 August 1993 - [[Jebrail]] was taken.\n* 31 August 1993 - [[Kubatly]] was taken.\n* 1 November 1993 - [[Zangelan]] was taken.\n\nDuring this phase of the war, Azerbaijan would not agree to sign a ceasefire until after these territories passed under the Armenian control and there was a danger that Armenians would advance further to take territories of vital importance for Azerbaijan.<ref name=Kazimirov/><ref>Patrick Wilson Gore 2008. 'Tis some poor fellow's skull: post-Soviet warfare in the southern Caucasus</ref> As described by Russian mediator Vladimir Kazimirov, \n<blockquote>Azerbaijan for too long a time was counting on military solution of the problem\u2026 those who for more than a year (1993-1994) ignored the UN Resolutions that called for the ceasefire\u2026 were supposed to realise their direct responsibility for the consequences \u2013 for the loss of more regions and the increasing the number of refugees and IDPs.<ref name=Kazimirov>Kazimirov Vladimir (2007) \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0445\u0435?

In addition, since that time, Armenians have controlled all of the territory between the former NKAO to Iran, as well as all of the territory between the former NKAO and Armenia, and some areas to the east surrounding Aghdam. Nagorno-Karabakh also claims but does not control the region known until 1992 as [[Shahumian]], which although being majority-Armenian before 1992, was not part of the NKAO. Shahumian's Armenian population was driven out during the war, and the Armenian and Azeri forces have been separated on the northern front by the [[Murovdag]] mountain chain ever since.<ref>[http://www.nr2.ru/kavkaz/95299.html/print/ \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0445 \u2014 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nSince 1994, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] have held talks on the future of the security belt territories.

During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]] Azerbaijan had subjected Artsakh to a total blockade, which resulted in famine. As reported by the Human Rights Watch,<blockquote>By the winter of  1991-92, as a result of Azerbaijan's three-year economic and transport blockade, Artsakh was without fuel\u2026, electricity, running water, functioning sanitation facilities, communication facilities and most consumer goods.<ref>Human Rights Watch/Helsinki (1992) Bloodshed in the Caucasus: escalation of the armed conflict in Nagorno Karabakh. New York: Human Rights Watch, p. 12</ref></blockquote> In 1992, the [[United States Congress]] added [[Section 907]] to the [[Freedom Support Act]] of 1992, which banned direct US government support to the government of Azerbaijan. The bill namely stated:  \n<blockquote>United States assistance under this or any other Act may not be provided to the Government of Azerbaijan until the President determines that the Government of Azerbaijan is taking demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref>Freedom Support Act (1992) Section 907: Restrictions on the Assistance to Azerbaijan. Public Law 102-511, Washington DC, 24 October 1992.</ref></blockquote> On 24 October  2001 the [[United States Senate|Senate]] adopted an amendment that would provide the [[President of the United States|President]] with the ability to waive Section 907,<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ115.107 Public Law 107-115]</ref> and he has done so since then.\n\n* 18 May 1992, Armenian forces took [[Lachin]], opening the [[Lachin corridor]] for land communications between NKR and Armenia. However, the corridor was under constant threat from Azerbaijani forces who repeatedly tried to cut it. A strong offensive by Armenian forces occurred in 1993, resulting in the securing of further territory to act as a \"security zone\".\n* 27 March 1993, Armenian forces launched an offensive in [[Kelbajar]] and by 5 April had completely captured the area of [[Kalbajar Rayon]], creating a strong link between Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia and removing from the Lachin corridor the threat of attack from the north.\n* 23 July 1993, after 40 days of fighting, officially known in Armenia as the ''\"suppression of enemy firing points\"'', Agdam was taken. Then followed attack in the south:\n* 22 August 1993 [[Fizuli]] was taken.\n* 25 August 1993 - [[Jebrail]] was taken.\n* 31 August 1993 - [[Kubatly]] was taken.\n* 1 November 1993 - [[Zangelan]] was taken.\n\nDuring this phase of the war, Azerbaijan would not agree to sign a ceasefire until after these territories passed under the Armenian control and there was a danger that Armenians would advance further to take territories of vital importance for Azerbaijan.<ref name=Kazimirov/><ref>Patrick Wilson Gore 2008.

In addition, since that time, Armenians have controlled all of the territory between the former NKAO to Iran, as well as all of the territory between the former NKAO and Armenia, and some areas to the east surrounding Aghdam. Nagorno-Karabakh also claims but does not control the region known until 1992 as [[Shahumian]], which although being majority-Armenian before 1992, was not part of the NKAO. Shahumian's Armenian population was driven out during the war, and the Armenian and Azeri forces have been separated on the northern front by the [[Murovdag]] mountain chain ever since.<ref>[http://www.nr2.ru/kavkaz/95299.html/print/ \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0445 \u2014 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n\nSince 1994, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] have held talks on the future of the security belt territories.

Spender said at various times throughout his life that he never passed an exam, ever. Perhaps his closest friend and the man who had the biggest influence on him was [[W. H. Auden]], who introduced him to [[Christopher Isherwood]]. The earliest version of [[Poems (Auden)|''Poems'']] written by Auden was hand-printed by Spender. He left Oxford without taking a degree and in 1929 he moved to [[Hamburg]]. Isherwood invited him to come to Berlin. Every six months Spender went back to England.\n\nSpender was acquainted with fellow [[Auden Group]] members [[Louis MacNeice]], [[Edward Upward]] and [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].  He was friendly with [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] and later came to know [[William Butler Yeats|W. B.

Eliot]], as well as members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], in particular [[Virginia Woolf]].\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Stephen spender.jpg|thumb|Stephen Spender]]\n\nSpender began work on a novel in 1929, which was not published until 1988, under the title ''[[The Temple (novel)|The Temple]]''.  The novel is about a young man who travels to Germany and finds a culture at once more open than England's\u2014particularly about relationships between men\u2014and showing frightening anticipations of Nazism, which are confusingly related to the very openness the main character admires.  Spender says in his 1988 introduction:\n\n<blockquote>In the late Twenties young English writers were more concerned with censorship than with politics... 1929 was the last year of that strange Indian Summer\u2014the Weimar Republic.  For many of my friends and for myself, Germany seemed a paradise where there was no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom in their lives...<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bozorth | first=Richard R. | title=But Who Would Get It?

Living in Vienna his convictions found further expression in ''Forward from Liberalism'' and in ''Vienna'' (1934), a long poem in praise of the [[July Putsch|1934 uprising]] of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austrian socialists]], and in ''Trial of a Judge''<ref name=\"questia.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=28562871|title=Trial of a Judge: A Tragedy in Five Acts|work=questia.com|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> (1938), an [[anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|drama in verse]].\n\nAt Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, that had published the first edition of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', historic figures made rare appearances, readings of their work: Paul Valery, Andre Gide, and T.S.

In 1937, during the [[Spanish civil war]], the ''Daily Worker'' sent him to Spain. His mission was to observe and report on the Soviet ship Komsomol, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Spender travelled to [[Tangier]] and tried to enter the country via [[Cadiz]], but he was sent back. Then he travelled to Valencia and met [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Manuel Altolaguirre]]. (Tony Hyndman, alias Jimmy Younger had joined the [[International Brigade]] who were fighting against [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Guadalajara]].)  <!--Pollitt told Spender \"to go and get killed; we need a [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] in the movement\".{{citation needed|date=May 2007}}--> Spender was imprisoned for a while in [[Albacete]].

Spender's second wife, [[Natasha Spender|Natasha]], whom he married in 1941, was also Jewish. In 1942 he joined as a volunteer the fire brigade of [[Cricklewood]] and Maresfield Gardens. Spender met several times with the poet [[Edwin Muir]].\n\nA member of the political left wing during this early period, he was one of those who wrote of their disillusionment with [[communism]] in the essay collection ''[[The God that Failed]]'' (1949), along with [[Arthur Koestler]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7522|title=Stephen Spender|work=poetryarchive.org}}</ref> It is thought that one of the big areas of disappointment was the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] between [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany and [[Stalinist]] Russia, which many leftists saw as a betrayal. Like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and several other outspoken opponents of fascism in the 1930s, Spender did not see active military service in [[World War II]].  He was initially graded \"C\" upon examination due to his earlier [[colitis]], poor eyesight, [[varicose veins]], and the long-term effects of a [[tapeworm]] in 1934. However, he contrived by pulling strings to be re-examined and was upgraded to \"B\" which meant that he could serve in the London [[Auxiliary Fire Service]].

Spender said at various times throughout his life that he never passed an exam, ever. Perhaps his closest friend and the man who had the biggest influence on him was [[W. H. Auden]], who introduced him to [[Christopher Isherwood]]. The earliest version of [[Poems (Auden)|''Poems'']] written by Auden was hand-printed by Spender. He left Oxford without taking a degree and in 1929 he moved to [[Hamburg]]. Isherwood invited him to come to Berlin. Every six months Spender went back to England.\n\nSpender was acquainted with fellow [[Auden Group]] members [[Louis MacNeice]], [[Edward Upward]] and [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].  He was friendly with [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] and later came to know [[William Butler Yeats|W. B.

Eliot]], as well as members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], in particular [[Virginia Woolf]].\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Stephen spender.jpg|thumb|Stephen Spender]]\n\nSpender began work on a novel in 1929, which was not published until 1988, under the title ''[[The Temple (novel)|The Temple]]''.  The novel is about a young man who travels to Germany and finds a culture at once more open than England's\u2014particularly about relationships between men\u2014and showing frightening anticipations of Nazism, which are confusingly related to the very openness the main character admires.  Spender says in his 1988 introduction:\n\n<blockquote>In the late Twenties young English writers were more concerned with censorship than with politics... 1929 was the last year of that strange Indian Summer\u2014the Weimar Republic.  For many of my friends and for myself, Germany seemed a paradise where there was no censorship and young Germans enjoyed extraordinary freedom in their lives...<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bozorth | first=Richard R. | title=But Who Would Get It?

Living in Vienna his convictions found further expression in ''Forward from Liberalism'' and in ''Vienna'' (1934), a long poem in praise of the [[July Putsch|1934 uprising]] of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austrian socialists]], and in ''Trial of a Judge''<ref name=\"questia.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=28562871|title=Trial of a Judge: A Tragedy in Five Acts|work=questia.com|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> (1938), an [[anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|drama in verse]].\n\nAt Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, that had published the first edition of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', historic figures made rare appearances, readings of their work: Paul Valery, Andre Gide, and T.S.

In 1937, during the [[Spanish civil war]], the ''Daily Worker'' sent him to Spain. His mission was to observe and report on the Soviet ship Komsomol, which had sunk while carrying Soviet weapons to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Spender travelled to [[Tangier]] and tried to enter the country via [[Cadiz]], but he was sent back. Then he travelled to Valencia and met [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Manuel Altolaguirre]]. (Tony Hyndman, alias Jimmy Younger had joined the [[International Brigade]] who were fighting against [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Guadalajara]].)  <!--Pollitt told Spender \"to go and get killed; we need a [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] in the movement\".{{citation needed|date=May 2007}}--> Spender was imprisoned for a while in [[Albacete]].

Spender's second wife, [[Natasha Spender|Natasha]], whom he married in 1941, was also Jewish. In 1942 he joined as a volunteer the fire brigade of [[Cricklewood]] and Maresfield Gardens. Spender met several times with the poet [[Edwin Muir]].\n\nA member of the political left wing during this early period, he was one of those who wrote of their disillusionment with [[communism]] in the essay collection ''[[The God that Failed]]'' (1949), along with [[Arthur Koestler]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7522|title=Stephen Spender|work=poetryarchive.org}}</ref> It is thought that one of the big areas of disappointment was the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] between [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany and [[Stalinist]] Russia, which many leftists saw as a betrayal. Like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and several other outspoken opponents of fascism in the 1930s, Spender did not see active military service in [[World War II]].  He was initially graded \"C\" upon examination due to his earlier [[colitis]], poor eyesight, [[varicose veins]], and the long-term effects of a [[tapeworm]] in 1934.
