The first case was identified on 9 March,<ref name=\"firstcase\"/> and transmission within the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 24 March.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> As of 14 April, there have been 223 cases identified in the Bailiwick, all in Guernsey,{{refn|group=note|'Guernsey' refers to the entire jurisdiction of Guernsey, which includes the island of Guernsey as well as the three inhabited islands of [[Herm]], [[Jethou]] and [[Lihou]].}} and 7 people are confirmed to have died from the infection.{{refn|group=note|The States of Guernsey has also recorded (separately) 3 'presumptive' deaths presumed to be due to COVID-19.}}\n\nThe [[States of Guernsey]] response is led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA), a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island, chaired by [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey#List of heads of government of Guernsey|Chief Minister]] [[Gavin St Pier]]. St Pier has compared the threat to public health posed by the pandemic and the restriction of personal liberties as a result of the lockdown measures in the Bailiwick to that seen during the [[second world war]].<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news |title=Coronavirus: Guernsey urges self-isolation with any symptoms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-51818817?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world/europe/guernsey&link_location=live-reporting-story |accessdate=19 March 2020 |work=bbc.co.uk |agency=BBC |publisher=BBC News |date=12 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Strict new measures come into force from midnight tonight |url=https://www.gov.gg/covid19newmeasures |website=gov.gg |date=24 March 2020 |publisher=States of Guernsey}}</ref>\n\nEarly response measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days.

She did similar work with her brother Maurice Wilson in [[North Africa]] before moving in February 1919 to distribute food and clothing in [[Ni\u0161]], [[Grdelica]], and [[Belgrade]]. Her first book, ''Portraits and Sketches of Serbia'' (1920) aimed to publicize Serbia's need for post-war relief. From 1919 to 1922 Wilson worked with [[Hilda Clark (doctor)|Hilda Clark]] and [[Edith Pye]] for the [[Quaker Relief Mission]] in [[Vienna]], acting as an interpreter and organizing food depots. After meeting the art educator [[Franz Ci\u017eek]], she organized an exhibition of child art by his pupils, raising money for the recently founded [[Save the Children Fund]]. The exhibition toured the UK and the US.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nIn 1925 Wilson took up a job at the [[Edgbaston Church of England College for Girls]]. She opened her house in [[Edgbaston]] to a succession of refugee children:\n{{quote|any house that Francesca owned, however spacious, ended up crowded from cellar to attic with delightful, deserving people, the owner's territory having shrunk in no time to a more or less poky bed-sittingroom.<ref>[[Elsie Duncan-Jones]], obituary, ''Newnham College Roll Letter'' (January 1982), pp.61-3.

In 1929 she travelled to [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to report for the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF). Her report was delivered to the WILPF's Sixth Iternational Congress in [[Prague]] in August 1929, and published as ''Yugoslavian Macedonia'' (1930). In the early 1930s she regularly travelled to Germany, visiting her sister Muriel, whose husband Pallister Barkas was a lecturer at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].<ref name=\"BrasterSimon2014\">{{cite book|editor1=Sjaak Braster|editor2=Frank Simon|editor3=Ian Grosvenor|last=Roberts|first=Sian|title=A History of Popular Education: Educating the People of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMboBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-84995-7|pages=155\u2013172|chapter=\"I promised them that I would tell England about them\": a woman teacher activist's life in popular humanitarian education}}</ref> She became increasingly worried about fascism, and opened her house to refugees including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].

Trying to help Czechs with false identity papers to join the French army, she was at one point arrested by Hungarian secret police on the Romanian border, and in May 1940 she returned to England.

She was educated at the [[Central Newcastle High School for Girls]] and [[Armstrong College (Durham University)|Armstrong College]] before studying history at [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. She gained a Cambridge teachers' certificate in 1912, before teaching at [[Bath High School]] and [[Gravesend County School for Girls]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nIn 1914 Wilson met Belgian refugees in [[Gravesend]], and decided to suspend her teaching to take up relief work:\n{{quote|My urge to do relief work was not high-minded and [[Ruth Fry]], who interviewed me, rightly sensed that my motives were selfish. I began without dedication or any desire (except the vaguest) to do good. I wanted foreign travel, adventure, romance, the unknown.<ref>Horder et al, ''Francesca Wilson'', p.105. Quoted in Oldfield, p. 279.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1916 Wilson worked with French evacuee children at [[Samo\u00ebns]] in the [[Haute-Savoie]], moving to [[Corsica]] the following year with the [[Serbian Relief Fund]]. She did similar work with her brother Maurice Wilson in [[North Africa]] before moving in February 1919 to distribute food and clothing in [[Ni\u0161]], [[Grdelica]], and [[Belgrade]]. Her first book, ''Portraits and Sketches of Serbia'' (1920) aimed to publicize Serbia's need for post-war relief. From 1919 to 1922 Wilson worked with [[Hilda Clark]] and [[Edith Pye]] for the [[Quaker Relief Mission]] in [[Vienna]], acting as an interpreter and organizing food depots. After meeting the art educator [[Franz Ci\u017eek]], she organized an exhibition of child art by his pupils, raising money for the recently founded [[Save the Children Fund]]. The exhibition toured the UK and the US.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nIn 1925 Wilson took up a job at the [[Edgbaston Church of England College for Girls]]. She opened her house in [[Edgbaston]] to a succession of refugee children:\n{{quote|any house that Francesca owned, however spacious, ended up crowded from cellar to attic with delightful, deserving people, the owner's territory having shrunk in no time to a more or less poky bed-sittingroom.<ref>[[Elsie Duncan-Jones]], obituary, ''Newnham College Roll Letter'' (January 1982), pp.61-3. Quoted in Oldfield, p.280.</ref>}} The white Russian refugee scholar [[Nikolai Bachtin]] (1896\u20131950) became a close friend, and lodgers included the biologist [[Maurice Wilkins]]. In 1929 she travelled to [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to report for the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WILPF). Her report was delivered to the WILPF's Sixth Iternational Congress in [[Prague]] in August 1929, and published as ''Yugoslavian Macedonia'' (1930). In the early 1930s she regularly travelled to Germany, visiting her sister Muriel, whose husband Pallister Barkas was a lecturer at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].<ref name=\"BrasterSimon2014\">{{cite book|editor1=Sjaak Braster|editor2=Frank Simon|editor3=Ian Grosvenor|last=Roberts|first=Sian|title=A History of Popular Education: Educating the People of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMboBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-84995-7|pages=155\u2013172|chapter=\"I promised them that I would tell England about them\": a woman teacher activist's life in popular humanitarian education}}</ref> She became increasingly worried about fascism, and opened her house to refugees including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]].

Trying to help Czechs with false identity papers to join the French army, she was at one point arrested by Hungarian secret police on the Romanian border, and in May 1940 she returned to England. She worked for refugee organizations in the UK until 1945, when she joined the new [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), working with displaced survivors of [[Dachau concentration camp]] outside [[Munich]].<ref name=ODNB/>\n\nFor the remainder of her life Wilson lived in [[London]], teaching adult education classes at the [[University of London]] and for the [[Workers' Educational Association]].

Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].\n\nThe site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century, after the battle of Trafalgar, involving 2 billion chromosomes spent by Filthy Frank and Pink Guy's army, and 5 billion chromosomes spent by Chin Chin's army. Although Chin Chin's army was greater, Frank and Pink Guy defeated Chin Chin fairly quickly. Trafalgar Square originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]]. After [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved the mews to [[Buckingham Palace]], the area was redeveloped by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.\n\nThe square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.\n\n== Name ==\nThe square is named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]], southwest Spain, although it was not named as such until 1835.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}\n\nThe name \"Trafalgar\" is a [[Arabic language influence on the Spanish language|Spanish word]] of [[List of English words of Arabic origin|Arabic origin]], derived from either ''Taraf al-Ghar'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631}} 'cape of the cave/laurel')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215174601/http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 December 2004|title=2|date=15 December 2004}}</ref><ref>[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=algar Entry ''algar''], in [[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|''DRAE'' dictionary]]</ref><ref name='burton'/> or ''Taraf al-Gharb'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628}} 'cape of the west').<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph E.

Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], the [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] over France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].\n\nThe site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]]. After [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved the mews to [[Buckingham Palace]], the area was redeveloped by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.\n\nThe square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.\n\n== Name ==\nThe square is named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]], southwest Spain, although it was not named as such until 1835.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}\n\nThe name \"Trafalgar\" is a [[Arabic language influence on the Spanish language|Spanish word]] of [[List of English words of Arabic origin|Arabic origin]], derived from either ''Taraf al-Ghar'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631}} 'cape of the cave/laurel')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215174601/http://web.usal.es/~joluin/historiadelalengua/toponimos.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 December 2004|title=2|date=15 December 2004}}</ref><ref>[http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=algar Entry ''algar''], in [[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de la Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|''DRAE'' dictionary]]</ref><ref name='burton'/> or ''Taraf al-Gharb'' ({{lang|ar|\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628}} 'cape of the west').<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph E.

The sport's [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of [[logo#Sports|logos]] displayed on shirts and stating that, in the event of a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to [[away colours|different coloured attire]].\n\nFootballers generally wear identifying [[Squad number (association football)|numbers]] on the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.\n\nFootball kit has evolved significantly since the early days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for [[fan (person)|fans]] to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n=== Basic equipment ===\n[[File:Schienbeinsch\u00fctzer adidas.png|thumb|right|120px|Shin pads are compulsory under the Laws of the Game]]\nThe [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] set out the basic equipment which must be worn by all players in Law 4: The Players' Equipment.

The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along with the need for the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 [[the Football League]], which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available.<ref name=\"HFK\" /> Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.<ref name=\"Enc2\">{{cite book\n  | last=Cox\n  | first=Richard\n|author2=Dave Russell |author3=Wray Vamplew\n   | title=Encyclopedia of British Football\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=2002\n|isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8\n|page=74}}</ref>\n\nSpecialised football boots began to emerge in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading [[the Football Association]] to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs.

Initially it was specified that goalkeepers' shirts must be either scarlet or royal blue, but when green was added as a third option in 1912 it caught on to the extent that soon almost every goalkeeper was playing in green.

Nedv\u011bd.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pavel Nedv\u011bd]] pictured in 2006 wearing a typical modern football kit]]\nIn [[association football]], '''kit''' (also referred to as a '''strip''' or '''uniform''') is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of [[logo#Sports|logos]] displayed on shirts and stating that, in the event of a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to [[away colours|different coloured attire]].\n\nFootballers generally wear identifying [[Squad number (association football)|numbers]] on the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.\n\nFootball kit has evolved significantly since the early days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for [[fan (person)|fans]] to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n=== Basic equipment ===\n[[File:Schienbeinsch\u00fctzer adidas.png|thumb|right|120px|Shin pads are compulsory under the Laws of the Game]]\nThe [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] set out the basic equipment which must be worn by all players in Law 4: The Players' Equipment.

The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along with the need for the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 [[the Football League]], which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available.<ref name=\"HFK\" /> Initially the home team was required to change colours in the event of a clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.<ref name=\"Enc2\">{{cite book\n  | last=Cox\n  | first=Richard\n|author2=Dave Russell |author3=Wray Vamplew\n   | title=Encyclopedia of British Football\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=2002\n|isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8\n|page=74}}</ref>\n\nSpecialised football boots began to emerge in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading [[the Football Association]] to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs.

Initially it was specified that goalkeepers' shirts must be either scarlet or royal blue, but when green was added as a third option in 1912 it caught on to the extent that soon almost every goalkeeper was playing in green.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

German identity and the problem of history. ''History and ethnicity'', p.146</ref>\n\nPan-Germanism's origins began in the early 19th century following the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.\n\n===1871\u20131918===\n{{Further|Unification of Germany}}\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\nBy the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire. [[German nationalism in Austria]] grew among all social circles of the empire, many wanted to be unified with the German Reich to form a [[Greater Germany]] and wanted policies to be carried out to enforce their German ethnic identity rejecting any Austrian pan-ethnic identity.<ref name=\"DPSO\">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in \u00d6sterreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423112116/http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | archive-date=23 April 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many German Austrians felt annoyed that they were excluded from the German Empire since it included various non-German ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Urspr\u00fcnge, Anf\u00e4nge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&pg=PA41 |isbn=9783825230760 }}</ref> Prominent Austrian pan-Germans such as [[Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer]]  created pan-German movements which demanded the annexation of all ethnic German territories.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]].

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states. The new German nationalists, mostly young reformers such as Johann Tillmann of [[East Prussia]], sought to unite all the German-speaking and ethnic-German (Volksdeutsche) people.\n\n===1871\u20131918===\n{{Further|Unification of Germany}}\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria\u2013Hungary, 1910]]\nBy the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] were the two most powerful nations dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Many palaces and churches were built by the most important architects of the time, such as [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], who often chose to move into the street. They were joined by several noble families, while European nations and Italian city-states chose to build their churches in the street or in the immediate vicinity.\n\nIn the [[Baroque|Baroque period]] the building activity, directed by the most important architects of the time such as [[Francesco Borromini]], [[Carlo Maderno]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]], continued unabated, while the street, favorite location of the Roman nobles, became the theatre of tournaments, parties and carnival parades. During this period the popes and private patrons continued to take care of the road by founding charitable institutions and providing the area with drinking water.\n\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, the shift of the city centre towards the [[Campo Marzio]] caused the stop of building activity and the abandonment of the road by the nobles. These were replaced by an artisan population with its workshops, and Via Giulia took on the solitary and solemn aspect that would have characterized it for two centuries. During the [[Fascist era|Fascist period]] some construction projects broke the unity of the road in its central section, and the damage has not yet been repaired. Despite this, Via Giulia remains one of Rome's richest roads in art and history, and after a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\", a name common to many roads in medieval Rome).<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the ''[[Via Aurelia]]'' and the ''[[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]]'' roads towards the centre of the city. The Pope intended for it to reach ''Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]'' and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of ''Ripa Grande'']].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new ''[[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]]'' that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the ''Lungara'' and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

Many palaces and churches were built by the most important architects of the time, such as [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], who often chose to move into the street. They were joined by several noble families, while European nations and Italian city-states chose to build their churches in the street or in the immediate vicinity.\n\nIn the [[Baroque|Baroque period]] the building activity, directed by the most important architects of the time such as [[Francesco Borromini]], [[Carlo Maderno]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]], continued unabated, while the street, favorite location of the Roman nobles, became the theatre of tournaments, parties and carnival parades. During this period the popes and private patrons continued to take care of the road by founding charitable institutions and providing the area with drinking water.\n\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, the shift of the city centre towards the [[Campo Marzio]] caused the stop of building activity and the abandonment of the road by the nobles. These were replaced by an artisan population with its workshops, and Via Giulia took on the solitary and solemn aspect that would have characterized it for two centuries. During the [[Fascist era|Fascist period]] some construction projects broke the unity of the road in its central section, and the damage has not yet been repaired. Despite this, Via Giulia remains one of Rome's richest roads in art and history, and after a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\", a name common to many roads in medieval Rome).<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

The Pope intended for it to reach ''Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]'' and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of ''Ripa Grande'']].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new ''[[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]]'' that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the ''Lungara'' and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.
