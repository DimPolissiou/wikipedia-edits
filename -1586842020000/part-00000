The residents approved Dearborn Heights incorporation on an election held June 20, 1960, which is the official date of incorporation.  [[Inkster, Michigan|Inkster]], a predominantly black community, filed a lawsuit, claiming that the shape of Dearborn Heights reflected a racial [[gerrymander]].

Incorporation petitions were filed on Friday, March 4, 1960, while Inkster officials delivered their petitions for incorporation on Monday, March 7, 1960.  The residents approved Dearborn Heights incorporation on an election held June 20, 1960, which is the official date of incorporation.  [[Inkster, Michigan|Inkster]], a predominantly black community, filed a lawsuit, claiming that the shape of Dearborn Heights reflected a racial [[gerrymander]].

Fillmore's name now graces the continuing education school Millard Fillmore College on the South campus as well as the Millard Fillmore Academic Center, an academic and administrative services building at the core of the residential Joseph Ellicott Complex, on the North Campus.\n\n[[File:Pub Scene Singing Alma Mater.jpg|thumb|left|270px|1907 Pub Scene, students singing]]\nInitially, the university did not have its own facilities, and early lectures were given at an old post office on Seneca and Washington streets in Buffalo. The first building specially built for the university was a stone structure at the corner of Main and Virginia streets, built in 1849\u201350, through donations, public subscription, and a state grant.<ref name=\"Hough2\"/> There were continuous expansions to the college medical programs, including a separate pharmacy division, which is now The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In 1887, a law school was organized in Buffalo, which quickly became associated with [[Niagara University]] just to the north of Buffalo. After four years, in 1891, the law school was acquired by the University of Buffalo as the [[University at Buffalo Law School|University of Buffalo Law School]], which had a downtown Buffalo facility. In the first few years of the 20th century, the University began planning for a comprehensive undergraduate college to complete the basic structure of a university, and in 1909 the University acquired the Erie County Almshouse grounds from the county of Erie, which became the University of Buffalo's initial campus. The establishment may have been influenced by the 1910 [[Flexner Report]] which criticized the preparation of the medical students at the university.<ref name=\"Why Innovation Fails\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8oBj_cr9zkwC&pg=PA29&dq=University+at+Buffalo+College+of+Arts+%26+Sciences#v=onepage&q=University%20at%20Buffalo%20College%20of%20Arts%20%26%20Sciences&f=false |title=Why Innovation Fails |first=Arthur |last=Levine |isbn=9780873954129 |date=January 1980}}</ref> With that additional space, in 1915, the then University of Buffalo formed the [[University at Buffalo College of Arts & Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]], creating an undergraduate division in addition to its prior educational work in the licensed professional fields. In 1916, Grace Millard Knox pledged $500,000 for the establishment of a \"department of liberal arts and sciences in the University of Buffalo\", which was at the time still a private institution. The initial gift of $100,000 was for the purchase of what would become Townsend Hall and the remainder was to establish the university's first endowment, in her husband's name, to support the department.<ref name=\"A History of the University of Buffalo\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofunivers01park|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofunivers01park/page/81 81] |quote=University at Buffalo College of Arts & Sciences. |title=A History of the University of Buffalo |publisher=J.

In 1956, a [[Civil Engineering]] Department was formed under [[Lehigh University]] graduate [[Robert L. Ketter]], who went on to become Dean of the [[University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and later President of the University. In 1959, [[WBFO]] was launched as an AM radio station by [[University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern [[National Public Radio]] personalities: [[Terri Gross]] and [[Ira Flatow]]. In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.\n\n===Acquisition by the SUNY system and second campus===\nThe private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system in 1962, and became known as the State University of New York at Buffalo. This acquisition was championed by then-Governor of New York, [[Nelson Rockefeller]].<ref>{{cite web |title=SUNY Buffalo School of Management History |url=https://mgt.buffalo.edu/about/history.html |year=2017 |publisher=University at Buffalo |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref> As a part of the agreement to merge the university into the SUNY system, the state began to build an extensive second campus for the university. In 1964, the state acquired several hundred acres in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] on the northeast of Buffalo, for development as a comprehensive campus for most of the non-medical disciplines at the University at Buffalo. This is often called the North Campus; it is the center of most University at Buffalo activities. The North Campus project included several major buildings, dormitory complexes, a separate spur of the interstate highway, and a new lake. The undergraduate college, the law school, and graduate schools were all moved to the new campus. During the late 1960s, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate schools: arts and letters, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. During the 1998\u20131999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences, when the faculties of Arts and Letters, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics were combined, according to a memorandum issued by the State University of New York.<ref name=\"SUNY memo\">{{cite web |url=http://system.suny.edu/media/suny/content-assets/documents/capital-facilities/campus-let-/tools/Campus-Administered-Procedures_April-2015.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding |accessdate=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince 1989, UB has been a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), an organization of 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada.

UB 2020 also recognizes the university's contribution to the surrounding region. The most recent estimates of UB's impact on the local and regional economies of Western New York report approximately $1.7 billion are brought into the local economy from the presence of UB. This figure is also expected to rise by 40 percent, corresponding with UB's institutional growth.\n\nOne of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan, proponents say, is the passage of S2020 and A2020 known as the UB 2020 Flexibility and Economic Growth Act, by the New York State Legislature.

In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities. Connecting all three campuses, as well as the facilities UB uses, is also a major element of the project. The firm granted the contract to lead the project is [[Beyer Blinder Belle]].\n\nThe comprehensive physical planning process is broken into four phases. Currently, UB is implementing \"phase one\" by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion. The project recognizes UB's potential for excellence, in regard to the university's physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/ub2020/plan/forum_event.html|title=Forums on UB's Physical Plan \u2013 UB 2020|publisher=Buffalo.edu|accessdate=November 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529220050/http://www.buffalo.edu/ub2020/plan/forum_event.html|archivedate=May 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Associations and activities===\nUB has two student-run periodicals: ''[[The Spectrum (University at Buffalo)|The Spectrum]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.buffalo.edu/ |title=The Spectrum Homepage |publisher=Spectrum.buffalo.edu |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026085847/http://spectrum.buffalo.edu/ |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and ''[[Generation Magazine|Generation]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubgeneration.com/|title=Generation Magazine - The Alternative Voice since 1984|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831074329/http://ubgeneration.com/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both publications are distributed on campus.

One hundred ninety-two teams of at least six students compete in a double elimination volleyball tournament at \"The Mud Pit\" each Spring before finals. Fire trucks are brought in to saturate the dirt courts to create the mud. Awards are handed out to not only the victors, but the most creatively dressed. In the past, students have worn business suits and even dresses to the tournament.\n\nHeld annually since 1991 has been the Linda Yalem Safety Run, formerly called the Linda Yalem Memorial Run.  Linda Yalem was a sophomore at UB who was studying communications and training for the [[New York City Marathon]] when she was raped and killed by [[Altemio Sanchez]] after going for a run on the [[Ellicott Creek Bike Path]] on September 29, 1990.  The Run is held every year in her memory and to promote safety for runners.\n\nIn 1923, an honorary senior society called Bisonhead was founded.

On the North Campus, there is the Ellicott Complex, which consists of Fargo, Porter, Red Jacket, Richmond, Spaulding, and Wilkeson Quadrangles. The Ellicott Complex is also known as \"Lego Land\" because the shapes of the buildings resemble Legos stacked upon each other.  Next to Fargo Quad is the newly built in 2011 [[Bill Greiner|Greiner]] Hall, a dorm strictly for sophomores. Also on North Campus is the Governors Complex, home to the Freshman Honors Housing and various other living communities. There are also off-campus housing options close to the north campus such as The Triad Apartments.\n\nOn South Campus is Goodyear and Clement Hall. The unique aspect of these dorms is that residents share a bathroom with the adjacent room, rather than have a communal bathroom. Up until Spring of 2011, there were four other dorm buildings, referred to as \"The Quad\": MacDonald, Pritchard, Schoellkopf, and Michael Hall. Michael Hall currently exists as the Student Health Center, the other three are not in use.\n\nIn 1999, the university built its first apartment complex for families and graduate students at Flickinger Court. Since the success of Flickinger, UB has developed South Lake Village, Hadley Village, Flint Village, and Creekside Apartments.

The initial gift of $100,000 was for the purchase of what would become Townsend Hall and the remainder was to establish the university's first endowment, in her husband's name, to support the department.<ref name=\"A History of the University of Buffalo\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofunivers01park|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofunivers01park/page/81 81]|quote=University at Buffalo College of Arts & Sciences.|title= A History of the University of Buffalo |publisher=J.

In 1956, a [[Civil Engineering]] Department was formed under [[Lehigh University]] graduate [[Robert L. Ketter]], who went on to become Dean of the [[University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and later President of the University. In 1959, [[WBFO]] was launched as an AM radio station by [[University at Buffalo's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern [[National Public Radio]] personalities: [[Terri Gross]] and [[Ira Flatow]]. In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.\n\n===Acquisition by the SUNY system and second campus===\nThe private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system in 1962, and became known as the State University of New York at Buffalo. This acquisition was championed by then-Governor of New York, [[Nelson Rockefeller]].<ref>{{cite web |title=SUNY Buffalo School of Management History |url=https://mgt.buffalo.edu/about/history.html |year=2017 |publisher=University at Buffalo |accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref> As a part of the agreement to merge the university into the SUNY system, the state began to build an extensive second campus for the university. In 1964, the state acquired several hundred acres in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]] on the northeast of Buffalo, for development as a comprehensive campus for most of the non-medical disciplines at the University at Buffalo. This is often called the North Campus; it is the center of most University at Buffalo activities. The North Campus project included several major buildings, dormitory complexes, a separate spur of the interstate highway, and a new lake. The undergraduate college, the law school, and graduate schools were all moved to the new campus. During the late 1960s, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate schools: arts and letters, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. During the 1998\u20131999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences, when the faculties of Arts and Letters, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics were combined, according to a memorandum issued by the State University of New York.<ref name=\"SUNY memo\">{{cite web |url=http://system.suny.edu/media/suny/content-assets/documents/capital-facilities/campus-let-/tools/Campus-Administered-Procedures_April-2015.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding |accessdate=September 17, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1989, UB has been a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), an organization of 62 leading research universities in the United States and Canada.

The most recent estimates of UB's impact on the local and regional economies of Western New York report approximately $1.7 billion are brought into the local economy from the presence of UB. This figure is also expected to rise by 40 percent, corresponding with UB's institutional growth.\n\nOne of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan, proponents say, is the passage of S2020 and A2020 known as the UB 2020 Flexibility and Economic Growth Act, by the New York State Legislature.

In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities. Connecting all three campuses, as well as the facilities UB uses, is also a major element of the project. The firm granted the contract to lead the project is [[Beyer Blinder Belle]].\n\nThe comprehensive physical planning process is broken into four phases. Currently, UB is implementing \"phase one\" by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion. The project recognizes UB's potential for excellence, in regard to the university's physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/ub2020/plan/forum_event.html|title=Forums on UB's Physical Plan \u2013 UB 2020|publisher=Buffalo.edu|accessdate=November 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529220050/http://www.buffalo.edu/ub2020/plan/forum_event.html|archivedate=May 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n\n===Associations and activities===\nUB has two student-run periodicals: ''[[The Spectrum (University at Buffalo)|The Spectrum]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.buffalo.edu/ |title=The Spectrum Homepage |publisher=Spectrum.buffalo.edu |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026085847/http://spectrum.buffalo.edu/ |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and ''[[Generation Magazine|Generation]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubgeneration.com/|title=Generation Magazine - The Alternative Voice since 1984|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831074329/http://ubgeneration.com/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both publications are distributed on campus.

One hundred ninety-two teams of at least six students compete in a double elimination volleyball tournament at \"The Mud Pit\" each Spring before finals. Fire trucks are brought in to saturate the dirt courts to create the mud. Awards are handed out to not only the victors, but the most creatively dressed. In the past, students have worn business suits and even dresses to the tournament.\n\nHeld annually since 1991 has been the Linda Yalem Safety Run, formerly called the Linda Yalem Memorial Run.  Linda Yalem was a sophomore at UB who was studying communications and training for the [[New York City Marathon]] when she was raped and killed by [[Altemio Sanchez]] after going for a run on the [[Ellicott Creek Bike Path]] on September 29, 1990.  The Run is held every year in her memory and to promote safety for runners.\n\nIn 1923, an honorary senior society called Bisonhead was founded.

On the North Campus, there is the Ellicott Complex, which consists of Fargo, Porter, Red Jacket, Richmond, Spaulding, and Wilkeson Quadrangles. The Ellicott Complex is also known as \"Lego Land\" because the shapes of the buildings resemble Legos stacked upon each other.  Next to Fargo Quad is the newly built in 2011 [[Bill Greiner|Greiner]] Hall, a dorm strictly for sophomores. Also on North Campus is the Governors Complex, home to the Freshman Honors Housing and various other living communities. There are also off-campus housing options close to the north campus such as The Triad Apartments.\n\nOn South Campus is Goodyear and Clement Hall. The unique aspect of these dorms is that residents share a bathroom with the adjacent room, rather than have a communal bathroom. Up until Spring of 2011, there were four other dorm buildings, referred to as \"The Quad\": MacDonald, Pritchard, Schoellkopf, and Michael Hall. Michael Hall currently exists as the Student Health Center, the other three are not in use.\n\nIn 1999, the university built its first apartment complex for families and graduate students at Flickinger Court. Since the success of Flickinger, UB has developed South Lake Village, Hadley Village, Flint Village, and Creekside Apartments. Most students who wish to still live on or near the North Campus but enjoy the lifestyle of apartment living take advantage of these apartments.

It stars [[Tamsin Greig]] as Alice Chenery (a role written especially for her) and [[Michael Landes]] as Gil Raymond (Series 1 only). The series is written by [[David Renwick]], directed by [[Christine Gernon]] and was produced by [[Verity Lambert]]. This was the last programme that Lambert produced before she died. The programme was initially a critical success although its audience figures were steady rather than spectacular, netting an average of five million viewers an episode. Renwick and his former scriptwriting partner [[Andrew Marshall (writer)|Andrew Marshall]] have cameo appearances in one episode as members of a television sitcom scriptwriting team.\n\nThe second series started on 1 March 2008 and finished on 17 May 2008. This series contained changes from the first, including a switch from six 60-minute episodes, to twelve of 30 minutes (i.e. nominally the same total of six hours). Although the character of Gil was mentioned throughout the second series, and momentarily seen in the final episode (using a clip of Michael Landes from the previous series), he was not a main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk10/unplaced.shtml#unplaced_lovesoup |title=Love Soup |publisher=BBC Press Office |accessdate=20 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218012004/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk10/unplaced.shtml |archivedate=18 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe theme tune to ''Love Soup'' is \"Alley Boogie\" by [[jazz]] singer [[Georgia White]].\n\nThe first series was released on DVD in the UK on 3 December 2007.\nThe second series (and a boxset containing both series) was released on 10 May 2008.\n\n==Situation==\n'''Alice Chenery''' ([[Tamsin Greig]]) and '''Gil Raymond''' ([[Michael Landes]]) are perfect for each other. They like the same things, respect the same things, and share the same beliefs. The only problem is that they are completely unaware of each other's existence.\n\nAlice is a modern woman with old-fashioned values, who lives in [[Brighton]], and [[commuting|commutes]] to London, where she is the manager of a perfume company concession in a department store. She is trying to sell her flat and move, without success. Her love life is no success either. She can never find the perfect man. What is worse, her colleagues, '''Cleo Martin''' ([[Sheridan Smith]]) and '''Milly Russel''' ([[Montserrat Lombard]]), always seem to have more success with men, though their relationships never really last more than a week. Cleo and Milly try to pair her up with several men, but to no avail. She does have some family members (at least one cousin), but her parents, Arthur and Grace, are both dead.\n\nGil is an American comedy writer, who has moved to England to start a new project with TV producer '''Lloyd Drewitt''' ([[Owen Brenman]]). It is a series of six romantic comedies called ''Love Soup'' and he has been asked to write one of them. Things started badly for Gil when he arrived at his house (15 Carpenters Lane, Larch End), and discovered his girlfriend was seeing another man as soon as they arrived in the country. His next door neighbours are '''Bob and Irene Andrews''' ([[Brian Protheroe]] and [[Trudie Styler]]), who split up after Gil accidentally exposes Bob's affair with a prostitute. Afterwards, Gil becomes increasingly worried about Irene's intentions towards him.\n\nThe series follows both Alice and Gil's somewhat forlorn attempts to find the perfect partner, while it is clear to the viewer that they would be the ideal couple. The series itself follows each plot separately, cutting from Alice's story to Gil's throughout the episode. The only exception is the final scene of the first series, which shows Alice in the theatre watching a comedy where she is the only person in the entire audience not laughing \u2013 apart from Gil, who is sitting two rows behind her. They still do not find each other.\n\nIn the third episode of the second series, Alice arranges a date through a personal ad in a magazine. When he fails to turn up she returns home and rips up his photograph. She receives a phone call from Lloyd, telling her that his friend could not make the date. The reason is not stated on screen, but Alice, clearly shaken, picks up the torn photograph and reassembles it, it is a photo of Gil. The next episode, it is revealed that Gil died of a heart attack. In the seventh episode of the series, Alice is invited into Gil's world via Lloyd, where she begins a relationship with a writer, '''Douglas McVitie''' ([[Mark Heap]]). After a while she feels that there is little love in the relationship so she tries to break it up; Douglas, however, is determined to stay with her. Alice also moves in with '''Fae Maddison''' ([[Amelia Curtis]]), a famous actress she meets after a date goes horribly wrong.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #cccccc;\" | #\n! style=\"background: #cccccc;\" | Title\n! style=\"background: #cccccc;\" | Written by\n! style=\"background: #cccccc;\" | Duration (mins)\n|-\n|<center>1</center>\n|<center>There Must Be Some Way Out of Here</center>\n|<center>[[David Renwick]]</center>\n|<center>60</center>\n|-\n| style=\"background:white\" colspan=\"6\"| Alice becomes worried about her security after she discovers her estate agent has been doing her washing in her flat.

She later visits Gil's house and rests on the gate like Gil did in series 1. As she does this, Gil appears resting on the gate, she looks his way, doesn't see him, looks back to the house and he disappears.\n\n==Reception==\nViews of ''Love Soup'' are mixed. Andrew Billen in ''[[The Times]]'' said that, \"Like David Renwick's previous sitcom creation, [[Victor Meldrew]] [from ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''], Alice is meant to represent a bunch of prevailing attitudes. In fact, like him, she is entirely implausible. Happily, this fundamental error makes her no less funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Billen|first=Andrew|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3462716.ece?openComment=true|title=Mad Men; Love Soup: Weekend TV|work=The Times|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nJames Walton in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented negatively about the loss of Landes saying, \"In the first series Gil's job as a TV scriptwriter meant that Renwick could always add a bit of edge by attacking modern television. Without that, and with Alice remaining so utterly lovely, the tone is often surprisingly soppy.\" The basis for this was subsequently rendered redundant as Alice began to move in media circles via her association with Lloyd, Douglas and Fae. Walton also wrote however that, \"Renwick does his usual professional job with the script, and Greig is as good as ever at registering various shades of disappointment.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=James|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/03/nosplit/bvtv03last.xml|title=Weekend on television: Mad Men (BBC4, Sun) \u2013 Love Soup (BBC1, Sat) |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nSam Wollaston in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was critical of ''Love Soup'' writing, \"I don't like the fact that so little happens. Or how implausible the few things that do happen are. I know it's meant to be comedy, not a reflection of real life; but it helps if comedy can keep a toe in plausibility (unless it's so crazy, like ''[[Green Wing]]'', that it's funny for that very reason). But Milly falling in love with a shadow \u2013 actually more like a projection of a man on to the side of a van that miraculously happens outside her flat every night \u2013 well, that's just stupid. And I don't like its irritating jazzy soundtrack, or how small and British it all feels (and I mean both in the worst possible way). ''Love Soup'' is insipid broth and I've had enough already.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/03/television|title=Last night's TV|work=The Guardian|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lovesoup/ ''Love Soup''] at [[bbc.co.uk]].\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443390/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].\n* [http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/love_soup/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[British Comedy Guide]]\n* [http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/lovesoup/index.html ''Love Soup''] at British TV Comedy.\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2005_39_wed_02.shtml Woman's Hour] interview, 28 September 2005.\n\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British romance television series]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama television programmes]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = Love Soup\n|image =<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Love Soup.jpg|200px]] -->\n|caption = ''Love Soup'' intertitle\n|genre = [[Romantic comedy|Romantic]] [[comedy drama]]\n|writer = [[David Renwick]]\n|starring = [[Tamsin Greig]]<br />[[Sheridan Smith]]<br />[[Montserrat Lombard]]<br />[[Owen Brenman]]<br />[[Michael Landes]] (Series 1)<br />[[Trudie Styler]] (Series 1)<br />[[Mark Heap]] (Series 2)<br />[[Amelia Curtis]] (Series 2)\n|opentheme = \"Alley Boogie\" by [[Georgia White]]\n|endtheme = Reprise\n|country = United Kingdom\n\n|num_series = 2\n|num_episodes = 18\n|list_episodes = #Episodes\n|executive_producer = David Renwick<br />[[Jon Plowman]]\n|producer = [[Verity Lambert]]\n|runtime = 60 min.

Andrew Billen in ''[[The Times]]'' said that, \"Like David Renwick's previous sitcom creation, [[Victor Meldrew]] [from ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''], Alice is meant to represent a bunch of prevailing attitudes. In fact, like him, she is entirely implausible. Happily, this fundamental error makes her no less funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Billen|first=Andrew|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3462716.ece?openComment=true|title=Mad Men; Love Soup: Weekend TV|work=The Times|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nJames Walton in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented negatively about the loss of Landes saying, \"In the first series Gil's job as a TV scriptwriter meant that Renwick could always add a bit of edge by attacking modern television. Without that, and with Alice remaining so utterly lovely, the tone is often surprisingly soppy.\" The basis for this was subsequently rendered redundant as Alice began to move in media circles via her association with Lloyd, Douglas and Fae. Walton also wrote however that, \"Renwick does his usual professional job with the script, and Greig is as good as ever at registering various shades of disappointment.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Walton|first=James|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/03/nosplit/bvtv03last.xml|title=Weekend on television: Mad Men (BBC4, Sun) \u2013 Love Soup (BBC1, Sat) |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nSam Wollaston in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was critical of ''Love Soup'' writing, \"I don't like the fact that so little happens. Or how implausible the few things that do happen are. I know it's meant to be comedy, not a reflection of real life; but it helps if comedy can keep a toe in plausibility (unless it's so crazy, like ''[[Green Wing]]'', that it's funny for that very reason). But Milly falling in love with a shadow \u2013 actually more like a projection of a man on to the side of a van that miraculously happens outside her flat every night \u2013 well, that's just stupid. And I don't like its irritating jazzy soundtrack, or how small and British it all feels (and I mean both in the worst possible way). ''Love Soup'' is insipid broth and I've had enough already.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/03/television|title=Last night's TV|work=The Guardian|date=3 March 2008|accessdate=3 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/lovesoup/ ''Love Soup''] at [[bbc.co.uk]].\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443390/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].\n* [http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/love_soup/ ''Love Soup''] at the [[British Comedy Guide]]\n* [http://www.phill.co.uk/comedy/lovesoup/index.html ''Love Soup''] at British TV Comedy.\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2005_39_wed_02.shtml Woman's Hour] interview, 28 September 2005.\n\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s British romance television series]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama television programmes]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "name_user": "BabsEverAfter", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Soup"}
