Their use has been extended to many other meanings, more or less analogous. ''Plus'' and ''minus'' are [[Latin]] terms meaning \"more\" and \"less\", respectively.\n\n== Plus sign ==\n{{Redirect|+}}\nThe plus sign ('''+''') is a [[binary operator]] that indicates [[addition]], as in 2 + 3 = 5. It can also serve as a [[unary operator]] that leaves its [[operand]] [[identity function|unchanged]] (+''x'' means the same as ''x''). This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number, especially when contrasting with the negative (+5 versus \u22125).\n\nThe plus sign can also indicate many other operations, depending on the mathematical system under consideration. Many [[algebraic structure]]s have some operation which is called, or is equivalent to, addition. It is conventional to use the plus sign to only denote [[commutative property|commutative operation]]s.<ref name=\"Fraleigh\">{{cite book\n | last = Fraleigh\n | first = John B.\n | title = A First Course in Abstract Algebra\n | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition = 4\n | year = 1989\n | location = United States\n | pages = 52\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-201-52821-5\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>\n\n== Minus sign ==\n\n{{Redirect-distinguish|\u2212|Hyphen|Hyphen-minus|Dash}}\nThe minus sign ('''\u2212''') has three main uses in mathematics:<ref>{{Cite book|\ntitle= The Algebra Lab | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nzukMBV6ReoC&pg=PA9 | author=Henri Picciotto | publisher=Creative Publications | page=9 | isbn=978-0-88488-964-9|year = 1990}}</ref>\n# The [[subtraction]] operator: a [[binary operator]] to indicate the operation of subtraction, as in 5&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. Subtraction is the inverse of addition.\n# The [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose [[Value (mathematics)|value]] for any [[Real number|real]] or [[Complex number|complex]] [[Argument of a function|argument]] is the [[additive inverse]] of that argument. For example, if ''x'' is 3, then \u2212''x'' is \u22123, but if ''x'' is \u22123, then \u2212''x'' is 3. Similarly, {{nowrap|\u2212(\u2212''x'')}} is equal to&nbsp;''x''.\n# {{anchor|negative_sign}}A [[prefix]] of a numeric constant.  When it is placed immediately before an unsigned numeral, the combination names a negative number, the additive inverse of the positive number that the numeral would otherwise name.  In this usage, '\u22125' names a number just as 'semicircle' names a geometric figure, the difference being that 'semi' does not have a separate use as a function name.\n\nIn many contexts, it does not matter whether the second or the third of these usages is intended.  \u22125 is the same number either way.  Sometimes, it does make a difference\ua789 the programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]] uses the special character&nbsp;<code>\u00af</code> ([[Unicode]] U+00AF) for this purpose so that the interpreter of APL has less work when taking <code>\u00af{{big|5}}</code> as the number \u22125 rather than inverting the constant 5 by means of the {{nowrap|''function'' \u2212 above.}}  As described in the next section, some educators consider it important that elementary students realize that negative numbers are genuine entities that can be given names and so use a raised minus in the name of a negative number.  Similarly, in the expression language used by [[Texas Instruments]] graphing calculators (definitely at least the early models including the [[TI-81]] and [[TI-82]]) a raised minus sign is used in negative numbers (as in 2&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;5 shows <sup>\u2212</sup>3).\n\nAll three uses can be referred to as \"minus\" in everyday speech, though the binary operator is sometimes read as \"take away\". In most English-speaking countries, \u22125 (for example) is normally referred to as \"minus five\", but in modern US usage it is instead usually called \"negative five\"; here, \"minus\" may be used by speakers born before 1950, and is still popular in some contexts, but \"negative\" is usually taught as the only correct reading.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The words of mathematics |first=Steven |last=Schwartzman |year=1994 |publisher=The Mathematical Association of America |page=136}}</ref> Further, a few textbooks in the United States encourage \u2212''x'' to be read as \"the opposite of ''x''\" or \"the additive inverse of ''x''\" to avoid giving the impression that \u2212''x'' is necessarily negative.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Mathematics |first=Ruric E. |last=Wheeler |year=2001 |edition=11 |pages=171}}</ref>\n\nIn mathematics and most programming languages, the rules for the [[order of operations]] mean that \u22125<sup>2</sup> is equal to \u221225: Powers bind more strongly than the unary minus, which binds more strongly than multiplication or division. However, in some programming languages and in [[Microsoft Excel]] in particular, unary operators bind strongest, so in those cases \u22125^2 is 25 but 0\u22125^2 is \u221225.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100788861033.aspx |title=Microsoft Office Excel Calculation operators and precedence |accessdate=2009-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811090433/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HP100788861033.aspx |archivedate=2009-08-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Use in elementary education ==\n\nSome elementary teachers use raised plus and minus signs before numbers to show they are positive or negative numbers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding by design|author1=Grant P.

For example, \"C+\" is read \"C augmented chord\". Also used as [[superscript]].\n\n== Uses in computing ==\n\nAs well as the normal mathematical usage plus and minus may be used for a number of other purposes in computing.\n\nPlus and minus signs are often used in [[tree view]] on a computer screen to show if a folder is collapsed or not.\n\nIn some programming languages, [[concatenation]] of [[string (computer science)|string]]s is written <code>\"a\" + \"b\"</code>, and results in <code>\"ab\"</code>.\n\nIn most programming languages, subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII [[hyphen-minus]] character, <code>-</code>. In [[APL (programming language)|APL]] a raised minus sign (Unicode U+00AF) is used to denote a negative number, as in <code>\u00af3</code>. While in [[J (programming language)|J]] a negative number is denoted by an [[underscore]], as in <code>_5</code>.\n\nIn [[C (programming language)|C]] and some other computer programming languages, two plus signs indicate the [[Increment operator|increment]] operator and two minus signs a decrement; the position of the operator before or after the variable indicates whether the new or old value is read from it. For example, if x equals 6, then <code>y = x++</code> increments x to 7 but sets y to 6, whereas <code>y = ++x</code> would set both x and y to 7. By extension, \"++\" is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement, as in the name of the language [[C++]].\n\nIn [[regular expression]]s, \"+\" is often used to indicate \"1 or more\" in a pattern to be matched. For example, \"x+\" means \"one or more of the letter x\".\n\nThere is no concept of negative zero in mathematics, but in computing [[\u22120 (number)|\u22120]] may have a separate representation from zero. In the [[IEEE floating-point standard]], 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;\u22120 is [[negative infinity]] (\u2212<math>\\infty</math>) whereas 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;0 is [[Infinity|positive infinity]] ([[\u221e|<math>\\infty</math>]]).\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nIn chemistry, superscripted plus and minus signs are used to indicate an ion with a positive or negative charge of 1 (for example, NH{{subsup||4|+}}). If the charge is greater than 1, a number indicating the charge is written before the sign (SO{{subsup||4|2\u2212}}). The minus sign is also used (rather than an [[en dash]]) for a [[covalent bond|single covalent bond]] between two atoms, as in the [[skeletal formula]].\n\nIn physics, the use of plus and minus signs for different electrical charges was introduced by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]].\n\nSubscripted plus and minus signs are used as diacritics in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] to indicate [[Relative articulation|advanced or retracted articulations]] of speech sounds.\n\nThe minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of [[Dan language|Dan]], [[Krumen language|Krumen]], [[Karaboro languages|Karaboro]], [[Mwan language|Mwan]], [[Wan language|Wan]], [[Yaour\u00e9]], [[W\u00e8 language|W\u00e8]], [[Nyabwa language|Nyabwa]] and [[Godie language|Godi\u00e9]].<ref>Hartell, Rhonda L., ed. (1993), ''The Alphabets of Africa''. Dakar: UNESCO and SIL.</ref> The Unicode character used for the tone letter (U+02D7) is different from the mathematical minus sign.\n\nIn the [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]] used to record games of [[chess]], the plus sign (+) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into [[Check (chess)|check]]. A double plus (++) is sometimes used to denote [[double check]]. Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move (+/&minus;, +/=, =/+, &minus;/+).\n\n== Character codes ==\n\n[[File:Plus Minus Hyphen-minus.svg|thumb|Plus, minus, and hyphen-minus.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height. It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to [[ASCII]]. Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this, since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings, while U+2212 is a Unicode feature only. Also several other softwares usable for calculations don't accept the U+2212 minus. For example pasting <nowiki>=3\u22122</nowiki> into Excel or <nowiki>3\u22122=</nowiki> into the Windows calculator won't work. The true minus is not available on most [[keyboard layout]]s, although word processors might replace hyphen-minus with true minus or hyphen (U+2010, &#x2010;).\n\nThere is a [[commercial minus sign]] (<big>{{code|\u2052}}</big>), which is used in Germany and Poland. The [[division sign]] (<big>{{code|\u00f7}}</big>) is used to denote subtraction in Norway.\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed distinctions between minus signs and dashes, see {{section link|Dash|Similar Unicode characters}}.}}\n\n=== Alternative plus sign ===\n{{See also|Up tack}}\n<div style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; padding:40px; font-size:100%; font-family: Georgia; background-color: #ddddff; border: 1px solid #aaaaff;\">[[File:Altplus.svg|50px]]</div>\nA [[Jew]]ish tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write ''plus'' using the symbol \"\ufb29\".<ref name=JE>{{cite book|author=Kaufmann Kohler|editor=[[Cyrus Adler]]|display-editors=etal|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|chapter=Cross|year=1901\u20131906|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4776-cross}}</ref> This practice was adopted into [[Israel]]i schools and is still commonplace today in [[elementary school]]s (including [[secular]] schools) but in fewer [[secondary school]]s.<ref name=\"University of California\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8sWAAAAIAAJ&dq=Jewish+plus+sign&q=%22plus+sign+used+in+mathematics%22&pgis=1 Christian-Jewish Dialogue: Theological Foundations By Peter von der Osten-Sacken (1986 \u2013 Fortress Press)] {{ISBN|0-8006-0771-6}} \"In Israel the plus sign used in mathematics is represented by a horizontal stroke with a vertical hook instead of the sign otherwise used all over the world, because the latter is reminiscent of a cross.\" (Page 96)</ref> It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors, but most books for adults use the international symbol \"+\".

''Plus'' and ''minus'' are [[Latin]] terms meaning \"more\" and \"less\", respectively.\n\n== History ==\nThough the signs now seem as familiar as the [[alphabet]] or the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]], they are not of great antiquity.

This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number, especially when contrasting with the negative (+5 versus \u22125).\n\nThe plus sign can also indicate many other operations, depending on the mathematical system under consideration.

When it is placed immediately before an unsigned numeral, the combination names a negative number, the additive inverse of the positive number that the numeral would otherwise name.  In this usage, '\u22125' names a number just as 'semicircle' names a geometric figure, the difference being that 'semi' does not have a separate use as a function name.\n\nIn many contexts, it does not matter whether the second or the third of these usages is intended.  \u22125 is the same number either way.  Sometimes, it does make a difference\ua789 the programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]] uses the special character&nbsp;<code>\u00af</code> ([[Unicode]] U+00AF) for this purpose so that the interpreter of APL has less work when taking <code>\u00af{{big|5}}</code> as the number \u22125 rather than inverting the constant 5 by means of the {{nowrap|''function'' \u2212 above.}}  As described in the next section, some educators consider it important that elementary students realize that negative numbers are genuine entities that can be given names and so use a raised minus in the name of a negative number.  Similarly, in the expression language used by [[Texas Instruments]] graphing calculators (definitely at least the early models including the [[TI-81]] and [[TI-82]]) a raised minus sign is used in negative numbers (as in 2&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;5 shows <sup>\u2212</sup>3).\n\nAll three uses can be referred to as \"minus\" in everyday speech, though the binary operator is sometimes read as \"take away\". In most English-speaking countries, \u22125 (for example) is normally referred to as \"minus five\", but in modern US usage it is instead usually called \"negative five\"; here, \"minus\" may be used by speakers born before 1950, and is still popular in some contexts, but \"negative\" is usually taught as the only correct reading.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The words of mathematics |first=Steven |last=Schwartzman |year=1994 |publisher=The Mathematical Association of America |page=136}}</ref> Further, a few textbooks in the United States encourage \u2212''x'' to be read as \"the opposite of ''x''\" or \"the additive inverse of ''x''\" to avoid giving the impression that \u2212''x'' is necessarily negative.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Mathematics |first=Ruric E. |last=Wheeler |year=2001 |edition=11 |pages=171}}</ref>\n\nIn mathematics and most programming languages, the rules for the [[order of operations]] mean that \u22125<sup>2</sup> is equal to \u221225: Powers bind more strongly than the unary minus, which binds more strongly than multiplication or division.

If the charge is greater than 1, a number indicating the charge is written before the sign (SO{{subsup||4|2\u2212}}). The minus sign is also used (rather than an [[en dash]]) for a [[covalent bond|single covalent bond]] between two atoms, as in the [[skeletal formula]].\n\nIn physics, the use of plus and minus signs for different electrical charges was introduced by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]].\n\nSubscripted plus and minus signs are used as diacritics in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] to indicate [[Relative articulation|advanced or retracted articulations]] of speech sounds.\n\nThe minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of [[Dan language|Dan]], [[Krumen language|Krumen]], [[Karaboro languages|Karaboro]], [[Mwan language|Mwan]], [[Wan language|Wan]], [[Yaour\u00e9]], [[W\u00e8 language|W\u00e8]], [[Nyabwa language|Nyabwa]] and [[Godie language|Godi\u00e9]].<ref>Hartell, Rhonda L., ed. (1993), ''The Alphabets of Africa''. Dakar: UNESCO and SIL.</ref> The Unicode character used for the tone letter (U+02D7) is different from the mathematical minus sign.\n\nIn the [[Algebraic notation (chess)|algebraic notation]] used to record games of [[chess]], the plus sign (+) is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into [[Check (chess)|check]]. A double plus (++) is sometimes used to denote [[double check]]. Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move (+/&minus;, +/=, =/+, &minus;/+).\n\n== Character codes ==\n\n[[File:Plus Minus Hyphen-minus.svg|thumb|Plus, minus, and hyphen-minus.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

It is usually shorter in length than the plus sign and sometimes at a different height. It can be used as a substitute for the true minus sign when the character set is limited to [[ASCII]]. Most programming languages and other computer readable languages do this, since ASCII is generally available as a subset of most character encodings, while U+2212 is a Unicode feature only. Also several other softwares usable for calculations don't accept the U+2212 minus. For example pasting <nowiki>=3\u22122</nowiki> into Excel or <nowiki>3\u22122=</nowiki> into the Windows calculator won't work. The true minus is not available on most [[keyboard layout]]s, although word processors might replace hyphen-minus with true minus or hyphen (U+2010, &#x2010;).\n\nThere is a [[commercial minus sign]] (<big>{{code|\u2052}}</big>), which is used in Germany and Poland. The [[division sign]] (<big>{{code|\u00f7}}</big>) is used to denote subtraction in Norway.\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed distinctions between minus signs and dashes, see {{section link|Dash|Similar Unicode characters}}.}}\n\n=== Alternative plus sign ===\n{{See also|Up tack}}\n<div style=\"float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; padding:40px; font-size:100%; font-family: Georgia; background-color: #ddddff; border: 1px solid #aaaaff;\">[[File:Altplus.svg|50px]]</div>\nA [[Jew]]ish tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write ''plus'' using the symbol \"\ufb29\".<ref name=JE>{{cite book|author=Kaufmann Kohler|editor=[[Cyrus Adler]]|display-editors=etal|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|chapter=Cross|year=1901\u20131906|chapter-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4776-cross}}</ref> This practice was adopted into [[Israel]]i schools and is still commonplace today in [[elementary school]]s (including [[secular]] schools) but in fewer [[secondary school]]s.<ref name=\"University of California\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8sWAAAAIAAJ&dq=Jewish+plus+sign&q=%22plus+sign+used+in+mathematics%22&pgis=1 Christian-Jewish Dialogue: Theological Foundations By Peter von der Osten-Sacken (1986 \u2013 Fortress Press)] {{ISBN|0-8006-0771-6}} \"In Israel the plus sign used in mathematics is represented by a horizontal stroke with a vertical hook instead of the sign otherwise used all over the world, because the latter is reminiscent of a cross.\" (Page 96)</ref> It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors, but most books for adults use the international symbol \"+\".

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s.

The other parts consist of [[synthesizer]] parts by Eno using an [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] [[VCS3]] to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three [[oscillators]], producing a juddering effect. In addition, [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to [[Audio feedback|feed back]] and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the [[pitched feedback|pitch of the feedback]]. Visconti mixed out Dennis Davis' [[Bass drum|kick drum]], stating that the track \"seemed to plod\" with it but had a more energetic feel without it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Vocal gating progression===\nBowie's vocal was recorded with a \"multi-latch\" system devised by Visconti that creatively misused [[noise gate|gating]].<ref>Hodgson, Jay (2010).

Each microphone was muted as the next one was triggered.

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp. 90\u201392</ref>\n\nInspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the [[Berlin Wall]], the song tells the story of two lovers, one from [[East Berlin|East]] and one from [[West Berlin]]. Bowie's performance of {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} on [[Berlin Wall#David Bowie, 1987|June 6, 1987]], at the German [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in [[West Berlin]] has been considered a catalyst to the later [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|work=The Atlantic|last=Ford|first=Matt|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=Remembering David Bowie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112083919/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|archive-date=12 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|work=Vox|last=Fisher|first=Max|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=David Bowie at the Berlin Wall: the incredible story of a concert and its role in history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113052820/http://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|publisher=Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=9 November 2014|title=The Berlin Wall \u2013 A multimedia history: David Bowie plays Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114015829/http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|archive-date=14 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following his [[Death of David Bowie|death]] in January 2016, the German government thanked Bowie for \"helping to bring down the Wall\", adding \"you are now among Heroes\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |title=Germany to David Bowie: Thank You for Helping to Bring Down the Berlin Wall |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=11 January 2016 |accessdate=12 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004130922/http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |archive-date=4 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has received numerous accolades since its release, as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the \"greatest songs\" compiled by various music publications; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the song the 46th greatest ever, and ''[[NME]]'' named it the 15th greatest.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/david-bowie-heroes-20110525 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050101013301/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6596661/500songs|archive-date=1 January 2005|title=The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \u2013 November 2003|accessdate=26 September 2016 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref name=\"NME500\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|accessdate=15 February 2016|work=NME|title=NME The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218133410/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|archive-date=18 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork Media\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/pitchfork.htm|title=The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present|accessdate=15 January 2016|publisher=Pitchfork Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108135757/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/Pitchfork.htm|archive-date=8 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} \"is perhaps pop's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David Buckley|title=David Bowie: The Music and The Changes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|year=2015|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-617-6|page=63|access-date=22 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302054741/https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|archive-date=2 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe song title is a reference to the 1975 track \"[[Neu!

The other parts consist of [[synthesizer]] parts by Eno using an [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] [[VCS3]] to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three [[oscillators]], producing a juddering effect. In addition, [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to [[Audio feedback|feed back]] and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the [[pitched feedback|pitch of the feedback]].
