It appears on [[Roman currency]], at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public works.\n\nThe full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of [[Cicero]] and ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' (\"Books from the Founding of the City\") of [[Livy]].\n\n==Translation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nSPQR: '''''S'''en\u0101tus '''P'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''\u014dm\u0101nus''.\nIn [[Latin]], ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]]'' is a [[nominative]] singular noun meaning \"[[Roman Senate|Senate]]\". ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]][[wikt:-que|que]]'' is compounded from the nominative noun ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]]'', \"the People\", and ''[[wikt:-que|-que]]'', an [[enclitic|enclitic particle]] meaning \"and\" which [[Conjunction (grammar)|connects]] the two nominative nouns. The last word, ''[[wikt:romanus|R\u014dm\u0101nus]]'' (\"[[wikt:Rome|Roman]]\") is an [[adjective]] modifying the whole of ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]] [[wikt:populus|Populus]]que'': the \"Roman Senate and People\", taken as a whole. Thus, the phrase is translated literally as \"The Roman Senate and People\", or more freely as \"The Senate and People of Rome\".\n\n==Historical context==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nThe title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from c. 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply ''ROMA''. The abbreviation last appears on coins of [[Constantine the Great]] (ruled 312\u2013337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support [[Christianity]].\n\nThe two legal entities mentioned, ''Sen\u0101tus'' and the ''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'', are sovereign when combined. However, where ''populus'' is sovereign alone, ''Sen\u0101tus'' is not. Under the [[Roman Kingdom]], neither entity was sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation of the Republic.\n\nThis signature continued in use under the [[Roman Empire]]. The emperors were considered the ''[[de jure]]'' representatives of the people even though the ''[[Senatus consultum|sen\u0101t\u016bs consulta]]'', or decrees of the Senate, were made at the ''[[de facto]]'' pleasure of the emperor.\n\n''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'' in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of other countries, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as ''popul\u012b Pr\u012bsc\u014drum Lat\u012bn\u014drum'', \"the governments of the Old Latins\". ''R\u014dm\u0101nus'' is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in ''c\u012bvis R\u014dm\u0101nus'', \"[[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]\".\n\nThe Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as ''dignit\u0101s'', ''maiest\u0101s'', ''auctorit\u0101s'', ''l\u012bbert\u0101s popul\u012b R\u014dm\u0101n\u012b'', the \"dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people\". They were a ''populus l\u012bber'', \"a free people\". There was an ''exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honor\u0113s, consul\u0113s, volunt\u0101s'' of this same ''populus'': \"the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people\". They appear in early Latin as ''Popolus'' and ''Poplus'', so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.\n\nThe Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the [[Roman consul|consul]]s and [[praetor]]s, and the ''comitia centuri\u0101ta'', \"committee of the centuries\", whose will came to be safeguarded by the [[Tribune]]s.\n\nOne of the ways the emperor [[Commodus]] (180\u2013192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').\n\nBeginning in 1184, the [[Commune of Rome]] struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R.  From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.<ref>Monete e Zecche Medievalli Italiane, Elio Biaggi, coins 2081 and 2141</ref>\n\nDuring [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|the regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and [[manhole cover]]s in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Modern use==\nEven in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used in the municipal coat of arm of Rome and as abbreviation for the [[comune]] of Rome in official documents.<ref name=\"romeHome\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comune.roma.it/web/it/home.page |title=Roma Capitale - Sito Istituzionale - Home |accessdate=2019-10-29 |language=Italian}}</ref><ref name=\"revocaDeleghe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comune.roma.it/PCR/resources/cms/documents/Ord.1Revoca_deleghe_Naim.pdf |publisher=S.P.Q.R. - ROMA CAPITALE - MUNICIPIO ROMA CENTRO STORICO |title=OGGETTO: Revoca deleghe Consigliera Nathalie Naim |language=Italian |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===Civic references===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Insigne_Romanum_coronatum.svg|thumb|upright|Modern coat of arms of Rome municipality.]]\n[[File:Romeinse vlag.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern recreation of a [[aquila (Roman)|Roman standard]].]]\n[[File:2011-06-22-hh-buergerschaft-by-RalfR-04.jpg|thumb|right|SPQH - [[Hamburg Rathaus]]]]\n''SPQx'' is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights.

It appears on [[Roman currency]], at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public works.\n\nThe full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of [[Cicero]] and ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' (\"Books from the Founding of the City\") of [[Livy]].\n\n==Translation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nSPQR: '''''S'''en\u0101tus '''P'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''\u014dm\u0101nus''.\nIn [[Latin]], ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]]'' is a [[nominative]] singular noun meaning \"[[Roman Senate|Senate]]\". ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]][[wikt:-que|que]]'' is compounded from the nominative noun ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]]'', \"the People\", and ''[[wikt:-que|-que]]'', an [[enclitic|enclitic particle]] meaning \"and\" which [[Conjunction (grammar)|connects]] the two nominative nouns. The last word, ''[[wikt:romanus|R\u014dm\u0101nus]]'' (\"[[wikt:Rome|Roman]]\") is an [[adjective]] modifying the whole of ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]] [[wikt:populus|Populus]]que'': the \"Roman Senate and People\", taken as a whole. Thus, the phrase is translated literally as \"The Roman Senate and People\", or more freely as \"The Senate and People of Rome\".\n\n==Historical context==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nThe title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from c. 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply ''ROMA''. The abbreviation last appears on coins of [[Constantine the Great]] (ruled 312\u2013337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support [[Christianity]].\n\nThe two legal entities mentioned, ''Sen\u0101tus'' and the ''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'', are sovereign when combined. However, where ''populus'' is sovereign alone, ''Sen\u0101tus'' is not. Under the [[Roman Kingdom]], neither entity was sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation of the Republic.\n\nThis signature continued in use under the [[Roman Empire]]. The emperors were considered the ''[[de jure]]'' representatives of the people even though the ''[[Senatus consultum|sen\u0101t\u016bs consulta]]'', or decrees of the Senate, were made at the ''[[de facto]]'' pleasure of the emperor.\n\n''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'' in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of other countries, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as ''popul\u012b Pr\u012bsc\u014drum Lat\u012bn\u014drum'', \"the governments of the Old Latins\". ''R\u014dm\u0101nus'' is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in ''c\u012bvis R\u014dm\u0101nus'', \"[[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]\".\n\nThe Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as ''dignit\u0101s'', ''maiest\u0101s'', ''auctorit\u0101s'', ''l\u012bbert\u0101s popul\u012b R\u014dm\u0101n\u012b'', the \"dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people\". They were a ''populus l\u012bber'', \"a free people\". There was an ''exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honor\u0113s, consul\u0113s, volunt\u0101s'' of this same ''populus'': \"the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people\". They appear in early Latin as ''Popolus'' and ''Poplus'', so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.\n\nThe Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the [[Roman consul|consul]]s and [[praetor]]s, and the ''comitia centuri\u0101ta'', \"committee of the centuries\", whose will came to be safeguarded by the [[Tribune]]s.\n\nOne of the ways the emperor [[Commodus]] (180\u2013192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').\n\nBeginning in 1184, the [[Commune of Rome]] struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R.  From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.<ref>Monete e Zecche Medievalli Italiane, Elio Biaggi, coins 2081 and 2141</ref>\n\nDuring [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|the regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and [[manhole cover]]s in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Modern use==\nEven in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used in the municipal coat of arm of Rome and as abbreviation for the [[comune]] of Rome in official documents.<ref name=\"romeHome\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comune.roma.it/web/it/home.page |title=Roma Capitale - Sito Istituzionale - Home |accessdate=2019-10-29 |language=Italian}}</ref><ref name=\"revocaDeleghe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comune.roma.it/PCR/resources/cms/documents/Ord.1Revoca_deleghe_Naim.pdf |publisher=S.P.Q.R. - ROMA CAPITALE - MUNICIPIO ROMA CENTRO STORICO |title=OGGETTO: Revoca deleghe Consigliera Nathalie Naim |language=Italian |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===Civic references===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Insigne_Romanum_coronatum.svg|thumb|upright|Modern coat of arms of Rome municipality.]]\n[[File:Romeinse vlag.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern recreation of a [[aquila (Roman)|Roman standard]].]]\n[[File:2011-06-22-hh-buergerschaft-by-RalfR-04.jpg|thumb|right|SPQH - [[Hamburg Rathaus]]]]\n''SPQx'' is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights.

The Qureish wanted him to divorce her, but he was steadfast in refusing to do that. However, he did not become a Muslim either, and this annoyed his father-in-law. At one point, as part of a ransom negotiation, Muhammad (who was living in Medina at that time), stipulated that Zainab should be sent to live with him in Medina, and her husband was compelled to agree, but still he did not divorce her, nor did he take another wife. Four years later, while he was taking a trade caravan to Syria, he was waylaid in the vicinity of Medina by bandits/muslims and his goods were taken from him. In return for getting back the goods, he agreed to accept Islam. In the bargain, his wife Zainab was restored to him. Zainab and her devoted husband had two children, a son [[Ali ibn Zainab|Ali]], who died young, and a daughter [[Umamah bint Zainab|Umamah]], who married twice and had two sons, but both of them died childless.

In all countries, it is the responsibility of the mother's [[physician]], [[midwife]], hospital administrator, or the parent(s) of the child to see that the birth is properly registered with the appropriate [[government agency]].\n\nThe actual record of birth is stored with a government agency. That agency will issue certified copies or representations of the original birth record upon request, which can be used to apply for government benefits, such as [[passports]]. The certification is signed and/or sealed by the registrar or other custodian of birth records, who is commissioned by the government.\n\nThe right of every child to a name and nationality, and the responsibility of national governments to achieve this are contained in Articles 7 and 8 in the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]: \"The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality...\" (CRC Article 7) and \"States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations...\" (CRC Article 8).<ref>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |date=11 June 2010 }} (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1989), accessed 17 May 2011.</ref>\n\n{{quote|...it's a small paper but it actually establishes who you are and gives access to the rights and the privileges, and the obligations, of citizenship.|source=[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], February 2005<ref name=\"Plan International 2005\">''Universal Birth Registration \u2014 A Universal Responsibility'' (Woking: Plan International, 2005)</ref>}}\n\nDespite 191 countries ratifying the Convention, the births of millions of children worldwide go unregistered.

Unlike the British system of recording all births in \"registers\", the states file an individual document for each and every birth.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/panelreport_acc.pdf ''Report of the panel to evaluate the standard U.S. certificates''] (Division of Vital Statistics National&mdash; Center for Health Statistics, April 2000, addenda November 2001).</ref>\n\nThe U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births.

From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]]. Unlike the British system of recording all births in \"registers\", the states file an individual document for each and every birth.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/panelreport_acc.pdf ''Report of the panel to evaluate the standard U.S. certificates''] (Division of Vital Statistics National&mdash; Center for Health Statistics, April 2000, addenda November 2001).</ref>\n\nThe U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births.
