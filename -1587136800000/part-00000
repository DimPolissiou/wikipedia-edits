He calls the first subregion \"[[Northern New Mexico]]\", and describes it as focused on [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes called [[Central New Mexico]].\n\n\"Central Arizona\" is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. The city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is the largest urban center, and located in the approximate center of the area that includes [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and many others.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 103\u2013106</ref>\n\nMeinig calls the third subregion \"El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern Borderlands\". While [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] are distinctly different cities, they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them. [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]]. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]. El Paso's influence extends north into the [[Mesilla Valley]], and southeast along the Rio Grande into the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of Texas.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 112\u2013114</ref>\n\nThe fourth subregion Meinig calls the \"Northern Corridor and Navajolands\".

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada. This will be the defined scope which is used in this article, unless otherwise specified in a particular area.<ref name=LCASDefine />\n\n===Geological/topographical===\nFrom this perspective, almost all of the region's physiographical traits, geological formations, and weather are contained within a box between 26\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 northern latitude, and 98\u00b0 30' and  124\u00b0 western longitude.<ref name=UAtsd>{{cite web | url=http://jsw.library.arizona.edu/3403/defined.html | publisher=University of Arizona | title=The Southwest Defined | editor-last=Wilder | editor-first=Joseph Carlton | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological===\nWhen looking at the fauna of the region, there is a broader definition of the American Southwest. The Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research defines the Southwest as being only the states of Arizona, New Mexico, with parts of California, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; although they include all of those six states in their map of the region, solely for ease of defining the border.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://southwesternherp.com/americansouthwestdefined.html | publisher=Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research | title=The American Southwest Defined | accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural===\n[[File:LCASMapoftheSouthwest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Southwestern United States as defined by the Learning Center of the American Southwest<ref name=LCASDefine/>]]\nParts of the other states make up the various areas which can be included in the Southwest, depending on the source.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

Considered a [[Small satellite|nano satellite]] for it's weight of less than 20 kg, its main mission was forwarding communications between far reaching points of the [[Earth]] such as [[Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base]] from [[Peninsular Spain|mainland Spain]]. This was possible due to its [[polar orbit]] and altitude of 650 km above sea level. During an operational run the data obtained in the [[Antarctic]] would be uploaded to the satellite during its fly by and then, downloaded in Spain when satellite reached the [[Iberian Peninsula]].\n\nWhen its service life came to an end in 2009, it was replaced by the [[Nanosat-1B]], also developed by INTA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/n/nanosat-1b|title=NanoSat-1B - eoPortal Directory - Satellite Missions|website=earth.esa.int|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Objectives ==\nNanosat 01 was a low-cost [[technology demonstration]] nano satellite.<ref>A.

The centerpiece of the device was a Sol\u2013Gel Faraday rotor, consisting in several rods of a dispersion of [[Austenite|\u03b3]]-[[Iron(III) oxide|Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]] (less than 15 nm in size) suspended in an amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] lattice. These rods were stacked inside a [[Polarimetry|polarimetric]] dome (itself being composed of several layers of [[Polarizer|polarizers]]) responsible of directing light beams produced by a [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] towards the rods longitudinally. When the light propagated inside the rods along their axis, the magnetic field created by the austenite nanoparticles would interact with it causing the rotation of the polarizers. This rotation would be perceived as change in the intensity of the light measured by four [[Photodiode|photodiodes]] allocated new to the exiting end of each rod. The data collected by the photodetectors would then be processed in the OBDH which was capable of providing accurate readings (up to 10 [[Tesla (unit)|nT]]) on both the satellite's attitude and the value of the geomagnetic field.\n\nThe usage of the silica / \u03b3-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> composite was driven by the search of a material capable of providing good mechanical properties with a high degree of [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], high [[Verdet constant]] and [[superparamagnetism]] in order to avoid remnant [[magnetism]] and facilitate measuring the intensity of the light.\n\nIn addition, it contained several coils designed to compensate possible variations of Verdet constant due to changes in temperature or [[wavelength]] inside the sensor. And a stabilized power source for the LED. Both subsystems were also used when calibrating the sensor midflight. The device had a diameter of 20 mm and less than 5 mm in thickness with a total weight of 200 g with less than 2 W of power consumption. \n\nIts conception was the result of more than 7 years of joint research between the ''Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid'' (ICMM subdivision of the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) and INTA.

An additional line was added to simulate a zero on the sensor, thus giving, by comparison, the number an nature of the pulses resulted from undesired SETs interacting with the system. This helped further understanding the nature of [[ionizing radiation]] in space and [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]] the received signal.<ref>Santiago Rodriguez, Ignacio Arruego, Nikos Karafolas, Patrice Pelisou, Francisco Tortosa, Bernard Alison, Maite Alvarez, Victor Apestigue, Joaquin Azcue, Juan Barbero, Claude Carron, Jordi Catalan, Jose Ramon De Mingo, Jose Angel Dominguez, Paloma Gallego, Juan Garcia-Prieto, Juan Jose Jimenez, Demetrio Lopez, Francisco Lopez-Hernandez, Alberto Martin-Ortega, Javier Martinez-Oter, Gerald Mercadier, Francisco Peran, Ayaya Perera, Rafael Perz, Enrique Poves, Jose Rabadan, Manuel Reina, Joaquin Rivas, Helene Rouault, Julio Rufo, Claudia Ruiz de Galaterra, Denis Scheidel, Christophe Theroude, Marco van Uffelen, Jaime Sanchez-Paramo, Errico Armandillo, Patrick Plancke, Hector Guerrero, \u201cOptical Wireless Intra-Spacecraft Communications,\u201d Proceedings of the 7th ICSO (International Conference on Space Optics) 2008, Toulouse, France, Oct. 14-17, 2008</ref>\n\n==== Second Experiment ====\nKnown as the '''OWLS-BER''', the second experiment was to perform a [[Closed-loop communication|closed-loop link]] in a [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]] bus belonging to the OBC. To archive this, pulses of data were sent from optical emitters towards the inner walls of the satellite, and the diffused light collected by a receiver. When the transmission was over, the OBC compared the data received to the calculations of the BER.\n\nThe whole experiment was carried in a separated [[Frequency-division multiple access|FDMA (Frequency-Division Multiple-Access)]] capable channel (4 MHz), equipped with [[Amplitude-shift keying|ASK]]. It was also possible to control from ground and, to a certain extend, filter interferes in the data rate of 100 and 100 kbits/s.\n== See also ==\n\n* \n\n* [[Nanosat-1B]]\n* [[Communications satellite]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />{{Space program of Spain}}{{Orbital launches in 2004}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2004]]\n[[Category:Satellites of Spain]]\n[[Category:Communications satellites in low Earth orbit]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by Ariane rockets]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "style", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosat_01"}
